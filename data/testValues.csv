"1","""Eat rich foods ... peanut butter ...""!

This is how I survive. Before I acknowledged I had ADHD, I already had enough trouble eating. Now that I've been medicated for over a year, I still don't even feel hungry most of the time.

To make sure I don't lose a bunch of weight, and have energy during the day, I eat energy and protein rich foods. Peanut butter is a must for me. And I make sure there's near to no 'added sugars' in my diet. My carbs come from fruits and vegetables. 

I still don't feel hungry most days, yet I started gaining muscle mass again so seems to be working! 

Hope this helps! ","d8bhnmc",1,1475454040,"2016-10-03 00:20:40"

It is impossible to confirm whether anyone born before ~1900 had ADHD. While there was some references in medical literature starting to form around this time, the focus was only on children (and mostly children who were under-performing).

To this day people who are successful often don't feel the need to be diagnosed for ADHD. I have heard that Richard Branson probably has it, but he might decide not to pursue a diagnosis because what he is doing (living passionately) has worked for him and he doesn't want to be placed into a box.

I haven't read much about Einstein but I do know he had many many experiments going on at once and would often bounce between them when interest (and attention) waned.

Davinci is another name which has come up often.

I wish that in today's culture it was more acceptable for people in influential positions to come out and say they have ADHD and share how it has impacted them. I know Nick Cannon has as has Shane Victorino (Phillies player) but there are few successful role models with ADHD (who have shared it publically). Recently Catherine Zeta Jones admitted she had bi-polar and it was huge news. Unfortunately mental health is not really understood by the general public.

So there is a little information and rant. Hope it was helpful!","cbp8sqz",5,1376686297,"2013-08-16 20:51:37"

"31","1) read the table of contents thoroughly, they should give you a glimpse on what to expect

 2) skim by chapters.  Make note of the chapter name. Chapter names are very important.

 3) when skimming, read the headings. They should give you an idea of how the information is organized and conveyed (your professor might be doing the same thing too)

 4) go through the section and read the italicized/bold words, they are probably formatted that way for a reason

 5) read the chapter all over again, you should know what to expect throughout the chapter while you read

I often lea. Into being the ""lovable idiot"" (emphasis on lovable) because who wants to be the person who always talks about their mentall illness and turns a funny moment into one where they talk about their struggles...

Idk if this is ADHD but sometimes I have a really hard time talking. I can't thing of the word I want, so in my frustration I make a term up. My boyfriend thinks it's adorable, and if he didn't have ADHD as well, I think it would be a lot more insulting. 

I don't know if I could date anyone without ADHD because I feel like I'd be seen even more idiot and not taken seriously.... obviously not by every person, and I know there are successful relationships between people with and without ADHD, but from the way some of my friends treat me sometimes I often wonder.

That being said, I'm lucky to have a few close friends who idk if they have ADHD, but they seem that have some character traits that make them forgetful, impulsive, etc, just not fully as a disability/enough for a diagnosis. They get it, and it's so goddamn refreshing.

"38","If you think some facts will change his mind (not always true, but we'll see):

* Kids with ADHD who don't use medication are more likely to use illegal drugs. Kids with ADHD who do use medication are less likely to use illegal drugs. I know which one I'd prefer.
* Medications for ADHD have advanced quite a bit since he was a kid. There are more different types, different dosing schemes, etc.
* Knowledge of *how* to prescribe for ADHD has advanced quite a bit, as well. Now we know that ""zombification"" often means overmedication, and decreasing the dose can be just as effective as increasing it.
* The evidence shows that behavioral therapy + medication is far more effective than therapy alone.

(Assuming he is a biological parent) You do want to take his experience seriously, because it's likely that they share biology. It sounds like it was pretty bad if two weeks of medication as a child have made him this afraid as an adult.

* If he had a bad experience with Adderall, you might start your kid with Ritalin instead. If he had a bad experience with immediate-release formulations, you might start with extended/continuous release medications.
* You could agree to start him on a much lower dose than normal. Usually you would start with lower doses anyway, but you could start even lower, if that makes his father feel better, and ramp up the medication at an even slower rate.
* You could agree to ""medication holidays"" while he's with his father (sounds like maybe this is on the weekends?)
* Does he remember exactly why he didn't like his experience? If he can articulate them, say with a written list that you have access to, you can promise to specifically watch out for those effects. For example, if he felt ""zombified"", you can promise to regularly ask your kid (say, once a week) if he feels less interested in his activities. Did it make his heart beat really fast, or make him very anxious, or give him panic attacks? You can regularly ask your kid about anxious thoughts. Did it trigger psychosis or mania (rare, but possible)? If so, that's very scary and he might even be right about not giving your kid the same medication.

He might be in denial not only about your son, but about himself. This is going to be tough for everyone. Good luck!","dsua0xj",2,1516230359,"2018-01-17 23:05:59"

You have a condition that means your brain doesn't really process the idea of a 'future' the way everyone else's does. You live in the here and now so the idea of saving up might *seem* important, but it doesn't motivate you enough to actually do it.  
  
However, because your brain has spent years and years coming up with coping techniques to help you live with this condition, you're bound to be in a position where you're sort of conditioned to just accept this behaviour.   
  
My doctor says to me 'Medication is only part of the treatment'. ADHD people get into bad habits and they can take years to get out.

I'm still on 18 and it feels like I'm on nothing at all.

However I'll point out one thing and ask a few questions. When I went off the Vyvanse, despite tapering down I've had a hard time adjusting. It made me feel very ill, tired, headachy, and my blood sugar was wonky. (In my history you can find where I responded to a post about ADHD meds and blood sugar that was very insightful and helpful to me!)

My questions are: are you getting enough sleep? Exercising every day? Drinking a LOT of water? Eating healthy? I just posted to ask if Concerta is affected by these things as Adderall meds, because there isn't much online, but I suspect the answer will be yes.

With your sleep it isn't just amount but also whether it is regular. Sleeping in on the weekends and taking my meds later than usual messes me up.

"89","It refers to stimulating (=waking up) the prefrontal lobe, it's functions can be (roughly) summarized as **Self-Control**.

This brain region is the primary culprit (and treatment target) for ADHD and secondary player in Anxiety, Depression, Mood and Addictive Disorders. All ADHD-medications directly or indirectly affect this brain region through influencing Norepinephrine¹ Levels. The more famous Dopamine Metabolises (""grows"") into Norepinephrine. Stimulants increase both Dopamine and Norepinephrine. Recent insights are beginning to cause a shift in focus from Dopamine to Norepinephrine pathways as the primary treatment option.

¹Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter that allows the Auto-Pilot to take over if it is absent, induces alertness in moderate volumes (this is the good stuff), anxiety in higher volumes and initiates the fight/flight/freeze function in extreme volumes (flooding). The higher you go the less Self-Control and the more ""animalistic"" you get, too low and you go on Auto-Pilot (habits, feeding, hoarding, resting, binging etc.) So it is a very delicate balance of Norepinephrine levels that allows for this ""alert"" state. Clearly with ADHD this balance is entirely out of whack!

So ironically it would lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of self-stimulation to gain more executive control, which *could* be used for stopping the self-stimulation... but that's what's inducing the increased control, *so nuh-uh!*","eingmmu",1,1552727757,"2019-03-16 09:15:57"

I think CBT deals with that? The idea is to reframe the action you're doing, and doing nothing(or observing), or doing something else instead. Never done CBT, so not much knowledge to impart. The way I've gotten rid of bad habits in the past is to notice when I'm doing them, and then not doing them/telling myself not to do them. Not in a negative spiral kind of way, but more in a ""this serves no purpose, I'm going to stop"" kind of way. Hopefully that makes sense? Also hope it doesn't sound condescending or ""just focus, and your problems will be gone"" kinda way, it wasn't intended like that :/","f65cwen",1,1572701174,"2019-11-02 13:26:14"

The problem as already stated is there will be no long-term recollection of this information and it really does hinder you in the long run outside the school environment.

You may also find it difficult to master/develop your understanding of topics. You'll likely find yourself at an intermediate level at various subjects and unable to pursue them further because of the lack strategies/effort/motivation required to elevate your knowledge of them further. This one really gets to me and I've noticed when medicated I can build on top of previous knowledge more easily (not without side effects unfortunately).

"113","Like others.... skimming anyway not patient enough today, I think it is somewhat an adaptation to our emotional sensitivity.  We had to be logical almost to a fault internally to balance off our emotional disregulation.  We have to build very logical structures to keep ourselves on track, rules that logically lead to the next step one by one without much wiggle room for distraction or allowing emotion to take over. 

Also it's somewhat a gendered thing I am fairly sure (my most hated word right now.. ''mansplain'' which is thrown out when it is assumed we are ''problem fixing'' with no regard for emotion.) What seems to be missed in the criticism of this is that we are thinking emotional people, and that when we do these things we are operating from a place of loving kindness.  So there is in a way a lack of empathy in the moment both ways, but ''we''over logicals are often definitely in the ''more wrong'' position.  I think CBT could be beneficial for this, as I go through the executive defecits listed and mentioned by Dr. Barkely and the situations I have managed to knock this issue out of the park, executing a very smooth and positive social interaction for both parties and avoiding over analyzing their problem or offering more than the simplest of advice.

When I did this it was because I did a quick evaluation before I spoke.  Who is this person to me, who am I to them, what is the goal of this interaction, what is my goal with this personal relationship, is this impulse to launch into a logical in depth analysis verbally productive towards those goals.   No.  Loop back ; distill large thought to a single leading thought, sideline it, express sympathy or empathy depending on what you are capable or is appropriate given context, and consider once more whether even a tiny thought is appropriate for the person's emotional state.

I think it's also just being actively present in the moment.  When I get lost thinking of my reply instead of what's being said or do this kind of thing I'm operating out of my ''thought cloud'' which is just how I describe my normal kind of nebulous scattered (yet intelligent and smart) thoughts.  It's different from generating a verbal stream of words and images in my head which is concrete and allows impulse control.  

I'm rambling... but yeah.  Logic to counterbalance emotionality.   Now that your emotions are mildly supressed by medication those adaptations are a bit over presented. 

CBT therapy is IMO vital for adults.  Your brain systems are there but they are weak and disused, and it will take real cognitive effort to utilize and strengthen them.  Having goals in mind is a biggie.

And lastly... we tend to try to help with our strength (lateral thinking and problem solving) because it is our strength and using it helps shire up our weakness (in general poor ego/self worth, due to misattribution of laziness and even this issue itself.)

Edit : double last : I think because there can be/is a detriment to self direction and self soothing cognitively we rely on creating external solutions.  We discount that others can soothe our emotions and offer advice based on our own needs and coping mechanisms.  That is to say we always default to the most basic fundamental emotional coping mechanism, removal of the stressor or ourselves from the stressor, because we cannot just ''cope'' with a sustained emotional stimuli like others.

That's why others want to be comforted... because they may not actually need the problem to be fixed or solved,  they may be on some level satisfied with a small stressor for other reasons, and just want a little support in their coping.","d1hueai",2,1459269214,"2016-03-29 16:33:34"

"136","The scientific literature is unclear on the neurological causes for ADHD and working memory (WM) impairments. However, there is growing belief that ADHD is caused primarily by improper activation and decreased functional connectivity between different brain regions.

[This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120250/), for example, found that stimulant medication increases WM performance by strengthening and generating connections between WM-specialized regions and other brain structures:

&gt; Insofar as increased connectivity reflects enhanced inter-regional communication, this indicates that the net effect of psychostimulants is to facilitate neurotransmission through long-distance connections between widespread brain regions. Many of these putatively “re-connected” brain regions ... have been shown in previous fMRI/PET studies to be dysfunctional in ADHD.

The authors' findings support the suggestion that the cause for WM impairment in ADHD people is widespread decreased functional brain connectivity.

WM can be defined as the mental workspace where information is kept in a highly active state, available for use by a variety of other cognitive processes. WM includes the processes that encode, store, and manipulate this actively-held information.[1](http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/students/fougnidl/Fougnie-chap1.pdf) These WM processes all seem to be performed by different brain regions. 

To illustrate, WM is used in doing a math problem by actively keeping the numbers in mind, while simultaneously retrieving the necessary equation from long-term memory, and then applying it. Learning new stuff similarly requires WM to temporarily store information, process its meaning, associate it with previously-acquired knowledge in long-term memory, and file it away in the appropriate mental space. Impaired WM would suggest a reduced ability to select, activate and communicate between the appropriate brain regions.

So as for your question specifically... if the information is absorbed and then gone in seconds because you're distracted, that may be because only one part of your WM process is activated (brain network/regions for encoding), whereas the networks/regions for retaining and filing the information away into long-term storage are not properly activated and integrated?

"167","This one comes up quite a bit as they sometimes seem at odds with each other. As I understand it ocd can even be misdiagnosed in childhood as ADHD. However as someone who has both I see them as having a pretty notable difference - Adhd is being unable to focus or sustain focus on something that you want to focus on. OCD is an inability to stop obsessing over something that you do not want to focus on. Put another way - in my case the times when my mind wanders or I can’t get started on a boring task are not always because I am obsessing. I would hazard a guess that if whenever you cannot focus it is because of obsessions then that would be more ocd. But if your inattentive symptoms show up regardless of obsessions then likely that is a co morbidity. Just my two cents! ","duvajgg",3,1519676467,"2018-02-26 20:21:07"

Anyway, when I got hangovers before I took medication I did notice the the add symptoms went away.

No hyper component at all), and I use strattera and remeron, which work like wonder drugs. The best advice I could give you is to try medication. The strattera works as an anti depressant for me, it doesn't do much for focus, but is absolutely killer as an anti depressant. I definitely recommend trying strattera if you're ready for a change. The first day I took it, it gave me asmr and I felt amazingly content, so there's a chance it could work right away.

This is making me think it’s not adhd but Maladaptive daydreaming. 

A person who is purported to have maladaptive daydreaming may have one or more symptoms of the disorder, but not necessarily all of them. Common symptoms include:

extremely vivid daydreams with their own characters, settings, plots, and other detailed, story-like features

daydreams triggered by real-life events

difficulty completing everyday tasks

difficulty sleeping at night

an overwhelming desire to continue daydreaming
performing repetitive movements while daydreaming

making facial expressions while daydreaming

whispering and talking while daydreaming

daydreaming for lengthy periods (many minutes to hours)

I could be wrong but I had a friend with this. I’m only adhd and while I do daydream it’s not for more than say 30 min because I get distracted from my daydream. Being able to daydream that long is impressive. Lots of people listen to music while they do this. 
Wether it’s maladaptive daydreaming or ADHD you need to go to a psychiatrist or therapist. Your regular doctor will not know about maladaptive daydreaming and even so it’s best to be diagnosed by a professional for ether of these conditions.

"191","We've got a pretty similar situation though I'm diagnosed bipolar + ADHD and maybe ASD. Co-morbidity sucks.

I was very social before mental illness developed and have to do my best to maintain a regular social life, even by including work as being social. Psychologically and emotionally it's better to have even just superficial contact than none at all so keep reaching out. Surprisingly I made great friends at times when I felt the most isolated. The 'learn and forget' issue + emotional disconnection from sensitivity is the bane of my existence and got worse over time. It was a sad day forgetting how to talk to my best friend of 20 years. You won't feel connect all the time but there's bright spots where you'll be glad you tried.

How well do you manage hyperempathy and sensitivity? Being sensitive causes a lot of anxiety and my psychiatrist is letting me trial medications for this. I've had anxiety for ages and it's likely that chronic anxiety normalises fear responses which can be difficult to get rid of, hence we can't learn without constant reinforcement. Also chronic anxiety causes memory issues, which is just icing on the cake. Talk your psych about your problems and emphasise how debilitating it is. My mistake was pretending I didn't need help and could eventually learn to be brave. Nope.

Uni became too much for me. Ritalin made me focus, sit still and retain some information but anxiety made me not care. My future is on the line and my brain would rather chill, which I guess is what anxiety wants us to do.

5. Writing lists. I found Microsoft To-Do to be wicked helpful, along with Samsung Notes for my Note 8, also Google calendar to remember appointments and upcoming events across multiple platforms. Good support system is also important. I have people I can talk to and I go to therapy weekly to work on my...other (trauma-related) issues.

Positives (to me at least) stemming from my ADHD:

Ability to marathon game. My hyperfocus allows me to play video games for (&gt;8) hours on end with no issues.

Passive listening, particularly effective when working in a customer service environment. Focus on every third or so word they say to get the general idea. Helps to avoid overthinking everything they are complaining about.","ee39k6k",1,1547516946,"2019-01-15 01:49:06"

The key thing I am taking away from all of this is to keep my damn mouth shut and closely pay attention to someone when they are talking.

"199","It's impairment all the way for me. I don't get to choose what I hyperfixate on and sometimes it's not productive. For example sometimes I just want to write music, but then all my attention gets stuck on designing a sound and the next thing I know 4 hours have passed and I'm not any closer to finishing my song. And I'm now burned out and get disappointed in myself for yet again not being able to regulate my attention to do what I actually want to do. And then maybe I want to learn another new skill to improve my music but I can't focus, read, or watch anything enough to internalize it.

And the other thing is I don't know how others feel about hyperfixating, but it's not an enjoyable experience sometimes. I can end up putting myself through tremendous stress and my brain says keep going. I skip food, don't drink water, don't talk to people, don't do the shit I need to do or planned to do. 

I just don't get the superpower thing. Even if we lived in a society built for us I'd still have issues. Unless we lived in a society where you were given money to live on, I could sleep anytime when I felt like it, and basically freedom to do whatever I want when I want, I'd be ""fine"" but only because there would be nothing to go wrong because of being dysfunctional. Clearly a dream scenario. 

So yeah all impairment all the time. ADHD has been something that's wrecked my life and I didn't even realize it until now at the age of 29. So no I definitely don't consider it a superpower when a good quarter of my life was robbed from me.","gd9m2j7",2,1606082422,"2020-11-22 22:00:22"

"203","I felt similarly until I took meds for the first time, my mind went quiet, and I could get stuff done like normal people.  I could tidy up the house quickly without being sidetracked by everything in the house and finding myself doing some random other thing 2 hours later. Etc, etc.  It's not about giving yourself an unfair advantage when you have ADHD -- it's about not working 10 times as hard as neurotypical people to accomplish the same things.  They've done brain studies on people with ADHD and they actually get more mind wandering when they try harder to focus, whereas a normal brain is able to suppress mind wandering.  We can't suppress it any more than a person can will themselves to sleep if they're not tired.

A month is a long time for a (stimulants) med trial, btw.  Especially when for about 1/3 of people one of the meds doesn't work at all (for me Concerta/ritalin does nothing, but Adderall helps, for instance, for others it's the reverse, or both work).  Two weeks is good because it will give you a chance to get past the initial side effects and any euphoria and settle down into what it will feel like long-term, without being stuck with something that doesn't work if the one you start with doesn't work with your particular brain.  &lt;-- although I am not a psychiatrist.  I've just read a ton and I'm in the middle of meds titration, myself.  And, nonstimulants are different stratterra for instance will take at least two weeks for it to start working.

We continued speech and OT and when he turned 4 ABA was suggested to help him adjust to more of a classroom around multiple kids environment. Thus needing a full psychological evaluation done. His psychologist looked at me crazy when I said he didn’t score like someone diagnosed with ASD. When she ran multiple tests herself, it was true he did not score for ASD still but she confirmed ADHD. We have another appointment in June to reevaluate him for both ASD and ADHD. I understand the signs for both ASD and ADHD are very similar so it could very well be he isn’t ADHD but stage 1 autistic.

Ever since I’ve managed to finalize multiple internships I have come to one realization which is that employees can be very judgmental and there are a lot of misunderstandings when it comes to ADHD/ADD or other disorders because they assume that everything will overwhelm me or that I will not comprehend a single thing but this is not the case, however some will underestimate your abilities and deliberately decrease the amount of tasks you’re permitted to do.

So personally I wouldn’t say it to anyone except for when it’s really necessary or when I think that I will be in an uncomfortable situation or something that I need to be prepared for in advance, but I don’t want my disorder to define the individual that I happen to be but rather to see as every singular human being on this planet and not as a “burden” or a “special” person, but if you notice that your symptoms are increasing insist you to tell it (myself and others in that case) just remember that nobody can obligate you to address your mental health conditions unless you know that it will be an obstacle in your academic/private life.","g7g79xh",1,1601674383,"2020-10-02 21:33:03"

I talked about my terrible memory, how it’s effecting me in real time, my horrible lack of time sense, how i can hyper focus on things. I mostly mentioned things that I could relate smth else to. Like I have a horrible sense of time so that’s dragging me down at work. 

But mostly I was just super insistent that I be referred bc they can’t diagnose you, they can only refer you. ","ej22nr5",1,1553191712,"2019-03-21 18:08:32"

If they give me the slightest issue I simply say ""if there's a problem, please take it up with the doctor"".  

If you're in the US and they ever refuse to fill your prescription, simply call your doctor, tell them and they'll get the issue resolved.  Then head over to http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/complaints/index.html and file a complaint.  It's a civil rights violation to refuse a valid/on time prescription under the ADA.

"269","ADD is the older name of ADHD-pi and there's a spot of drama over the whole combining it all under ADHD because ADHD as a name implies to everyone hyperactivity and that's not great for people struggling with non-physical hyperactivity and being dismissed.

Both are used pretty much interchangeably talking to people, and a lot of doctors are [that Nick Fury clip](https://youtu.be/mOEr7kiysrE). But officially paperwork should say ADHD-PI.

Personally my un-doctory opinion is they should have made them all just attention deficit disorder followed by whatever subtype but ADHD has the name recognition so....

"274","Yes, this. I hear what you’re saying OP. I have a physical aversion bordering on pain sometimes when I start to do things I don’t want to do.

I have learned to trick myself by dividing my attention. This took some years to master. You must load your cognition enough to not overfocus on the crappy task but not distract yourself too much.

I do two things: listen to an audiobook and set a time limit. I say, ok, this will only take an hour. And I think about how happy I will be when that hour is done. 

Then, when I am cleaning, I focus on the immediate. Put everything away in its place. Clear out trash, wipe down surfaces. There has to be an order of operations.

It worked today. I started getting anxious, put on the audiobook “Get out of your own way” and cleaned my condo in an hour. It’s not a spotless deep clean but I feel great for doing it. ","dtcfoge",2,1517102187,"2018-01-28 01:16:27"
"275","I've been doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for over 11 years.  It's the best kind of exercise for me.  It is physically intense and mentally stimulating.  The obvious physical consequences of letting my mind wander (loss of blood supply to the brain and/or hyper-extension of joints) forces me to stay present and in the moment.  It's not like jogging or cycling where you ideally get your brain to turn off and go on autopilot.  Instead I'm constantly thinking and analyzing

What is my opponent doing?

What is he trying to do?

What do I need to do to prevent him from accomplishing his goals?

What is my attack from here?

etc

There is no email I forgot to send, or meeting tomorrow to plan for, there is only that moment in that roll.  When I'm on the mat is the time when my mind is the quietest.

And once you get some experience (probably a year or two) it can start become a great creative outlet.  So long as it doesn't break any rules (like say punching someone) you can just...*try* shit.  A lot of the time that random stuff doesn't work, but sometimes it works! And you're off to the races with some new technique.","eg13kkd",1,1549646550,"2019-02-08 17:22:30"

"279"," What I mean by coping mechanism is that in some ways you probably do things differently to compensate for your symptoms, consciously or not. In that, because you think differently you probably  did things differently (i.e. different study routine, ways to avoid distraction, hyperfocusing, etc.). However, at college those things were less effective or changed a bit due to the new study/ classroom environment at college versus high school and the like.

Until your doctor visit, you might want to try and mimic previous study, diet, etc habits or improve them. There's been a lot of posts on helpful apps here.

"288","similar thing here. 30mg. first time. slept 1 hour that night. Woke up at 4am and spent all night organizing my copic marker collection. Next day at work was tired but got thru it with a cup of coffee.

I have sorta found a solution. Works for me but might not work for you. But maybe it will? Can try.

I dont take it every single day. I take it every other day.

- Wake up stupid early. Like 3am early. Take your dose. Force yourself to struggle through just 1 hour until it kicks in (browse reddit or go for an early morning jog).

- After 1 hour it will kick in and then drink a cup of coffee and and im really REALLY awake and no longer sleepy even a tiny bit

- start working. Ill either work from home or arrive at the office hella early. Get a huuuge amount of stuff done

- keep awake until 10pm~midnight ish. Try to not fall asleep before that or even nap. resist urge to nap if you get a medication crash.

- finally I will be able to sleep! But it wont be for much. Probably 4 hours? Try and time this so that you wake up at REGULAR work time. Like wake up 8am and arrive to office at 9am

- work a normal day, no medication, just coffee

- sleep early like 5pm early. sleep 5pm-3am.

- repeat from step 1. OR can also add a third medication-less day with a good 8-10 hour sleep and THEN repeat from step 1 again.


Also this schedule allows me to have days off of vyvanse so that I dont rely on it and dont get too dependent on it.

More medication, like in your case, probably made your hyperfocused on some homework but also made you like a zombie.

It's impossibly frustrating to not be able to pay attention to what you know you need to. If you think your meds are right, you need to find a way to reduce the extraneous stimuli.

I used to think I might be a sociopath, because no matter how much I like someone, once I don’t see them, I don’t miss them.

Now, to clarify, once I see them again, and we hug or whatever, *then* I feel this “Oh, I’ve missed this” type of thing.
But during the absence? No.

With ADHD, something has to be in your face to be on the forefront of your mind. I have an electric drum kit. Literally forgot about it for about a year, because it was tucked away in a corner.

It’s why I tell anyone with ADHD: To do lists have to be in your face, one way or another. The items in your house that are important, or the things you want to do, they have to be super visible.

Want to draw or paint more? Put a canvass or supplies in a place where you will be reminded of it constantly. Need to vacuum today? Put the vacuum cleaner in the middle of the room before you leave. That sort of thing.

And with people, don’t beat yourself up about it. It’s not that we don’t care. Hell, I think folks with ADHD care a little too much. It’s just how out brains work. If you do want to think about a certain someone more, try having a picture of them on your desk, that might help.

But the not missing thing, I’ve heard it countless times.

I do feel it more when I visualise activities I’ve done with that person. Like, I don’t miss my ex at all, but sometimes, I would remember curling up to him in bed or on the couch. The more vivid I can paint the picture, the more I could feel the “missing”. But it takes actual effort.","gw5ttby",2,1619610574,"2021-04-28 11:49:34"

"344","Hey,

I was in the exact same position as you a few of months ago. 

I knew things haven't been right for a long time and had been struggling with depression, struggle focusing, forgetfulness, broken sleep, difficulty in relationships, impulsiveness, disorganisation, anxiety, struggling in work and did a bit of googling. I stumbled across ADHD and did lots of research. I convinced myself I had it and it was the root cause of my MH problems, and was keen to start medication hoping that would give me the boost I needed to start managing my symptoms and improve my life. 

Finally, light at the end of the tunnel.

I had an assessment about a month after raising concerns I had ADHD with my Psychiatrist (I am under a MH care team so I have good access to services, and my psychiatrist really listens and respects my POV). 

Nope.

I was told my symptoms were a part of my personality, and there was no medication that would help, a much harder pill to swallow imo. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a PD which I was aware of due to own research and the stigma attached. Apparently there is a crossover of symptoms between the two, a major difference is ADHD is prevalent from a young age and BPD tends to become pronounced early adulthood.

I am currently working with a psychologist to deal with some stuff, trying to make better life choices, getting into better habits, not be so sensitive, understand and control my emotions (which is harder said than done) and other things. I still really struggle with my relationships and my self worth. Through shear discipline and practise I have become more organized, however I still really struggle with adhering to a routine. My confidence and self worth fluctuates wildly, but things have definitely improved tenfold simply understanding myself and the different extremes of my personality, how this affects my day to day life and what my limits are.

Yes, I felt and looked like an absolute idiot for self diagnosing and being wrong, but all in all I'm really glad I did. It has given me clarity and it has been a learning curve. Recovery is a hard and long journey but you will get there, no matter what your diagnosis is (I consider my diagnosis as a starting block to improving my MH, my life and understanding myself a little better. In no way do I identify as it.)

What I'm trying to say is don't worry about 'looking a fool'. The real foolish thing to do would be not being open and honest about how you feel with the therapist and an ADHD or other diagnosis goes under the radar.

I was going to add the sentiment of focus on your symptoms, feelings, and problems rather than a diagnosis but I see others have already commented. Truth is in reality two people with the same diagnosis can experience things very differently and it can affect their life in completely different ways. Therapy with a good therapist is a blessing, use it to your advantage. 

Just my POV. 

Really hope this helps in some way. Fingers crossed for ya.","gw7pei9",1,1619640901,"2021-04-28 20:15:01"

I was only 6 years working and I felt it was too soon in my career not to have peers to talk to about work stuff. I still had a lot to learn. But the office I'm in now only has 5 ppl If everyone is in (two mostly work from home and one travels half the time). We have our real office in a different state so I do get to email others and talk on the phone. But fortunately for me, I am an introvert and the queen of hyperfocus so not having a lot of ppl physically around is fine by me. But it sounds like you need more ppl to bounce ideas off of and maybe this small environment isn't the best for you right now. What type of work do you do? Do you enjoy the actual work/industry?

Attitude is a big part of it! But I know that many times in the past at a job, I could not muster a good attitude if I tried. I get it in my head I don't like it and I bail. But you can look at this as temporary and learn everything you can and stick it out for a year. During that time you can spruce up your environment to make ur mood better. Just use this as a stepping stone to propel you to your next adventure. If there is a way to incorporate a learning/social aspect to your work that would be even better. Like a chat group in your line of work or take a training on something and stay involved in the community that uses it. Just some thoughts. Good luck with the plant! Got mine on Amazon.

I began to realize, as an adult, that I had ADHD all along, it’s just everyone has different symptoms and things they can’t focus on

My symptoms are:  procrastinating, struggle with getting to places on time, I can’t retain a lot of information and I am extremely forgetful, get overwhelmed easily, I have social anxiety (although, it’s improved as I got older), I will obsess over information I’m interested in and will research for hours sometimes days, I overthink, I dwell on things...the list goes on and on

Also,when I do chores etc, I have to listen to podcasts &amp; YouTube videos to stay motivated.  I get very bored with a lot of movies &amp; TV shows. There are only few I am interested in, and when I’m interested, I can sit through them and watch them.  I get bored with repetitive tasks and routine.  I HATE routine.  I even get bored with certain fitness/workout routines.  

My son has ADHD and while we have a lot of similarities, he differs from me in a lot of ways.  Example: he has the hyperactivity and hates reading (whereas I love reading),  he’s impulsive etc..

A few things that don’t seem to add up with me having ADHD:  I love love love to read.  I will sit and read about anything for hours.  I can read up to 3 or 4 books at the same time.  I’m calm and easy going (though, sometimes I can’t sit still), I’m not impulsive.  I have to think everything through before I make decisions.  I’m adventurous, but only to an extent lol..you won’t see me skydiving or anything.  

Anyways, I’m always learning something new about this disorder.   And I find it so fascinating, in a way, how everyone with ADHD can be so similar and relate, but yet be so different.

There is no test for ADHD.

Let me say that again. There is no test for ADHD.

If you go into a place and they are just giving you tests and use that to discern whether or not you have ADHD, then that place was a total waste of your time. Any ""ADHD test"" is subjective. This means the results of the same test can be interpreted differently depending on who is looking at them. A subjective test is objectively worthless.

The only way to really tell if somebody has ADHD is by observing them and talking with them about their symptoms.

So the only thing that matters, is do you think you have ADHD? Do you have too many similarities between yourself and the people of this sub to ignore the possibility? Do you think you would benefit from ADHD medication?

If so, then go get diagnosed. You might have to throw yourself at a handful of psychiatrists, but eventually one will say yes.

"388","I apologise completely if that is the impression you got from me. I'm in no way trying to say that your achievements mean nothing. That wasn't my goal at all, if anything it's the exact opposite.

Yes I think that ADHD is a bad thing, and has no redeeming qualities. But I don't think that you should be solely summed up as being a person with many other positive traits.

Of course people with ADHD can be successful, it's harder, because of what we have to deal with but it's not impossible or unachievable.

This post wasn't supposed to be a pity party, instead my goal is to say that those things that people often say are ADHD related shouldn't be and instead you should take credit for them yourself. Expanding the scope of ADHD and giving it extra positives can be damaging to those people who don't have those traits.

My goal was never to make you or anyone feel bad about having ADHD, but simply to say that misattributing good things to it can be damaging.","ehtyfwn",1,1551782172,"2019-03-05 10:36:12"

"390","Depends. Are you treating your ADHD in any way? 

It's pretty common for people's grades to drop about a point when they enter college-- the classes are structured differently, there's less external structure to lean on, and the material can be more challenging. Personally, I did best in the hardest, most engaging classes, but there just weren't enough of them to keep my GPA up. And you can get put on probation or expelled if your grades get too low for too long. Given where you're starting from, it could be an expensive gamble to try it without first getting more of a handle on the ADHD.  If you aren't using any treatment or management strategies, get on that stat and take a break year if you need it.

I couldn't do boring book based study, so I just did what I found fun and challenging. 

It used to only go to N4 and the original N4 got split into N4 and N5 and the original N3 made narrower as the original gap between N3 and N2 was pretty drastic. So it's better these days.

After finishing RTK in 6 months while doing immersion and sporadically picking up vocab, I actually I studied grammar for about 4 months straight (seriously just wasn't doing anything else with my life) with 2000 sentences in Anki based on a material called KO2001 and tried N2 after that. I got 50% I think which was a fail as I needed either 60 or 55 can't quite remember. But passed it 6 months later. 6 months after that I tried N1 and failed (by like a few points again) and tried again 6 months later and passed.

This experience of the name of a disorder not really matching the experience of the client seems so common to me - Borderline Personality Disorder, for example, is horribly named - it was given that name because at the time, clinicians were on the fence about whether it was a ""real"" disorder.

"427","Job hunting is not a quick process and can be very emotionally draining.  It's neither a fun or easy process to go through and even harder for someone with ADHD.  If you're currently unemployed then your job search is your new job.  I hear this a lot and it gets old, but the best way to get a new job is to treat finding a job as a job.  This means starting a routine where the you're looking full time for work, improving yourself and getting things done.  

It's best to start small: go look at sites or job boards, apply here and there, figure out what you need to work on, etc.  Just take things one step at a time until you get back into the swing of things.  The hardest part is finding motivation to just get started, but if you start small you've already made the first step as easy as possible.  

There are a few things you need to do: apply for jobs, work on things you can be better in or learning new things, and being generally productive overall.  Spend as much time applying for positions as possible.  If you see something that you can do, apply for it.  If you see something you want to do next, apply for it.  If you find something that you want to do but is a stretch, apply for it!  If you're sending resume's out you won't get rejected, you'll just find places that aren't good fits.  

What do you do when you've already applied for everything?  Well you have two options: practice or learn something new and relevant to your trade or go be generally productive.  If you're not working on finding a job then you're working on yourself.  What part of the interview process are you weakest in? What is something in your field that you've always wanted to learn? What is something you could be better at?  These are things to work on when you're not actively applying to places.  If you need a break from these things then there are other things you can do and feel good about.  Clean up around the house, fix things that need fixing, go run errands, take care of things that need to be done or that you've been putting off.  As long as you're doing something then you're going in the right direction.  

There was a post (and now subreddit) that had a similar idea for life about this: [no zero days](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/wiki/the_four_pillars).  As long as you do something, then you're doing the right thing.  It's hard, it sucks, it's not a fast process but it takes work and you can do it.  I'm going through something similar now and I know it sucks a lot.  As long as you keep it up and take one step at a time you'll be fine.  You can do it.

"428","tl;dr  If the only issue you have is concentration, medication can be a perfectly viable solution. Hopefully you're able to find a psychiatrist that fits your needs.

I think it's important to note that there exists conflicting schools of thought in psychology. For example, those that believe that anxiety causes ADHD vs those that view them as separate and unrelated issues. Research has shown that there is a degree of correlation, but this doesn't necessarily mean there is causation. There was even a study that proposed that ADHD is more of a culmination of several different conditions rather than its own condition. As we develop new technology to monitor brain functions, we may develop a better understanding of ADHD, although there is already plenty of amazing research available to help people.

There are different approaches to treatment such as CBT, Gestalt, DSM, exposure therapy, and medication. Not everyone learns the same methods, so you can't expect every therapist to have studied DSM V as if it's a requirement, just as many therapists specialize in certain topics such as couples therapy or children's issues. Like the other post mentioned, there are also different classifications such as counselor, therapist, psychologist, and psychiatrist with different levels of education and fields of study. All of these different names and specialties can be quite confusing for someone looking for treatment for the first time. I'm not sure how you're finding the therapists, but we have them listed online with details about their specialties, treatment methods, and educational background.

So yeah, this therapist is definitely not for you, but they were simply presenting their approach to therapy. They seemed like a more spiritual therapist that avoided medications, kind of like a holistic, natural approach to psychology, although I'm too unfamiliar with Gestalt to make an accurate assumption. Maybe this triggered your anger because it's not how you think therapy should be, as you mentioned ""pseudo-crap"" and seeking DSM-V. However, there are people that want to avoid medication and would be interested in that therapist's approach instead of more traditional methods. Some people have had bad experiences with medications as well, and they make more progress through different methods of treatment. Having a different approach and ideology to therapy does not make a therapist bad. We should be glad that multiple options for treatment exist.

I did see some bad therapists, but I didn't know until several sessions in. I was falsely diagnosed with mild autism and OCD, which was crazy thinking back to it. Those therapists tended to focus most of the sessions on testing and sharing life my experiences rather than developing applicable solutions. One of them was younger than me and in her first year out of college. It was easy to notice her inexperience and lack of knowledge compared to previous experiences. She was reciting basic information that sounded straight out of a textbook, and she was very nervous. She would repeat standard solutions that weren't working instead of analyzing my specific situation like other therapists did. Unfortunately, therapists have to start somewhere. I don't see therapists anymore, but I would definitely seek one out with more education and experience if I had to go back. There are also plenty of books and online content to manage yourself as well, like this subreddit.

It's important to find the right fit for what you're looking for. I personally tried many medications for depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and they all had little effect on my situation. Even on ADHD meds, I would get distracted. I had to work through many deeper issues, so I benefited the most while seeing a great CBT therapist that helped me develop better habits and a healthier perception of reality. I have a very pragmatic and analytical mind that worried about existentialism, so I needed a therapist with a very sharp mind for logic and philosophy. After completing the therapy, the ADHD medication became much more effective because I learned to manage my ADHD without the meds.","dsw0m1q",4,1516312409,"2018-01-18 21:53:29"

There was a three-pronged approach: meditation, skills and the actual CBT part of it (recognizing and replacing unhelpful thinking styles/patterns). The meditation didn't do much for me personally although I know it's great for others and would still recommend. The other two parts helped, but would have needed more time to practice stuff we learned, I retained and still use maybe 25% of what we learned. Would love to go back but am unable to because of school. I'd highly recommend it! Edit: I did it before being medicated cause I hadn't yet been referred to a doctor to try meds out at that point.

"445","Try rougelikes.  I've gotten to the point where almost all other games are just too boring.  The only games I really play anymore are Nethack, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and to a lesser extent angband and it's clones.  Best part about these games is that theres minimal story and they're randomly generated so it's a different game each time.  DCSS is great because it's extremely detailed in character creation.  Want to be an 8-legged Octopod assassin?  Do it!  Want to be a kobold chaos knight who worships an insane god that treats you like it's favorite plaything?  Anything goes!  

Nethack is my go-to.  I've been playing it on and off for almost 15 years.  It could probably run on a toaster and it's still an amazing game.  The devs pretty much thought of everything, giving you the ability to produce a reaction for almost any action you do (polymorphing into any creature in the game, using monster abilities like walking through walls or laying eggs as dragons that hatch into pets, eating metallic objects like rings to gain their stat boosts permanently)  It's incredibly satisfying.

You can also get all of these games on your cellphone so you can play them anywhere.  Angband and Rougelike Classics are awesome apps and Rougelike Classics has just about all of the angband clones but has a difficult interface to use extensively.

This is why stimulants like adderall are effective because stimulants release a lot of dopamine which allows you to stay focused on homework and things you wouldn’t be able to focus on otherwise. Things like watching porn too much,taking too much adderall, or not getting enough sleep con contribute to dopamine depletion which is when your brain has a lack of dopamine and is struggling to make more. When I had this, it was from being on 30mg adderall XR and when I went back down to 20mg adderall XR the issue was fixed. The problem is that I had the EXACT same symptoms as depression while this was going on. Most people don’t mention this because they don’t take into account the adderall being taken.

"506","Yeah, I totally understand the practical barriers and they can be really annoying. But also, honestly, it's not their brain or their life, it's yours! My parents were pretty anti-psychiatry and anti-therapy and it took me until I was in my mid-20s to go to therapy for the first time -- afterwards I wished that I had gone when I was a teenager because it could have helped so much. You might have to shop around a little but I highly recommend therapy, *particularly* for what you're talking about (wanting someone to listen instead of label).

I haven't used it but some people seem to like ZocDoc for automatically booking doctors that are in-network with your insurance. (A lot of insurance also covers out-of-network but you might have to pay in full until you meet the deductible, which I'm guessing wouldn't work as well for you.) You can also ask potential therapists about your specific financial/insurance situation since they probably have better info about that.","dhc5s1h",2,1494351838,"2017-05-09 17:43:58"

The feel of the steering wheel in my hands.
The response of the accelerator pedal.
The click on the blinker.
The roll of the car on the corners. 

I started to feel very connected with the car. I stopped worrying about the actual drive itself and started focusing on how amazing it feels to be controlling a 1 1/2 ton missile.

"528","My Grammar/Middle School had two programs outside of the normal curriculum: Trailer, for the kids who were slow and needed extra help with Math and/or Reading, and Kaleidoscope, for the kids who were more advanced at Math and/or Reading (don't get me started on the names - this was the 90s and things were not PC).  When I was a kid, the school suggested that I be placed in Trailer for math.  They thought I should be tested for a learning disability.  Instead of getting me tested, my parents got my aunt, a 1st grade teacher at a Montessori school, to sit with me for a few hours, do some activities, and give her recommendation.  She told them that I wasn't disabled, I just wasn't interested in some things.  If something didn't interest me, I would rather just retreat into my own world and play by myself.  So I didn't have to go to Trailer, and by the time I was in 6th grade, I qualified for Kaleidoscope in Reading.  

Now, I know that this was just the way my ADHD manifested.  I do wonder how things would have turned out if my parents had gotten me tested.  Would they have caught the ADHD?  Or would I have just been labelled as slow?  In some ways, I think they did me a disservice by refusing to believe that anything could be wrong with me.  On the other hand, if I had been labelled as slow, my education would have been vastly different and probably not that great.  I have mixed feelings about the whole thing.","d90cp1z",2,1476975215,"2016-10-20 14:53:35"

As much as ADHD sucks, I don't think it's the worst condition you can have (or even the worst mental disorder) by almost any measure. If I remember correctly, around  90% of people with ADHD will respond to at least one drug or drug combination. Most other mental disorders have a lower response rate than this, and some (like dyslexia) don't have any medical treatment at all. ","cmr1xh1",3,1418240544,"2014-12-10 19:42:24"

While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

If ADHD was being prone to distractions alone, I think we’d all have found a permanent solution by now. But its so much deeper and so much more intricate and different from person to person depending on their brain chemistry.

"566","I work with kids (a few w/ ADHD) and what I like to do when they get overly emotional (usually upset or angry): Instead of yelling (which would be much easier sometimes), I tell them they need to calm down so we can talk nicely because a. They're yelling or b. They're crying and no one can understand anything being said. If necessary, I make them sit somewhere to cool off (I let them know they're not on time out ie. In trouble) and periodically check in to see if they're ready to talk. 
If they aren't able to control themselves, getting them away from all the stimulus/triggers helps. For a specific kid with ADHD and anger issues, we've set up a system where he can physically remove himself from the area to a safe space if he feels he can't control himself. Getting him to this point and the ability to recognize when he needs to leave was not easy (and is still a work in progress). I had to break up lots of fights before but now I can ask him if he needs to leave if I see it coming. 

When they're ready, I ask them a bunch of questions; what happened, why did it happen, was that appropriate/nice or why do you think they responded in that way. Once they understand the situation, I transition into the consequences.

This is pretty much what my parents did to me. If they yelled, I'd just yell louder. If they told me to sit in time out, I'd resist or say I don't care and it won't do anything. I knew all their buttons and I pushed them. They learned early on that I needed the buffer time and so did they. I still pressed buttons but the situations were way less tense after they figured out how to discipline me more effectively. Albeit, I still got away with lots of stuff cause they had to pick their battles. I would've turned out terrible if they had just kept yelling though. Bless them.

Here is some science. [Essentially, the more severe the ADHD, the more severe the sleep issues.](http://www.sleep-journal.com/article/S1389-9457(14)00259-7/abstract))

[The NIH on the interaction between sleep and ADHD. ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2687494/)

More NIH: [kids with ADHD have later sleep onset.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16076654)

Here's some [lay person style into to sleep initiation.](http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/757.html)

I have real troubles with sleep initiation.  I find that it's often caused by either taking my meds too late in the morning, or watching stuff on TV that is too stimulating/exciting, or watching computer/phone too much.  A psychological contributor may be that in us ADHD folks we feel guilty about what we didn't get done that day, and so we feel compelled to work late into the night, exacerbating the sleep, which exacerbates our symptoms. 

Another factor for me personally (and this can happen to non ADHD people too) was that when ADHD made it hard to get stuff done at work that day, I felt compelled to work late, and thus had no time to myself at night.  On those nights I'd say things to myself like ""you've earned time to read/surf pinterest/tweet."" 

I often feel like sleep is a punishment.  

But once I got a handle on all of this, I realized that sleep is my most important friend. If I'm not sleeping right the meds don't work as well. Also decreased sleep drives appetite. 

In my hierarchy, sleep comes before everything else but air and water. Before family, friends, and exercise.  

To help with my sleep initiatiion issues I do the following:

* no phone/tv after 8:30pm (which is when I walk my dog, a nice trigger to be outside and getting dark)
* strict bedtime: in bed 9:30, lights out between 10-10:30. 
* strict awake time: 6-6:30am. I can push this to 7 but much later and i""m bumping up against a late meds start and that screws everything up.
* eat, exercise, work at same times.  
* quit work on time by 6pm most nights.  I'd say 1-2 nights in 10 I work later, but I choose to do so and usually i'm borrowing from the next night, i.e. I might stop working at 4pm the next night.  This is so I can have ME time, unstructured, do whatever I want fuck around time so I'm not so resentful when it's time to go to sleep at 9:30. 
* I find minor sounds and lights at night to really screw with my ability to sleep so I started wearing ear plugs and an eye mask and these help enormously.  I just have to conjure up motivation to put them on, not to actually go to sleep. So it feels less difficult to me.  

It's a constant battle.  Constant.  I have to every damn day work on this.  otherwise I drift....and it's ugly...

I hope this helps. ","csc8stu",2,1434745749,"2015-06-19 20:29:09"

"586","I experienced many years of misdiagnosis too. 

I think the best defense against a doctor that has a bias against or isn't looking for ADHD is learning to say the right things in the right way. This NOT about manipulation to get a diagnosis, this is about presenting a measured, non-threatening (to the doc's professional ego), request for TESTING. 

- Don't tell the doctor you don't have the other diagnosis (depression) or that you are refusing treatment for it. Your argument needs to be that it is not the whole picture and that existing treatment is insufficient. And people here are correct, you may be depressed as well, but I also agree that any depressive symptoms seem to stem from ADHD type problems. This doesn't mean the depression isn't real or shouldn't be treated, but it does mean it can subside a lot once the ADHD symptoms are reduced directly.

- Make it 100% clear that you are asking for proper testing, not an immediate diagnosis and script. Show that you are prepared to accept a negative result (even if you are not) because you respect that it is really hard for a doctor to quantify &amp; verify the self-reported inner workings of your brain.

- You probably know that Dr. Barkley's way of thinking about &amp; understanding ADHD is not entirely alligned with the mainstream, DSM-IV (or earlier) framework that most doctors were trained in years ago. (I personally love his work.)  The recent DSM-V didn't make a whole lot of changes. I can't speak to specifics off the top of my head, but if you've cited criteria or ways of thinking about ADHD that he uses but don't exist in the DSM, you may have come across as ""fringe"" in your thinking. 

Psych doctors must build up this callus against their patients bringing in crackpot theories. If a patient wants validation of their position that ""It's not schizophrenia, the fluoride in my water reacts with the gluten in my bread! I don't need drugs anymore, I just changed my diet!"" they can find something somewhere to back them up. But this tends to create rigid thinking if the doctor overcompensates, and it hurts patients like you and me that might live in the murky world of ""atypical presentation.""  If your doctor is already in the ""Barkley is an idiot"" camp, I don't know if any related damage can be undone.

I was on antidepressants for about 8 years, started Adderall about 3 years into that, and after some really crucial social life improvements &amp; years of therapy I confidently stopped the antidepressants. I probably could have stopped them sooner, but I also really needed them at first.  If I had been properly diagnosed as a kid, I don't think the antidepressants would have ever been necessary.

Your right that I should take some time to acknowledge the aspects of teaching that I enjoy. In addition I think for me I'm just in a time of hardship at the moment that once everything get's sorted out will get better. 

I think part of it too was that I thought I was beyond my ADHD/executive functiioning and that I didn't need to put the things in place like laying out my clothes for the morning, reminders to clean my room, and preparing my lunch before for the next day. I think through talking with my parents and admiting about my lateness I have a better understanding that it will always follow me. As such working on doing things to make my mornings more streamlined will be key. 

I suppose too that being in an elementry school is a different environment, seemingly having to be overly positive. I think I myself struggled with that aspect as I feel working with older kids is more with my personality. 

Maybe it might be something where I find a smaller school or even a Catholic school to really get my bearings. Sure the public school pay is fantastic where I live but maybe I need to cut my teeth in another school system first to gain experience. 

I'd be curious if my employer would give me certain accomidations, something to look at for sure. 

 Ifully agree that I don't want to limit myself due to what I think about my cognative abilities. Lately I've been on a early wake-up kick and it's been really good for me. I'm getting to bed at a reasonable hour and find myself waking up by 6am or earlier which is better then previously struggling to get out of bed.

"608","**TLDR:** We have multiple brain networks that work as a team. Each brain network does certain things for it is designed to do certain things.  A network tied to mind wandering, introspection, but also for looking for things that are unconnected to the main goal is overactive in ADHD.  The name of this network is called the Default Mode Network.  The Default Mode Network is an automatic brain network, it works without you thinking doing so automatically.  It is kinda between the conscious mind and the unconscious mind for you can think about it, but it works automatically / implicitly and you can't really stop it.

The default mode network is a corner of a 3 corner triangle.  Two of the other major corners are the Central Executive / Frontal Parietal Control Network / Task Positive Network with all of those words meaning the same.  The 3rd corner is the Emotional Saliency Network.

Non TLDR but with pictures

#[See this Picture](http://img.medicalxpress.com/newman/csz/news/800/2013/brainsflexib.jpg)

and here is the study it comes from, you can read this later [please finish my post](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758404/).  Do note that the names in the first picture vs second picture are different.  The first picture is directed at the common public since it was part of a news release, the second picture inside the study is using the names you see in the scientific literature.

The network labeled Flexible Hubs FPN is also known as the  Frontal Parietal Network, The Executive Function Network, or the Task Positive Network depending on the paper you are reading

The network labeled Salience is also known as the Emotional Salience Network, Attentional Control is known as the Dorsal Attention Network, Attention is known as the Ventral Attention, Stable Task Control is also known as Cingulo-Opercular Network, Subcortical is things like the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum, Motor is you actually planning out the motor movements, Visual and Auditory are your various senses.

**Every single network on that graph is an attention network**, but they are different types of attention networks, and they work together as a team. Some of them are more

* **control type networks for your attention** like staying on a task, or making sure your actions further some larger goal or your interest in general,

* some are more evaluative and processing of stimuli in your attention, is this important or is this not, did I make a mistake with my last action or did I do a good thing, 

* and some of them are more automatic and incorporating new details into your mental mind space.  This is new, is it important or is it not.  This changed lets add this to both my temporary information, but also my long term memory where I tell a story a narrative and incorporate the bigger picture.

Your brain has some of them active almost all the time, but 3 of the networks your brain shifts where you have the Frontal Parietal / Central Executive Network heavily active, or you have the Default Mode Network heavily active, or roughly 50/50 or a percent inbetween.  The Emotional Salience Network is the Network that determines which of those 2 networks should be active and at how much.

Effectively the emotional saliency network is the big switch that switches between whether you are mind wandering or paying attention to your environment and being off track of your goal, and whether you are in your hyperfocus / goal directed mode.

Now the default mode has many many important things and it is not just a time waster.  The default mode works with the frontal parietal mode to establish creativity, the default mode is the sense of insight of unconnected things, the light bulb going off.  Yet it only does this when your default mode and frontal parietal are about 50/50.  Also the default mode is the brain network that creates your own internal sense of self that is not  ""resume based"" while the ""frontal parietal"" is more the resume sense of self.  The default mode is also the brain network that tells your brain that you are making progress to your goals and get excited, or you are going to get discouraged for you are not making progress thus lets do something that gives us instant rewards or is shiney.  The default mode network is also connected to our sense of resilience with it working correctly we are confident and cocky with it not working correctly we are anxious or depressed.

Many disorders not jut ADHD have problems with these 3 corners of a control triangle.

"609","I’m 20 with pretty severe adhd and just moved out, I’ve had quite the strained relationship with my mom over the years. When I was your sons age, there wasn’t a conversation had that didn’t enter into a screaming match, and with me forcibly leaving the house and seeking solace in substance abuse, terrible friends, and vulgar hip hop music. 

My biggest recommendation to you would be, to try and talk to him like he’s your friend. You have to show real interest in whatever it is rather than concern, and open up the bigger picture, even though it may be warranted from your end. 

If you have any sort of agenda, ie. if you start talking to him about other random non important things with the intention of bringing up the important thing it won’t work. You can also never just bring it up in a directly confrontational way, it’s extremely touchy but there’s a middle ground right there somewhere....

We’re highly sensitive to all perceptions and behaviors towards us, while we can really enjoy attention and want to be the center of it, we absolutely hate it in certain ways. So; if we have something on our minds we KNOW we need to do and aren’t doing it for whatever reason, and someone else brings that up, it’s a sensation of being totally overwhelmed and we simply can’t deal with it no matter how important. The mind either goes directly into fetal position or boxing mode.

Whenever my mom wants to bring up something or have a conversation about something real and important, I really know it’s coming from a good place, but I absolutely can’t stand any sort of concern for my own well-being that isn’t my own because it makes me feel inadequate when I’m doing my absolute best and know what I want, then I spiral into misdirected hate, anger, and rage. Then that just makes me feel worse about myself, it’s definitely circumstantial and not so black &amp; white. 

However, when a friend brings up something like that I will actually enjoy it and be interested, as long as where they’re coming from is curiosity, rather than concern. Simply if it’s brought up in a nonchalant manner rather than a directive confrontational one will determine his response. 

As other symptoms begin too naturally heal it will inevitably get better. How they’re healed is very up to the individual, and very specific however, really takes time and patience.

Studies have shown that sleep helps you retain information better anyway - if you study for an extra three hours it's pointless if you wake up the next day and can't remember most of it, plus you'll be tired with nothing to show for it.

Study to a semi-reasonable hour, try to understand a FEW points really well instead of a LOT of information partially, wake up early and review what you learned the night before, and take the test with a decent night's sleep.

"634","The problem with ADHD is that it's a disorder, not a *disease* as such. It's (as far as I understand) not something you ""have"" or ""don't have"", it's a reduced/delayed development of some functions in the brain.

Everyone has a different level of how well they function in these areas, and in everyone they fail from time to time.

It is when it works so badly (compared to the mean) that you feel major impairments in several aspects of your life that this natural variation becomes a disorder.

That's the problem: everyone knows how it feels to lose focus or control *sometimes*, but they don't understand how quality of life is reduced when it happens more often and with important things.

You could try telling your friends and family that and make them understand that - whatever they're saying - the fact is that *you* are feeling impaired from the symptoms.","crxdue7",15,1433581445,"2015-06-06 09:04:05"

There really is no safe, easy way to get the ""buzz"" every time. You're either going to have to take frequent ""med vacations"" (which is impractical) or continue increasing your dose (which will also increase the drug's side effects.) 

The ""buzz"" is only one effect that your meds have. The other effects - like increased ability to focus, self-regulate, etc. - generally *don't* diminish over time. This is because your body only builds a selective tolerance to your medication (and actually, this is true of most drugs.

"675","If the doctor you're talking about here is your GP, you probably need to ask for a referral to a psychiatrist. If you already have a psychiatrist, you can ask them about it. My first psychiatrist (in school) basically said, ""Well, it sounds like you have ADD symptoms, but you also *definitely* have depression symptoms, so let's treat the depression and see if it helps with the attention stuff."" So I tried that, and then the depression rolled more into anxiety, so I tried anxiety medications, and then recently I got a new psychiatrist and asked if we could revisit the ADD thing. I talked to him for a little bit, and he said, Yep, that sure sounds like ADD to me, so now I'm trying an ADD med (instead of a depression med that is sometimes used off-label for ADD). In terms of diagnosis, it probably doesn't help that I am functional like 90% of the time, so for me mental health is rarely a crisis and more, ""I guess I mostly feel okay but I also think I could be doing a lot better,"" which makes the lines a little fuzzy.

Check on your insurance website for behavioral health. I think some providers now have ADD-specific help for adults, but I just called the behavioral health line, specifically told them I wanted to talk to someone about maybe having ADD, and they made me an appointment with a doctor who deals with that (as opposed to, say, agoraphobia).

I try to get all my calories by night time when bit of my appetite comes back. T_T I think I’m losing more muscle mass than fat mass at the moment. 

I weighed myself this morning and I was bit shocked at the number. Recently seen few ppl I haven’t seen in awhile and they told me I look a lot thinner. I see myself everyday and I don’t feel like I “lost” a significant amount but... I am starting to notice it now. 

I do want to get to my goal weight... but I just hope that it stops once I am there.","fg0q32d",1,1580412807,"2020-01-30 19:33:27"

Maybe that false sense of urgency may sort hygiene and appearance. Lol.. I do had a little humour but yes this plays on my mind and mood.

It's all about breaking it down into smaller chunks that make sense by them selves, then stacking them up into a more complex idea. The book is structured this way, your notes, and work flow should be too.

Often, for me, the hardest part is getting started. I like writing the headings down because it's easy as beans, and it gives me a mental road map of what's coming up next... I sorta know what the chunks are going to be before I even get there.","gawa219",1,1604325900,"2020-11-02 14:05:00"

"710","The talking at you will never end, so forgive yourself for zoning out. My daughter is 14, and I have to snap back to attention many times. She’s old enough to learn how to conduct a conversation, and I expect good results by 2039. In the meantime, when I snap to, I try to ask a question or make a comment showing I was listening (they don’t have to know how badly.) But kids do drone on. I try to repeat what they said in my head, as much as I can, then I’ll at least have a slightly better memory for what they said. 

Small kids = stress for everybody. Without the stress now (or significantly less) my husband simply says something kind, like, “Paging Mom! Earth to Mom!” 

Full disclosure: I divorced their dad, because of his judgement. I think I was far down a different road than you are. 

It’s a sign that you’re wife is S.T.R.E.S.S.E.D. (I really mean that because it was a bitch to type out in my phone.) You need to wind her down, make her feel like she is heard because *you will get nowhere* without it. 

But you have a lot of trouble yourself, and she needs to be your ally. She needs to do something kind, like, “Snap out of it, Papa,” and *then* she needs to (CW CAPS!) STEP BACK AND LET YOU FIX YOUR MISTAKES. She is not helping anyone—not her, not you—by doing what she wanted you to do instead. 

You need to listen to her stress. Trust me on my authority as a Mom, that what she feels is 1000x greater than what she expresses (I know! That’s already a lot!) Then she needs to show some kindness to you and your struggles, then not step in where she wishes you would.","gfgov5k",1,1607731664,"2020-12-12 00:07:44"

I could probably look back and point out a million things that I wish my parents would have done differently. But what's the point in that? If everything was perfect, how would I ever know how to deal with hardships? Maybe I hated going out of my comfort zone, if I were left to my own vices I would have probably never left.

I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, but my parents style of raising for the most part nurtured me appropriately as if I were diagnosed IMO.

"751","You will always be at some relative disadvantage due to ADHD. The key is the word relative. A person of average intelligence is disadvantaged compared to one of above average intelligence, but we wouldn't say they're screwed or anything. 

Our brains, like all brains, improve with practice. What is likely is that we will always do more poorly when it comes to the general sphere of working memory and other areas affected by ADHD. 

However, like everyone else, we improve at specific tasks with practice. Think of it as partitioning off an area of your brain that is dedicated to some thing you're doing often, and therefore partially bypasses the general areas of your brain that are affected by ADHD (but only partially, of course). 

So, you can learn how to play bridge well. Don't panic. ;) 

Anecdotally, I find that my working memory improves for specific tasks that I'm familiar with. I still can't remember-to-remember my appointments, no matter how many times I go to one, but I can remember and add point values for something like bridge much better over time spent playing. (I don't actually play bridge.) 

**On medication:** the answer is yes, albeit indirectly. 

Your working memory can only hold a certain number of objects at once (that's true for everyone).

In ADHD, it's often the case that our working memory *capacity* is normal, it's just that we have difficulty keeping unrelated information from bumping other things out of our working memory. 

This same problem is also true in terms of processing speed, because our processing *speed* is often normal, it's just we have to process lots of extra operations to make up for all the times we have to go back and redo things in our heads (like you having to start over adding cards), or accidentally waste processing time on other things when we don't mean to. 

So yes, generally speaking, you should expect medication to improve your memory and speed of thinking, because your problem with those things is really a problem with focus-- a problem with focus that is indirectly reflected by poor scores in those areas. 

Once you focus better, you don't accidentally drop things from your working memory as much, and you won't have to go back and ""redo"" those things nearly as often. 

**Finally, on what you can reasonably expect:**

I think you're asking the wrong question here. 

Your ability in certain areas will *always* remain impaired. ADHD is not curable. You will always struggle to some extent with things other people seem to do easily. 

That said, your ability may always suffer, but your *performance* doesn't have to. You can't fix it, but you can band-aid it in addition to developing workarounds. 

Try to figure out how to reframe your problems. Most of them have more than one solution, so try to figure out how you can solve it via things you do well vs things you don't do well. 

Lastly-- even if you're always sub-average, even with medication, is that necessarily a reason to forgo it? Being mildly depressed is ""sub-average"", but if I was severely depressed I'd love to jump do high I could tag that mild depression rung. 

Similarly, in my personal experience, I still suck at some things even though I'm medicated. But I suck less, so much less that it's worth it to me. 

Hope that helps! 

**P.S.** That beginning, OP! LOL!  ""So I have this primary story but first I need to tell some other stories..."" So ADHD. xD","cjzszi5",3,1408952837,"2014-08-25 07:47:17"
"752","There are ways to alleviate that stuff. My phone has a hard case (two pieces: hard plastic under thick rubber) and a screen cover. Do you know how often I've dropped my phone? There is not a scratch on it.

What you need to do is developer a routine. We bought a key hanger since I kept losing my keys. First thing when I get home is I hang up my keys and my glasses (not the best spot for them but i never lose them). My jacket goes in one of four places. My shoes go in one of four places. Everything important goes in specific spots so that I dont have to worry about where something is.

I used to carry a purse everywhere and would lose things constantly. Now I dont usually take my purse anywhere except work. I have a wallet that is always in my jacket pocket.

It's not foolproof but it definitely helps. I'm not as crazy in the morning as I used to be. And I always check that I have at least the bare necessities before I leave. And I put that down to four: keys, wallet, phone, glasses. The thing I need to work on now is keeping up with chores but that's a whole other battle.","edkpxxj",1,1546971161,"2019-01-08 18:12:41"
"753","Thank you for such a thorough reply! There is a lot here that I can use as starting points for myself.

Currently trying to find a way to keep myself organized and you are the second person to recommend alarms, so it is definitely something I need to try out! I also really like the easy goals first idea, which I suppose I have been doing by accident  as I usually get my household chores done first  before tackling school work.  

I also need to be kinder to myself, as you said. When the meds start wearing off and I know that I can no longer concentrate as well, I usually get mad at myself for having X amount of work left that could have been done if I didn't waste any time. (Note: I'm not saying that I NEED the meds to do work, but as I said, I start getting hyper (or depressed) during the come down so there isn't anything productive happening until that stops and at that point I just want to relax until bedtime).  I'll start trying to focus on the work that did get completed instead.

I have such a bad relationship with sleep. If I had it my way I would stay up til 2-3 in the morning every night and wake up at 10-11. That is the only way that I can fall asleep and feel well rested. Trying to sleep before then and I just won't be able to fall asleep and waking up I won't feel rested in the slightest.

"791","I'm entering my senior year of undergrad. I'm majoring in English and secondary education so I can teach English at the high school level. I was originally going to college to be an elementary school teacher, but my skills really lie with English and I realized that I *much* rather prefer working with older students.

It's a lot more work than many expect. Definitely very stimulating. Studying to become a teacher opened my eyes to how underappreciated teachers are, and it sucks, but for some reason I'm still here and eager to graduate and hopefully find a full time teaching job.

I like this major because it allows me to actually get a job related to English lit/writing, lol. Granted, I know the pay won't be so hot but it'll be better than what my family is taking in as an income right now, so I have no qualms with the pay (although the pay teachers receive is very disproportionate to the work that teachers actually do.)

I have no idea if my ADHD influenced my choice in major. While I currently feel as though this is a great fit for me, I know that little 18 year old me during my senior year of high school picked teaching because in the back of my head I felt as though I sucked at everything, had no idea what I liked or was interested in (because my interests would constantly change, and they were generally things that had nothing to do with skills), and teaching was familiar to me, so I had a lesser chance of failing.

While I'm enjoying the major and all of my peers in it are some of the greatest people I've ever met, this major has seriously challenged my self-confidence, albeit I believe it to be for the better. It's hard to get in front of people not much younger than you and teach them, when you yourself are still learning. Not to mention, there are people I've met who are *born* to teach, and they make me feel like I'm going to be a sucky one! :) Hopefully teaching truly is a fit for me, but I'll only know once I begin student teaching next semester, or when I find a full-time job after graduating!","dmejy7o",1,1504226819,"2017-09-01 00:46:59"

"795","It‘s really hard for us to focus and takes a lot of energy, but that‘s difficult to understand for neurotypical people (that is: people who's brains are more ‘typical‘). Just 'focusing' will not do it for us, because you do it with your brain and our brains really love to be unfocused and entertained by every noise and thought. Instead of simple thoughts we're herding a two litters of kittens in our heads and they are all cute and want to play.  
You'll need to get special training or at least train yourself for a while to overcome this.  

When I was of your age, nobody knew about ADHD. When in 4th grade I remember eating concentrated spices because I hoped they would help me to concentrate. So I remember the despair. But during the decades I learned to work around myself and I think for some of us the goal should not be to be ""normal"" but ""functioning in our own way and happy"".  

For this I tried to understand how my brain works and how myself in this second can help myself in 15 minutes.

I'm expecting to find myself *fidgeting*, so I always have a few *silicone makeup sponges* in my pockets and everywhere. They work very well for me and they are silent. I have a lot of tiny magnets to put cards ion whiteboards for my job, they are *great* for fidgeting, but loud. Only opening and closing the case of Apple Airpods is more annoying (but sooo satisfying).
So I switched to those sponges. Try different things. Fidgeting is okay and has been proven to even help neurotypical people with focussing.  

I started *sketchnoting* many years ago. It's basically a socially accepted way of doodling, doodling is close to fidgeting and helps me focus. However, people really like my notes.   

My feeling of *time* is completely off, especially without medication. I think that this makes my brain very bored in a short time of ""focussing"". But I have a smartwatch (old Apple watch) and when I really need to focus I set it to *silently buzz me every 10 minutes* or so with a regular timer. Somehow this interruption tells my brain that only 10 minutes have passed and not a century and somehow it keeps me on the right track. It's an external impulse that does not rely on my brain to do something at the right time.  
(There are other, similar methods, named ""Pomodoro"", using intervals of work and relaxation, but I found that my main problem was the perception of time and reminding myself to go back on track.)

*Silence.* Everything I hear or see is more interesting for my brain than what I'm currently doing. So I always have *noise canceling headphones* near me and simple *foam earplugs* (Moldex spark plugs, a pack with 200 lasts for a while...) are in every pocket and bag.  
The earplugs saved me through many many tests. You'll likely not be wearing them in class to mute the teacher, but when you have to do something in silence they may help :-)

Food and caffeine. Since taking medication (Vyvanse) I really can't have caffeine in the morning but need a proper breakfast for the medication to be really helpful. However: when the medication is wearing off, taking a (quiet) break with a single, good cup of coffee really softens the ""crash"". So depending of your age and culture you're in, that may help. 

I try to find ways to reach my goals and not to force myself to stumble the ways of other people to those goals. You know that you have ADHD and you seem smart, so I think the key is to understand (and love) yourself.

Perhaps have them write a letter?

Other than that, I don't know what's available in terms of meds in your country, but vyvanse for example is also prescribed for binge-eating. Methylphenidate is indicated for insomnia or something like that iirc. It might be an option - as a last resort - to just research another illness and then lie and hope for the best.

And iirc there has been at least one study that has shown saffron extract to work comparably to methylphenidate in kids with ADHD, it was linked on this sub and my first reaction was ""oh now way"", but it was an actual real study.

"841","I have been feeling like this plenty of times as well, as I am sure many others here have. You are not alone! Not that that will solve much, but it can be a little comforting to at least know that.

First thing I will say: get an appointment with a psychologist or psychiatrist, and get back on medication if you can! Don't slide into depression further, it sounds like you need help *now*. There are ways out of there, no matter how bleak the situation might look to you now. Don't give up! Explore what medication options there are; it might well be that a different kind of medication than what you took in elementary school will help you a lot more. Being medicated can be a great help with picking up your life agan bit by bit. It is not a magical cure, but it helps to get things done. Apart from medication, a professional can also help you a lot in learning to manage all the things you have difficulty with at the moment. I did cognitive therapy myself, which helped me gain a lot of insight in why I do and feel the things I do. This helps me to evaluate my past and future actions and to try and steer them towards longer term goals.

Another thing you can do, is try and evaluate the good and bad things about your ADD. Embrace the good things and love them! (for example, many mention having a creative, fast mind and loads of interests) Then think about the bad things you want to change, and how much of that is realistic. I used to feel a lot like you do now because I thought I had to be 'normal' like everybody else. Keep my house clean all the time, pay my bills on time, conform to how everyone else maintains social contacts.. After a while I realised, this was simply not realistic for me. I can't do those things in the way everybody else seems to be doing it like it takes no effort at all. When I kept trying to do that, it felt like I had to climb Mount Everest every damn day, only to end back down the hill again the next day. It is super fucking tiring and demotivating to live like that. And I don't want to do it anymore, fuck that shit. So I decided to try and figure out a way to live on my own terms and care less of what (I thought) everybody else thinks about it. Just deciding this gave me SO much peace of mind. I don't beat myself up anymore when I don't make a deadline for work, and I try not to feel guilty when I ask my family for help yet again. I *need* that help. It helps to admit that to yourself and work on feeling less of a burden to the people that help you. It also helps to see ADD as a condition that makes a lot of things that are simple for most people, very hard for us. This is not using ADD as a excuse when you failed a task. It is simply looking at it realistically, and knowing yourself. Don't let other people give you shit about that either.

Take small steps. Try to be proud of yourself for small victories. This can mean something simple like just calling up that friend after months, or managing to do the dishes one day. Even if it is the only thing you did that day, you still did it!! And for us these small steps can be a huge deal. Work from there. Don't beat yourself up! 

Good luck to you, and I hope you keep coming back here when you need support. It helps to know and read about people that go through the same things, and apart from the good advice here there are also plenty of shoulders to lean on when you need!","cb4f1mc",1,1374060200,"2013-07-17 11:23:20"

My blood work was on the top line where the gradient to renal failure begins. I would write that off as just a one-off thing, but it's obvious I needed to stop.

My grandfather drank 3 pots of coffee a day until it gave him a heart attack. Caffeine is fine, but I had an addiction.

I thought NSAIDs were generally dumb until I discovered Naproxen Sodium. It legitimately relieves headaches caused by tension, exhaustion, and sinus pressure for me. At least it does combined with some breath &amp; muscle control. They're a common overdose risk. For years I basically used ibuprofen for no reason at all (without results) at the suggestion of my parents in ignorance of the dangers. 

The thing about Acetaminophen is that just because you don't actually cause *noticeable* damage to your liver drinking alcohol after it, doesn't mean acute damage can't still be done by lingering metabolites. So again, safe but generally unhealthy. It would be an interesting question to ask a doctor, I suspect they'd tell us to keep them as far apart as possible for good measure.

I remember all the interesting details about him, but I could not hold onto his name for the life of me.  He was pretty good natured about it, he'd give me grief and then we'd go back to our legendary beer pong pairing.

The problem was I still couldn't remember his name after more than 6 months...he eventually started taking it personally.  I think I had some kind of mental block...but it broke up the team.  My game has never been the same.","e4ii842",7,1534769158,"2018-08-20 12:45:58"

I was recently diagnosed (last summer) and I dropped out of college after three semesters in 2004, having struggled with the format of higher education. Having been through treatment post diagnosis has helped me develop skills and habits that would have made college better/tolerable, and has made work much easier.

Skipping college was the right call for me—I found interesting work that has blossomed into a pretty rewarding career (IT/Sales Engineering), and don’t regret skipping. The social aspect of college may have been fun but overall I found starting my career earlier was better aligned with my personality.","fdf9e7v",1,1578356372,"2020-01-07 00:19:32"

"889","Need to impress everybody.  
Thinking what people think of me.  
Sensitive to criticism.  
Feeling of rejection if I don't get reply to a message.  
Constant feel of inferiority.  
Avoidance of many social situations where are people who matter to me, or whom I need to impress, so they don't see how low I am in life, and thus preventing any social rejection.  
Constant feeling of need to excel in some areas to gain social status, and be accepted.  
Need for revenge for petty things.  
Virtue signalling.  
Holding imaginary arguments in my head with people I encountered before, and what I should have said.  
Afraid to say something so people don't think I'm stupid or awkward, unless I know for sure they will respond positively.  

Rationally, I know all of this is purely irrational, years and years of dealing with this has shown me that these thoughts are almost always illusion, and have nothing to do with objective reality. I've learn to call out my own bullshit. But still, that's how my brain automatically interprets it, I still feel the feelings attached to those thoughts, and it's difficult to break from it. It's basically like pain from putting your hand in the oven, ""Oh it ain't bad, that pain is just some chemical reaction in brain producing that feeling"", but you still feel the pain and physical consequences of it, and you seek to avoid it.  

But I do feel the glimpses of heaven, when I don't feel RSD, in those moments when I feel great, focused, etc. I become opposite in this aspect, I just don't give a fuck. I'm still unmedicated, so I wonder if medication will have any effect.","dt0fu1v",235,1516546201,"2018-01-21 14:50:01"

"955","I've taken Vyvanse 50mg and Wellbutrin 300mg for about 6 months, and have mostly had success with it. I started lowering my dose of Vyvanse because I was having some afternoon anxiety with the combo, but even though my mood was good my ADHD symptoms started to return. My psych just switched me to Mydayis and this is my 6th day on it- still trying to adjust and see if it's better. 

My doc wants me to stay on Wellbutrin and a stimulant and thinks the combo is good for me... Just need to dial in the right med/dose. I'm also hoping it will work- but since my biggest issue is ADHD I'd quit the Wellbutrin before I quit the Vyvanse/Mydayis. I think it's a really common combo and many people have success with it. For me I'm realizing that eating regularly, sleeping a full night, and moderate exercise help mitigate any side effects of the two drugs. Go figure! Oh- and not drinking any alcohol has helped. It's such a bummer. Haha. 

By the way a school counselor told my parents that he suspected I had ADHD when I was a child and I think because girls don't always have the typical boy presentation (though I pretty much did- maybs people just have different expectations of girls), my parents ignored it and I struggled terribly through school.

"968","I'm male. When I first started on the path of attempting--emphasis on attempting, because it took many years--to get help, the psychiatrist at my hospital decided I had bipolar 2 and put me on lithium. If I knew then what I do now, I'd definitely have grilled him on some pretty ridiculous assumptions. The lithium did really nasty things, and I'm so incredibly lucky and glad that I wasn't driving when my body went numb and my vision titled about 30 degrees and started sliding to the side.

Over the phone I told him I was stopping the lithium and explained what had happened... I never heard from him again.

I'm a little angry at myself now, but unfortunately was clueless then, as I suspect I ought to have reported that to ... someone! I could have killed someone, or myself!

At this point, thankfully, I've been getting treatment for a bit over a decade for ADHD and it took me from having emotional breakdowns while driving home, massive depression, etc. into a semi-functional adult. There was a *lot* of work involved, and so many stumbling blocks, but at least I have a fighting chance, now.

Er, so, tl;dr, it isn't just women that get diagnosed as bipolar by psychs that probably shouldn't be diagnosing people, and dismissing some diagnosis, for things they don't seem to properly grasp. If it doesn't feel right, do **not** let them bully you into it. Second and third opinions are a normal thing. If they get offended, even more reason to refuse their treatment / diagnosis, as that is rather unprofessional and suggests their emotions are overruling the logic they should be applying for diagnosing you.","er721bf",2,1560564455,"2019-06-15 02:07:35"

It takes about 3 days for your body to rid of the medication entirely.

Are you hydrating yourself well enough? Eating on a schedule? Getting sure you get your electrolytes during the day?

Stress through adrenaline is a positive feedback loop, so the more you stress, the more you stress.
By the way, your body can get extremely stressed out if your blood sugar levels are not maintained at a normal level. So remember to eat. Eat a large breakfast in the morning, even if you don't feel like it. Avoid carbohydrate rich foods to ensure you don't just rollercoaster your insulin levels.

You could ease this by taking magnesium which inhibits peripherial norepinephrine.

You may have become tolerant to the dopamine effects of the medication, and could use a break.

"1021","As a writer I relate to this so much. A lot of people get so bogged down with How You Are Supposed To Write that they never find their voice in writing. But writing is a form of self-expression and it has to have your voice in it, or who exactly is talking? It can’t be you if it’s not your voice.

The funny thing is that I used to be so much better as channeling my voice but I went through a period where I got caught up in “what was expected of me” and that’s when my writing went to shit. Like I stagnated and couldn’t even express myself because my mind was so preoccupied with what is good writing that it had no space for what I actually want to write.

Once I realized that, I started writing like crazy.

Writing requires fluency, and you have to accept yourself to be fluent. Or you’ll be fighting against yourself instead of writing.

The only way I know how to write is by writing fast, because I need to constantly catch up to my thoughts. And I’ve been training myself to focus on my thoughts while writing and not overthink them and just get the words out and when that happens I can write like a machine.... all the words come bursting out of me and it’s like... the most liberating experience ever.

The funny thing is that that’s how my brain works. I string thoughts together and that’s how I process everything. Even in my therapy, I basically just talk and talk and talk and after 30 mins of talking I come to solutions and my therapist is like yeah good session. I think my therapist talks a total of 2 or 3 mins in a session, lol. It’s all me doing the talking and finding my own solutions.

And see, people think that people with ADHD have disjointed thoughts. But to me—how I’ve always experienced myself—my thoughts are not disjointed at all. I just think very abstractly. But it makes perfect sense to me.

Someone might read what I just said and think what does writing have to do with therapy. But in my head, in the big picture, what I’m ultimately talking about is not writing or therapy, it’s something much more abstract. I’m talking about how people relate to themselves and how they need to accept that to express their true selves. Otherwise they will be shells of themselves.... trying to be someone else inside. And that doesn’t work. You will not be a good writer. And you will not find solutions for yourself. Don’t hamper yourself. Allow yourself to shine.

2. Use a speech to text programme like Dragon Naturally Speaking to write anything longer than a few paragraphs. Tidy up the grammar after. 

3. TAKE BREAKS when you can. When I’m writing an essay or a report, I set a time for every 20 minutes to go and go something worse for 5 minutes. This is usually a jigsaw I keep on my living room floor. It helps you use a different part of your brain and avoid hyperfocus. 

4. Don’t be afraid to do more stimulation if you need it. A podcast while I’m cooking, soft instrumental music while I’m working, these things help me focus on one task. We need more stimulation, not less. 

5. Make lists. This is such a big one for me. As SOON as you think it, write it the fuck down. My reminds app runs my life and it’s so much easier now I’ve spent some time to train my brain to always, always, always write whatever needs to be done in the reminder app. That way, I’m not keeping it all in my brain and getting anxious.

Can I ""get by"" without my meds? Yeah. But every day is a struggle. I get depressed over the difficulty. I am constantly exhausted and disconnected. It is a mental and physical effort just to tackle tasks at work. It is daily hell.

Am I dependent? Nah, I suppose not. But my quality of life is orders of magnitude better at even the small-ish 15mg XR dose I'm on.

Waking up is easier, work projects and tasks are easier, meetings are easier to focus through, chit chat conversations don't piss me off, and with all that saved energy I'm happier.

So yeah, I could probably get through the day. I could do my job...sorta. But why subject myself to such strife and misery if I don't have to?

An alarm gets ignored by me usually. And as for the ""when the alarm goes off 'just do it' thing"" goes, It seems like circular logic to me, it's like people say the solution to my inability to properly motivate myself due to a physiological brain defect, is to just motivate myself. If people with autism don't want to talk funny, they should just set an alarm that reminds them to talk normally. FUCK EVERYTHING.

I've struggled with depression all my life, and the diagnosis really helped me to understand the degree to which constant criticism (for behaviors not under my conscious control) contributed to my sadness.

Most people would agree that it would be sadistic to punish a color-blind person for not distinguishing red from green.  It felt equally sadistic for me to be criticized for not having a neurotypical approach to life.  Especially because I scored high on standard tests but had no clue how to get homework done and basically lost everything (glasses, books, homework), all the time.

But, I'm a scrapper, and eventually found a profession(architecture) that requires creative problem-solving and includes periods of hyper-focus.

* I keep notebooks near me at all times so if I have a thought of something I need to finish outside of work I write it down and keep checking it and force myself to finish it.
* Last week I started exercising daily (not in the best shape)
* Two weeks ago I started drinking 8 glasses of water a day.
* I started taking a multi vitamin daily.

  
As for memory the writing down part has helped me ALLOT ive noticed when i type things out on a list on the computer i never read it and I don't remember it. But writing down in notebooks or sticky notes its helped allot.

You might notice a massive difference on stimulant medication. I believe non stimulants are more geared towards people who have anxiety and depression aside from adhd. I think a lot of adhd people do have anxiety and depression, but a lot of the times its caused by the negative consequences of unmanaged adhd symptoms, rather than existing by themselves.

So in adulthood, the lack of awareness of the condition, the lack of any learned coping mechanisms/external structure &amp; people's judgements (both real &amp; perceived) that you just aren't trying hard enough or are an asshole all build up to feeling crippling guilt &amp; shame.

ADHD is not a failure to mature.
ADHD is not a moral failing.
ADHD is not a weakness of character.
ADHD is a neurophysiological condition with roots in inherited genetic characteristics and a lot of developmental/environmental glitches.

It's so much easier to make it with the help of medication, even if your goal is not to need medication anymore it's still easier to make that journey with the help of medication.

You can't cure Adhd and eating stimulants for the rest of your life is not great. That's why the goal of medication is to help you arrive at a place where you can make without your medication.

So the best lives are definitely medication free and it is absolutely possible to make it without medication, you just need to find your place.

Honestly, I would look at psychiatrists in your area who have a website. Look at their areas for ADHD treatment. If they talk about testing, run in the opposite direction. If they talk about going through your history (the only real way to diagnose ADHD as of yet), email them. Ask about how they diagnose ADHD. Ask about how they treat it. If you get a good, understanding feeling from the email, go for it.

Before I changed insurance, I was sent to a neuropsychologist who wasted my time and called me depressed based on survey answers--despite my test results having the end all ""HELLO, THIS PERSON IS INTELLIGENT BUT HAS A WORKING MEMORY ISSUE,"" red flag that tends to lead to an ADHD diagnosis.

I said fuck it. I found someone out of network doing exactly what I described to you above--someone with significant experience dealing with ADHD. He listened. He said I was depressed--but that my depression was very obviously caused by years of ADHD creating an otherwise inexplicable propensity to fail in someone who had been expected to succeed.

He normally spent two appointments with potential ADHD cases, but in my glaringly obvious situation (he literally was mad at the last place for their mishandling of my case), he didn't adhere to a schedule for the sake of it, and prescribed Adderall XR on the spot.

1. Breathe in to the count of four
2. Hold the breath for four counts
3. Breathe out to the count of four
4. Hold that for four counts

That's it. Really. The tricky bit is that your brain will want to do \*literally anything\* except focus on your breath. That's the wild horse trying to follow its own path. When you catch your brain going off somewhere else - and it happens to all of us who aren't the Dalai Lama - forgive yourself, and bring your attention back to your breath. It's a practice. Your brain will insist that anything is more important, that it's boring, that you should be thinking about a thousand other things. But you are more than your brain. And this is an exercise that shows your brain who's boss. Set a timer for two minutes. Do it every day for a week. Then set it for five minutes the next week. Do it even when it's frustrating. I give the AstralMarmot promise that you will start to feel a difference, and that the very things you were frustrated by above begin to seem more manageable.

"1144","Woah, I read that and it basically describes myself. Before I was diagnosed, I graduated as a physical therapist (scraped through on 50%) and worked in less demanding/unstimulating areas of the profession and got bored very quickly and got performance managed a lot. I continued doing it because like you said it pays the bills. 

Then I got diagnosed with ADHD which improved things dramatically when I started medication, but i still ended up getting made redundant. I spent 3 months looking for what I wanted to do, and at this point i wanted to quit physical therapy entirely because i had such a terrible experience with working in the area. I started an online marketing course, began building up my photography business, had all these grand ideas for entrepreneurship (none have eventuated yet), started learning about music production all whilst looking for a ""dream bill paying job""

By some miracle i ended up getting offered a physical therapy job in the area that i was trying to score since graduation but had been paralysed by fear, so didn't have the experience most companies were looking for. I thought I had bombed out in the interview and I almost turned down the job due to this overwhelming anxiety. But so far it's been manageable and i will be seeing my psych to up my meds. 

When i've settled into this new job and know what the hell i'm doing physical therapy wise again, i will start working on a side business which is in the creative industries. This is my ultimate goal and if that doesn't work out, then at least i have something practical to fall back on. Hope this helps! ","d42fojz",1,1465488664,"2016-06-09 16:11:04"

I think it happens like this for all mental illness and invisible disabilities; people recognize that they have some point of relation (ie, sometimes they feel disorganized, can't focus) and figure that their solution for their temporary, normal sized problem will work for your permanent, huge sized problem.  The corollary - that if their 'solution' doesn't work, it must be poor application rather than a poor solution - aggravates me most.

"1157","I just started medication recently.  I was having really vivid dreams for the first week or two but reading your post made me realise they've died off.  Or at least I've gone back to not remembering them.

The problem I've been having is not starting anything because there's no structure.  Yet when I'm at my moms house, if she asks me to do anything I do it immediately.  Consider having your wife help you structure your days.  I know it would help me immensely if someone was around to direct my new-found energy.  Living alone and being unemployed I find myself wasting time, whole days in fact, doing nothing in particular.  It's just that with the medication I do nothing with even greater ease (ie. daydreaming/talking to myself endlessly without fidgeting or getting bored and moving onto something else, or flicking through tv channels for an unreasonable amount of time).  But when I do get into doing things I get a little manic too.  Like stop cleaning one thing because I noticed another thing to clean.

So it might be that you being ""manic"" is a lack of having a set structure of what you should do.  The medication should come with training to learn how to be a person who does things properly.  Especially for adults who've lived a whole life of disorientation.  Meds alone are whole new type of feeling lost at sea.  But definitely a preferable one.","c914e5t",6,1364070256,"2013-03-23 20:24:16"

"1159","I go in and out of the same boat, OP. With the handful of replies below, you're clearly not alone (the internet gotchou). A few things while reading your comment:

1) If they rather hang out with someone else...they would. I personally do not waste my time with people, giving energy, when I don't want to.

2) Sure, some people might be shallow. But who is really keeping count of their friends, other than you? The reality, maybe they are connecting with you in a way they might not have shown. Maybe they're also feeling depressed and need a friend who experiences similar things. 

3) Be grateful that in the very least they are sticking around because they **don't** want you to be depressed. And be another trigger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's hard, but try as often as possible to mitigate these negative thoughts with an alternative positive one. i.e. ""Well they want to have 20 friends, thats kinda cool they want me on their list"" Believe me, I still struggle. At a certain point these thoughts are only just your thoughts. You have no proof or evidence that these are facts. Best policy is to try to bring up a conversation - not in an accusatory way. Using the classic ""I"" statements. 

Also be mindful, of how you are projecting yourself. It's tough to be around people that are consistently negative. Easier said than done. Imagine even faking being positive? Even you would want to be around you more!","ghgn145",1,1609297624,"2020-12-30 03:07:04"

Once I meet someone it's all good, but getting to that point is tough for me.

Overall I tend to be great around friends and family, but quiet around strangers. Dominate conversations a lot with friends and family, but if I don't know the person then it can be difficult for me. I'm not the kind of person who randomly goes up to someone reading a book I like (most of what people are reading around here is going to be textbooks anyway).

I also don't normally make the first move to meet with a friend. I never know what we would do if we met up. I think I'd be better here if I had more interests/hobbies/etc that I could randomly meet up with a friend to do.

"1162","No, he is assuming his audience will agree. He's appealing to common knowledge to complete his point. Broken down:

Info new to laypeople, that IS thus presented as fact (he's an authority at a podium, has graphs etc.): One proof that this is a neurological problem is that coping mechanisms relying on the oversight of others cannot be maintained in their absence.

Reminder of already-known fact relevant to interpretation of the new one: In general a vast diminution of direct parental influence is expected as children reach the age of majority and/or move out. (Given a broad-backed normal distribution - i.e. what's happened with nearly every parent-child pairing any of us has observed pass that threshold - this story told by the average has robust relevance to nearly all individual cases.)

Conclusion produced by the putting together of authority-fact and consensus-fact: Therefore all your scaffolding efforts will crumble to nothing if the neurological problem has not been addressed.

You literalized one of the most common figurative uses of language, the replacement of a representative instance by the group or set to which it belongs. E.g. if I said ""human beings like cheese,"" my literalizer would say, ""Nuh-uh, I'm a human being and I don't, and plus everyone I met in Singapore thinks it's gross etc."" and then I and the space aliens to whom I was explaining our eating preferences would in unison sing:

Literalizer
Literalizer
You
You're a literalizer
Literalizer
Literalizer
Literalizer baby
You you you are
You you you are
Literalizer

    Parents of children with a history of ADHD report almost 3 times as many peer problems as those without a history of ADHD (21.1% vs. 7.3%).
    Parents report that children with a history of ADHD are almost 10 times as likely to have difficulties that interfere with friendships (20.6% vs. 2.0%).

Social issues are often a driver of suicide as outcasts would rather not exist then deal with the trauma of daily school / work / bullying. etc

About half of children with ADHD referred to clinics have behavioral disorders as well as ADHD."" - With a rate this high you have already significantly eliminated a large portion of the ""normal"" population that would skew these results in the other way. I would have been extremely shocked if the rate was lower or on the same level as standard suicide rate.

I think the MOST IMPORTANT take away from this is absolutely to seek help and treatment, Keep it under control and keep a positive outlook on where you are going whenever possible. Meds reduced the suicide rate, this isn't because it made you a different person, it helped cope with stresses and issues that could drive to suicide.

&gt;Episodes of substance-induced mood disorder due to the direct effects of a medication, or other somatic treatments for depression, drug abuse, or toxin exposure, or of mood disorder due to a general medical condition need to be excluded before a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder can be made.

From Wikipedia article about amphetamine
&gt;At therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength

&gt;Less common side effects include anxiety, **change in libido**, **grandiosity**, irritability, repetitive or obsessive behaviors, and restlessness

One of the criterias of the dsm 5 manual for that disorder is to first exclude the possibility of it being drug/medication induced. He is taking amphetamine, a drug that has the symptoms she listed as possible side effects and has lost weight wich could lead to his dosage having more effect. You need to consider that this is a direct effect of his medication before you throw bipolar disorder at someone based on **one** written account of his symphtoms ","d1spagg",7,1459978677,"2016-04-06 21:37:57"

"1230","You are welcome! Np for the late reply. I always do that myself;) 

It's funny. I had a more subtle experience when I had a cold once and took Sudafed which has much less of an effect than a ADHD med, but nonetheless is a stimulant. Here i was at work, sick with a cold, and all of a sudden i could work better than normal??? Obviously I wouldn't take it around the clock or anything but if I really needed to buckle down on a work project I would take it and could begin to concentrate and do things. Little did I know back then that it was helping ADHD. I had no clue of my adhd. That is an interesting story you have. Taking a med for one thing and it was helping your ADHD. Go figure. Happy accident;) not that you had to go through your weight loss issues which I'm sure was very difficult. But that you figured out adhd was the cause of many of yoyr problems! And to notice such an extreme difference in how you functioned so much better. Wow!

I'm not sure because I have never taken your other med, but I would think adderall has more kick in it. I'm interested to see how you respond to it. I'm glad your doctor appointment went so well and he/she was accepting of it and helpful. Many ppl on this sub seem to be ridiculed by docs and psychs for even thinking they might have ADHD and being told they don't when, in fact, they do. I hear it all too often. 

I completely understand with your work situation. If it hadn't been for work, I would have probably not have gone to talk to doctors to talk about it (even though I was also a disaster in every other area of my life;). I can't handle work and life at the same time and my performance at work suffers from not being able to concentrate and procrastinate because things seem overwhelming. I should have realized after going through a few jobs that it wasn't the jobs, it was my ADHD. The pattern just kept repeating itself with every job until my self-esteem was in the toilet and I would get very anxious/depressed as a result. It was beyond frustrating and I never thought it could be fixed/helped. I felt like I was just broken and there was nothing I could do about it. I tried all sorts of anxiety and depression meds with no success. The psychs were only treating (if you can call it that) the depression/anxiety itself and not what was causing it.

Your work environment does sound like an ADHD nightmare;) lol. Sounds like there are a lot of distractions and can be boring so you can't stay engaged. I honestly could never have a job where my attention has to shift so rapidly. I would get so irritated being taken in and out of focus. I truly feel for you. But we all have to make a living and do things that are not optimal for our ADHD brains and that is when we need a crutch to get through it just to be able to function like ""normal"" people. One job I had in a big office with a lot of coworkers, really took away all self esteem. I'm a smart person but am slower with things at comprehending. I always did well in school (since I would study hours on end), but I could not for the life of me keep up with everyone else at this job. Very fast-paced. And my coworkers just seemed to breeze by like the job was no big deal. So I would work late and procrastinate all day and do work when people were leaving the office because that was the only time I could really concentrate. I actually probably would have done much better if I was secluded on a desert island doing the work. Lol. So anyway, I really really hope the med helps to improve your performance and increase your focus at work. I think it will if your other med worked for you. Best of luck and if you feel like it, let me know how it goes!","el07hla",1,1555401970,"2019-04-16 08:06:10"

From a neurological basis ADHD makes sense to me. I've always had intense interests I could easily hyperfocus on but then couldn't spend more than 10 seconds looking at a budget with my wife. From what I understand SCT doesn't work like this but is rather – as the name implies – delayed cognition. Is that close to right?

Hyperfocus
Sleep problems
Zoning out when people are talking

Everything else I somewhat expected but hadn’t joined the dots on causal. The sleep one was frustrating as I’d had sleep difficulties my entire life and have seen Doctors about it many times, even as a 5 yr old.

So despite pretty much the grand slam of symptoms I didn’t get diagnosed until my late thirties despite it impacting me severely, it only happened then because someone said something at work about themselves that made me google it, saw the symptoms and was like ‘oh daaaaamn’. When the shrink finally confirmed after pretty extensive evaluation he said I was basically textbook obvious within a few minutes.

"1241","I have ADHD and social anxiety.  I personally don't feel like I *necessarily* lack social skills, but rather am generally unable to apply them.  I haven't been on medication for ADHD long enough to comment on whether it helps or not; the medication I have for anxiety however is definitely insufficient for social situations.

Most of my difficulty socialising comes from being terrified of possible outcomes or how the person feels about me.   I absolutely struggle to do stuff like introduce myself to new *peers* unless they act friendly to me first, or sit next to people unless I'm invited, etc.  I'm just generally terrified they hate me, hate the sight of me, hate being in the presence of me, and that they're going to say something really horrible to me if I try interact with them.  All I can think about is every possible bad outcome to the situation.  In some situations, I'm paralysed long enough that the opportunity to interact with the person disappears.  Being aware of the irrationality of these thoughts does little to help.

Another aspect of it for me, though **much** less common, is feelings of inferiority.  In a uni group learning class I had last Monday, I spent the entire session holding back tears just from *being in a class full of people* who I felt so inherently inferior to.  A big aspect of those sessions is asking peers for help, and every time I did so it would take me several minutes just to work up the confidence to ask, and even then I would feel really guilty for asking them, and would be terrified they were going to think I was dumb, and had no idea what I was doing, etc.","dueafye",6,1518889199,"2018-02-17 17:39:59"

"1261","I agree wholeheartedly, but can I also just add for those who are fellow parents here: We need to incorporate constructive criticism into the raising of our kids.  For a while now society has been telling us to treat our kids as snowflakes. Kids don't ""fail"" anymore; they are praised for ""participating"".  There are no ""fail"" grades any more, just ""needs development, but well done for trying"".  They are told that they can do anything and will succeed no matter what, and that doing a mediocre job is good enough.

The intent behind this constant praise is pure, but it does not prepare kids for the challenges that real life will inevitably throw at them. These snowflake kids often crumble at the first real failure that they experience later in life, often then fearing failure so much that they don't dare to try anything bold.  

Kids need to learn confidence in their strengths, to value the human traits that OP describes, but also learn how to fail and constructively self-reflect on their mistakes and failures without feeling like complete failures in the process.  This applies to all kids, but it is so much more important for kids with ADHD because those of us with ADHD tend to be far more critical on ourselves, and our days are filled with little failures that threaten to drown us if we are not good at navigating them.","g89dkos",0,1602282045,"2020-10-09 22:20:45"

There are lots of jobs that don't involve sitting in an office. :) I've worked a myriad of jobs, and since the office works pays better than retail/food service (I'm working on my degree now - non-trad), I tried to do that. Hated it - every office job I've had, the majority of the time I've reddited on the clock.

I'm sorry about what happened with your boss today - but I'm so glad that it's been relatively without hard feelings! Has your boss said whether he'll give you a good recommendation? 

While you're looking for another job, think about doing some temp work. It'll be something new for a while (different people and places and jobs), and it could help you find a place you like.

Therapy will make an extremely better difference for you, youll figure out how to deal with your ADHD, why you have it, how to get better and improve your life with it.

Ohh and you've probably had ADHD long before you were diagnosed, so don't forget that. Sometimes our subconscious will take information that is new or not understood and turn it into anxiety.

"1272","This is something I struggled with after being prescribed Adderall at first. I have found the following to help:

- Rephrase your internal dialog from ""I am angry"" to ""I am experiencing anger""; this is subtle, but the difference is between ""I am controlled by my anger"" and ""I feel some amount of anger, but I am in control""

- When you think ""I am experiencing anger"" add ""because of X reason""; this allows you to healthily accept that you can't control your emotions, but can control your actions, and gives you a moment to snap out of a raw emotional state to a more logical one

- Once you have identified the reason for experiencing anger, ask yourself if there is anything you can do that would solve the underlying issue leading to anger; if there is not, remove yourself from the situation until you no longer feel angry - activities that burn energy such as taking a short walk can be a good way to constructively cope with anger

- Whatever you do, do _not_ think about the fact that you are angry in of itself; negative emotions are black holes, and the more you feed them and allow your thoughts to be controlled by them, the bigger they get - this is why you need to accept that you feel them, because otherwise you'll get stuck in a cycle where you can't let go

I put stuff in their proper place as I find them, and for anything that has no specific place/has to be moved, I keep it in small, tidy piles.

"1318","I also just recently did this experiment, but mine was basically 20mg XR and 10mg IR as needed (once or twice per day). 

If I dose too high, I do feel more tired and kind of like a zombie but without the ability to actually fall asleep. I also noticed on days when I didn't get 6+ hrs of sleep, the effect of the medicine was less.  

I also noticed feeling crappy if I didn't maintain a good eating schedule. I usually eat 2500-3000 calories per day and one day I went 8 hrs or so without food and started to feel really bad. Eating regularly helps. Force it...eat small enjoyable snacks if you have to (nuts, bananas, yogurt).  

Right now I'm trying IR only instead of XR because XR is expensive for me.

"1319","I read some good things about it.  The principle is to eat only what cavemen ate, which seems silly. But the idea behind it - to avoid all processed foods and grains - is great. 

It goes like this - unprocessed lean meats, green vegetables and fruits are all good. Processed foods (anything with sugar added, high fructose corn syrup, cakes, cookies, etc.) are off limits. Also, grains, like wheat and corn, aren't allowed. Starchy vegetables like potatoes are also bad.  However, the book I have says that a person can cheat a little on these things.

I like it because I don't really want to eat all this chemically garbage and the sugars, wheat, high fructose corn syrup, etc., all wreak havoc on blood sugar levels. It forces me to eat foods that release energy over longer periods.

I wouldn’t personally recommend it.  You are just getting your start in life, and there are many lessons and skills to develop as you build on the last thing you learned.  You are right on time. 

If you are looking for a life changing challenge to test your mettle, then you can choose from a list of over 1,000 other careers that do not require you to stop taking your meds. 

In the military you’ll be in competition for rank/income/opportunities with people that do not need meds.  And you will not be able to take meds.  Which means you will be entering a twisty turny race with blindfolds on.  And that would be dumb. 

It is also unethical to put your fellow troops at risk when the military expressly does not hire ADHD brains. The loophole that would allow you to sneak in is there for people who do not have it, and were prescribed adhd meds they don’t really benefit from. That is not you.  

Sure It might be done by other people who might have made it through without contributing to the harm of a fellow American, but it is still not ethical.  And you wouldn’t be able to live with yourself if it went that way.","emprure",4,1557209528,"2019-05-07 06:12:08"

For me, the effects of bupropion are there, but they're hard to notice. It's all little things, like not getting headaches for focusing on job applications all day, waking up at about the same time every day, being able to keep track of what I'm saying, and being able to focus a bit more/not needing to grab snacks to give my brain a boost of energy.  All in all, I like it but would like its effects to be stronger/more noticeable. So I'll be upping my dosage soon and starting CBT.

Paying attention in class was a complete lost cause for me. Even in an adrenaline/stress fueled state, I could barely manage some classes. One thing you can do if you have a diagnosis, is get an accomodation from the school - they can find someone to get you notes for the class. Highly recommend still going, especially if you have a fidget toy(I personally knit sometime or brought silly putty or doodled), as it helps you focus on listening, and you can review the written material afterwards.

"1345","You should know going into this that even if there is a clinical issue, you are still going to have an immense amount of personal work to do. If there are emotional issues tangled up with clinical issues, it's more difficult, but lots of people are in that situation. Either they are dealing with a parent or partner who thinks that they are making excuses or they have self-esteem issues within their own mind. 

First off, go read the faq on the right sidebar of this page. Watch videos like the stuff on totallyadd.com and listen to other people struggling with adhd. Also watch some videos by medical professionals talking about the biological understanding we currently have of it. It's not just absent-mindedness, it's a definable thing. Educate yourself first.

While ADHD is a physical condition, it spawns a whole complex of problems. Beyond the focus issues, the anxiety and depression also have negative consequences in your life. If you feel uncertain about this, you should consider talking through this with someone besides whatever treatment you might pursue with a Doctor. At minimum, you could talk to a support group or someone currently having success with treatment. There are such things as 'life coaches' who would advise you. Even professional councilor could at least help you sort out your thoughts regarding the condition.

And even if you clearly have the clinical symptoms and medical treatment helps somewhat, you'll still have to undo the bad habits and get organized. You might be able to reduce distractablity with medication, but if you have a habit of wasting hours on Facebook, that's up to you to fix.

That being said, what has helped me-

Writing things out seems to help. Actually make a list, on paper- not the computer. Handwritten notes, longform, full sentences. I'll write on a notepad ""I am going to do my taxes. I need the files from the drawer and the forms in my desk. I will not check my email until I am done."" If I can focus enough to write that, I feel like I have already started working and it's easier to transition to actually doing it.

I'm using a free program called 'brain workshop'. I don't know if will help long-term, but it's so cognitively demanding it feels like a warm up for any task requiring my full attention. It's also useful to assess my capability at any give point. You know how you can be having the craziest dream, but it seems perfectly normal at the time? Then you wake up and realize how absurd the whole thing was? Sometimes it's hard to tell how unfocused you are in the moment. There have been times that I felt ok, but I could not hold my attention together for three seconds. You will start to notice patterns of sleep or diet that impairs your performance, and you can manage that stuff in your life better based on what you find.

I think there's a lot that someone can do if they make an effort to better understand their minds and start a program of self-improvement to better achieve the goals they set out for themselves. That's not really specific to ADHD, though. So to answer the question, yes there are things you can do. CBT is interesting, but unproven. Regardless, you will be able to do that more effectively with the help of a professional. I would encourage you to get a screen from a competent practitioner, even if you don't get clinical treatment. I think you will find it most informative.

an ask for quiet hours is a request for a disability accommodation.

Basically you just focus on the other person and remember basic things like the sweetest sound to any human is their own name.  


It's hard to get out of back-and-forth mode where you are trying to listen to the other person while simultaneously trying to come up with something interesting-but-not-weird to reply with about yourself when you get your opening.  That's how most humans interact and they do ok even though it's boring as hell but it's really hard for ADHDers to emulate.


It turns out that all you really need to do is focus on the other person and be interested in their perspective.  Not only is that easier to do but it's kind of an advantage for ADHD people who are good at thinking on their feet and being creative.  Most people aren't used to anyone actually listening to them let alone come up witty and interesting follow up questions about their story.  You wouldn't believe how effective this simple thing is to get people to really like you and think of you as one of their favorite people.


Once you understand this then just overhearing most other conversations is cringey where both sides are just trying to one-up each other by making it about themselves.  WAY easier to SEEM interesting than doing nothing more than expressing genuine interest in another person's story.
  

Be positive, be empathetic and don't be judgemental, even if the conversation turns into griping about another coworker.  Be humble about your abilities and intelligence and treat them like they are smart and fun.  Unless specifically asked, don't try to offer advice to try and solve a problem that they are complaining about.  Most people just want want empathy, not solutions.  You should be saying ""that must be hard for you, I'm sorry you are dealing with that right now"" WAY more than ""well have you tried blah blah to the blah blah, once my cousin was blah blah'ing and that really blah blah'ed well for him so you should try that"".  


Most people most the time just want to feel understood and empathized with.  That's all your focus should be on.  Sure you may end up helping them with advice or telling about yourself IF THEY ASK but most the time it's just an exchange of you offering some mild complement about their name or something they did or their watch or whatever bullshit comes to mind.  A few more follow up exchanges FOCUSED ON THEM...and get on with your day.


It's so much less effort to seem interesting by BEING INTERESTED than to talk about yourself or come up with your own witty material.  Let all the normal people supply the material, just be their outlet.  It's super easy, doesn't take any more time than the inane chatter you are being subjected to anyway.  Might as well make it an opportunity to make your life easier.  You'd be shocked at how much better life is when acquaintances genuinely like you and will go out their way to help you and watch out for you. All because you asked them a follow up question about their stupid fucking corgi last week and pretended like that photo of that ugly dumbass dog was the sweetest thing you've seen all week.


I just want to be left alone most the time, I don't need more friends and I don't need to feel like part of a damn team all the time outside of my family and a couple friends.   Yet, I routinely have coworkers confide some very deep stuff to me just because I'm liked and trusted.   It's kind of odd being by far the most introverted person in most groups yet having most those people think I'm the most outgoing and friendly one of the group.  Simply because most my brief smalltalk interactions are about them, not me.  That most people don't do this makes just makes it even more effective.","dkdwkg2",3,1500395508,"2017-07-18 16:31:48"

"1390","Hey you. I'm not here to tell you what to think or what to do or anything, but I've been struggling( to some extent I *still do*) with the same doubts and questions you're dealing with.

I periodically slip into some sort of identity crisis where I begin to question everything about myself: are my emotions really *mine* if they're affected by medications that enables me to lead a semi-normal life? Is it worth to give up my ""emotional highs"" where I feel as though I can conquer the world if it means I don't experience the following lows where I feel as though the world is too much? 

It would be a lie to say that I consistently reach the same conclusion: that no, the highs are not nearly high enough to counterbalance the crippling lows. Human emotions are weird at times and they're all over the place, and they change - even more so in ADHD people.

I still ""miss"" the safety and comfort I found in my depressive episodes and self-destructive coping mechanisms, but honestly: no matter how melancholic I feel and how much I want to get back into my safety/comfort zone, the rational voice in my head knows it was a shitty fucking time of my life where I don't want to end up, *ever again*. Life before meds and mental stability was never as good or safe or beautiful as I remember it as. It was fucking ***awful*** to go from feeling on top of the world to feeling like I was utter scum and not really wanting to be here.

I'm gonna stop before this becomes way to long, but honestly, we sometimes have to revisit our past memories and awful experiences to overcome our melancholy and move forward. The past isn't as good as I remember it, and I'm in a much, much better place now.

At least, I hope so.","dgda93u",9,1492418166,"2017-04-17 08:36:06"
"1391","For me the biggest issue is competence. The first Psychiatrist who saw me, while I was in a Psychiatry for 2 weeks, said I could not have ADHD, because I read books and I do not run around like crazy. This is a level of incompetence, which should make you eager to get another diagnosis. I think the biggest issue in misdiagnosing patients, which can go false positive or false negative, is that most persons who diagnose are not really that competent in keeping up with the science. The Psychiatrist who did diagnose me, almost did not, because I was to good in school, although there is research about high functioning in school despite ADHD. Furthermore its at all questionable, if report cards should have that big of a role in diagnosing ADHD as well as the questionnaire, my mom had to do, about how I behaved 15 years ago.
Not to mention all the stories on this Reddit of mindlessly incompetent personel. You should only accept diagnosis, where the argument for you having it is in line with the best known practice at the time and then it should makes sence to you in most cases.","d8g5d1v",4,1475735829,"2016-10-06 06:37:09"

I can't help it and she thinks I find her boring, she doesn't exactly believe ADHD is a real disease, and I'm just using it as an excuse. :(

I know that didn't help but one thing I heard helps if physical contact. Making physical contact with someone while talking to them can be weird but it definitely keeps you focused. 

I'm trying this out, it's been working a little: I have a paperclip in my wrist brace(I always have my wrist brace on because of a recent fracture). I only touch or fiddle with it if someone else is talking to me. It's sort of a physical indicator to remind me to stay focused. 

Hope that helps, I know I was shit in school or any other conversation that isn't interactive. When someone starts telling lengthy stories or talking about themselves for long periods of time without asking me a question or inviting me to participate, my focus drifts.

"1422","I got diagnosed late in life (38). My parents especially were resistant, but I explained it consistently and scientifically, and as my doctor suggested, they would come around once they saw a change in my behaviour. 

I told them I thought they both had it several times and explained why. Eventually, I asked my mother to try one of my 5mg dexies and she did. I called her later and asked what she was up to, and she said she was just doing whatever, relaxing on the sofa...which is the first time I've ever heard her say that. I knew what happened to her was the same thing that happened to me: the silence was deafening. 

From there she agreed to see my diagnosing GP and he did his thing. He agreed she had mild to moderate ADHD but also some other issues which he wanted to treat as well before he could be confident about treating the addles. There's a genetic disorder called Pyrolles which has a lot of overlapping things with ADHD, and it's treated with supplements. She started the supplement program for that, and went to see specialists for thyroid and diabetes, went overseas travelling with my father, and just kind of forgot about it, although I believe she was still taking the supplements but isn't convinced they're doing anything. My GP did ask me about how she was doing, and I'm planning on pursuing it with her going into the New Year. 

Fundamentally, I realized she knew her health was ailing, she wanted help with treatment, but she wasn't able to organize herself to do it properly, because of course ADHD. She had become trapped in a prison of pessimism which I'm sure most people here would recognise. She lost her mother when she was 13, and father just two years later. She married at 21 into an intense, emotional family which included her in their daily lives, and were rife with ADHD themselves so it went unnoticed. After struggling for years to overcome the echos of traumatic child-abuse at her hands, it finally all made sense. She had no freaking clue how to cope with life, with the expectations put on her, and no one had really ever recognised her struggles due to ADHD. Perhaps worse, no one had ever taken an active interest in helping her overcome her genuine difficulties. I felt great compassion for her, which allowed me to forgive her, and organize her doctor's visits, transport her to and from them, help her get her prescriptions and remind her of how to take them. It was clear to me she was grateful for this, and I feel better for it.","f98lx6f",1,1575179923,"2019-12-01 05:58:43"

"1452","Can't really relate since I was super anxious about spending money for years and am still cheap, but here are some things I do. I put budgeting stuff at the bottom. Budgeting is really really important. Otherwise managing your money is like trying to cope with time blindness without any alarms or any sort of time-keeping device; you're going to fuck it up. You've gotten lots of tips on that already, though, so I wanted to kind of highlight things that haven't been said yet.

I try not to think of avoiding spending as depriving or punishing myself. *Pasting part of this from the budgeting section, since it's also relevant here:* I keep a weekly budget and any money left over at the end of the week goes into a savings account, ostensibly for something fun. Ex. I'm into photography, so I might pretend I'm saving for a macro lens. Maybe I'll actually buy one, but maybe not. Doesn't matter. The point is to provide myself with a positive motivator for saving/staying with my budget, since I don't find negative ones very compelling. I'm not denying myself X $100 thing or avoiding eviction, having the electricity shut off, living on beans and rice for two weeks, etc.; I'm giving myself $100 that I can eventually spend on something way cooler.

If I'm tempted to buy something, I challenge myself to revamp what I have or find a cheaper alternative. It's fun, saves me money, and helps me appreciate what I already have. Why shop when I already have all this cool stuff? Ex. Extension tubes instead of a macro lens, blankets to use as a couch cover instead of a new couch, paint to update a table instead of a new table. If you want new clothes, go through your old ones and find things you forgot you owned, try out new combinations, modify them by cutting off sleeves or turning a dress into a shirt, etc. If you want new shoes, polish/clean and put new laces in your old ones. Look up tutorials or do an image search for inspiration. 

Experiences &gt; stuff. That applies to the above -- painting a table or getting to reminisce about wearing this shirt on a first date or this dress on a past trip -- but in general, I try to restrict spending to necessities and hobbies. Obviously hobbies can get expensive, but I try to stick to cheap ones + cheap supplies. (Not a gear person, so photography is very affordable for me and makes free things like going on walks way more appealing). $20 headlamp = a year and counting of night photography. $20 worth of art supplies = two months of painting, drawing, etc., plus ""new"" furniture. $1,000 couch = exciting for a week or two; then I might as well be sitting on the old one.

A tip for online shopping I've seen a lot here: Instead of immediately buying something, just add it to your wish list/buy it later list. You still get to shop, and it can give you a rush comparable to the one you would get from actually buying things, but you'll probably have moved on by the time you think to go back and look at the list. Also, delete your stored payment info to make checking out harder/more time-consuming.

Also, this is kind of silly, but...play The Sims or another game where you can ""buy"" things that doesn't have an option for spending real money (ex. in-app purchases). It's been ages since I last played, but being able to spend a fuckton of Simoleons on stuff for my Sim's houses helped me resist the urge to spend real money on my real house, since I'm constantly wanting to change up my surroundings.

&amp;#x200B;

**BUDGETING**

Keep a budget. Design your own if you're into that kind of thing or don't vibe with any of the pre-made ones you find. Ex. My only spending categories are bills, debt, savings, and etc. (everything else). Having subcategories for things groceries, gas, and entertainment felt nitpick-y and like setting myself up for failure, since I could easily overspend in one of those categories while staying under budget overall.

I calculate my expected income for the month and add up bill amounts (use last month's bill if the new one hasn't arrived yet) -- rent, utilities, subscriptions, debt payments, etc. Then I subtract that amount from my expected income. That's my spending money for the month. Then I set a daily and weekly budget. Ex. If I have $600 for April, 600/30 = 20 (daily budget). 20\*7 = 140 (weekly budget for 4/1-28, then $40 for 4/29-30). This turns it into a game and makes it feel more immediate; staying under budget = winning, and it keeps me focused on the day or week vs. the entire month. (At this point, I actually have a set daily budget vs. just whatever's left over after necessary spending -- but you need to track your spending for a bit to figure out what's realistic for you. I also set it a bit higher than necessary, since it's satisfying being able to transfer some money into savings every week.)

I also like to give myself a cushion. Like if I'll have $600 left over after bills, I might give myself $400 spending money for the month. That way I won't start the next month with $0 and I'm okay if I go a little over. If that does happen, I transfer money from savings to cover it, which motivates me to replenish my savings.

Every 7 days (or more often, if I feel like it or make a larger purchase), I input all my purchases. Any money left over goes into a savings account, ostensibly for something fun. Ex. I'm into photography, so I might pretend I'm saving for a macro lens. Maybe I'll actually buy one, but maybe not. Doesn't matter. The point is to provide myself with a positive motivator for saving/staying with my budget, since I don't find negative ones very compelling.","fll22ho",1,1585252173,"2020-03-26 19:49:33"

"1465","OP I have been dealing with this same exact shit for *decades*, and even when I was finally given an ADHD diagnosis as an adult, none of this was ever mentioned as a possible symptom, so it's been up to me to notice the pattern myself and put 2 &amp; 2 together

my guess is that with some of the more extraordinarily mundane shit that our particular brains just aren't wired to handle very well (for me, math is a really big one), even thinking about trying to force our focus on it is just such a huge drain on our internal resources that it triggers some kind of immediate sleep response

this is obviously based on nothing but my own experiences, but it's the most plausible explanation I can come up with for how exactly I feel during these episodes and when they start to really set in

although tbh I'd also certainly love it if we could pool all of our various perspectives together and see if we can work out a better and more definitive explanation for this shit—or at least put together a nice little support group community for all of us who have spent all these years thinking we were the only one with this fairly unique and specific issue, kind of like r/earrumblersassemble but with like people who just get super tired having to focus on unbelievably tedious shit, you know what I mean

"1480","I once spilled A WHOLE WATER JUG/CARAFE/DECANTER whatever you want to call it OVER MY NEW LAPTOP 

And I didnt wipe it away for 3 or 4 hours? I was like ""I probably just spilt it on the floor, it's fine""

Why I didnt turn the light on? Well I wanted to watch something on the ouch and wouldve had to walk 5 steps to get to the light switch.","gad5rv6",1,1603877823,"2020-10-28 09:37:03"
"1481","I feel the same way, ""cured"", even though I know it's not a magical pill that has solved all my problems. It sure has made a lot of things better though!  It's also helped push me in to the decision of ending a 5 year relationship that I kept thinking was going to get better, but after 3 years of having the same fight, and NOW (since medication) realizing just how long 3 years really is...I feel like a fog has been lifted. It's amazing how much clarity my mind has now.  It reminds me of that movie, Step Brothers, when the ""brothers"" build those makeshift bunk beds and jump around saying ""now look at all this room we have for activities!!"" (I may not have quoted that accurately, lol) - I feel like my brain has so much more room to process information, I can think both collectively and singularly now. 

Like you, I did good in school too. WITHOUT studying. I could not, for the life of me, sit down and study unless it consisted of me drawing and mapping ideas, making flow charts, lists, charts- using markers and crayons, producing these colorfully detailed works of art. Taking notes or making flash cards was too tedious and mind numbing, unless I Incorporated art into it. If I could maintain A's and B's without applying myself,  there's no telling how much could be accomplished if I I tried. ","e3a0gmb",2,1532932442,"2018-07-30 06:34:02"

"1483","It might be an awareness thing, too. I noticed that when I forget to take my meds, I'll be painfully aware of the difference in my thoughts and behavior. Realizing that a most of the anxiety was situational and self-inflicted made it easier to manage. A lot easier, at that. 

It's tough, and I have no practical suggestions for doing this, but try being patient with yourself. Saying ""it's okay"" to your feelings of anxiety might help. The book ""The Charisma Myth"" has some good exercises for this now that I think about it.","cn460ae",1,1419426553,"2014-12-24 13:09:13"
"1484","Thanks, I appreciate the empathy. Every day is another trauma. I keep telling myself just that - that it's all about the journey, the journey transforms us and makes us stronger, it's not about the destination. Frodo Baggins' achievement isn't in defeating 7 armies. His achievement is in how he transforms himself as a person, or as a hobbit, whatever. And the journey is what makes the book/movie/licensing so interesting.

Yesterday was yesterday, today is today. So last night I got to work fixing things. Ran to pharmacy, got medication for my 8 YO, took boys to bookstore, bought a big puzzle to keep them busy today.","c8owc6u",1,1362316820,"2013-03-03 13:20:20"
"1485","People who don't need meds that take them often say they feel euphoria and a rush of energy to get things done, and that's why they abuse them.

While some people who need them do get that feeling too, most I've spoken to feel the way you described...a calm quiet that isn't really noticable unless you take the time to sit and do so.

"1487","I am on medication and it certainly helps while it's working. Now the struggle is evenings.

"1488","If you are lying to your partner, there's something wrong. Either with you or with her or with the relationship in general. Lying never fixes anything long-term. Ever.

Whether or not you take your meds is your choice and yours alone - not hers. *However*, if your choice is negatively impacting her life, she has a right to point it out to you and ask that you do something to make things better. I know when my husband gets annoyed that I've forgotten my meds, it's partially because I can get... less pleasant to be around... when I'm off of them, but also because he wants me to be able to function as best I can. I've heard similar things from others who have been in relationships with ADHD partners.

I understand the difficulties with sexual side effects... My husband and I both take lexapro, so... I guess we have sexual side effects, but I wouldn't know. :/ lol. I'll also say pre-meds-killing-libidos, sex and arguments tended to be inversely related, so there may be some of that effect going on here. 

Coping with obsessive tendencies? Find distractions, maybe get some therapy, mindfulness... But, ultimately, it may likely take restarting meds. If the side effects of your meds make it difficult for you to be compliant, then that is something you should discuss with your doctor, and consider making changes to medications or doses.","d3r1dh2",7,1464736314,"2016-05-31 23:11:54"

"1490","It's always reassuring to hear how many ADHD people do this, especially because I was considered a ""good reader"" since I was very young. It was true that I could read and read, but even at my fastest and most focused I would *always* end up needing to reread several pages. 

I just didn't realize it was unusual at the time, I thought hearing without hearing and seeing without seeing happened all the time to everyone. 

When it comes to conversation, these days I don't really interact much with even nice and well-meaning people who find this troubling or annoying. If they can't hang, no hard feelings, we can stick to small talk or polite smiles. My ride or dies are the people who say, ""...aaand she's gone.

"1492","I got started on Ritalin. And after even the initial testing dose I could tell that this was going to work. Doing things just got easier, I got both the energy to start something, and the focus to see it through. This boosted my confidence, and motivation, which lead me to deal with the most pressing issues. Needless to say my mood has improved when I have outlooks to get back into my studies, get a new scholarship, I have paid my bills, upheld my obligations and been a great friend. 

Ritalin isn't much different from caffeine if you look at the effects (except it is less addictive, and has less of a tolerance buildup). It affects me less than anti-depressants did, it just makes the distance from thought to action shorter, and easier. Getting things done, and upholding my obligations has made me positive towards the future. I am no longer a failed student with bills I can't pay and relationships I can't manage. I am gaining confidence through doing things.

It is just so easier to keep organized and to plan the day. The depression enhanced my procrastination, my meds removes it. Seeing the positive improvements in my life every day now. I read my first academic book, and then I read some Nietzsche for teh lulz. 

I don't notice the effects of the meds on myself, but rather on the actions I complete. I see my apartment is cleaner, and my bills is paid, and my girlfriend is happy, and I am happy because it is going well.","ccxq9rb",1,1382513670,"2013-10-23 07:34:30"
"1493","I would never thought of that. My partner asked me to get test for diabetes, he have family history of diabetes. Two of his family members is Type I. He often would say I look lethargic, it is a common symptoms of Diabetes. Ironically my doctor called today to let me know they sent the bloodwork paperwork to LabCorp. I noticed I would be lethargic during my off med day. Perhaps it would be my off med day is the reason of my lethargy.","edrtgvw",1,1547177823,"2019-01-11 03:37:03"

"1496","I started meds at a young age and my experience was awful—but I don’t want that to scare you off for a few reasons. 

First, that was in the 90s and we have a better understanding and more meds available now to find what works. For me, it was my PCP giving us a script and changing it based on what I said. No one was around to help me navigate what was good from bad and what the actual *appropriate* dose and med was. 

Second, it was treated almost like a be all and end all solution. “Now that you have this med, it should be like you don’t have it at all!’’ And, of course, you yourself know that’s not the case and can help with other mechanisms too. 

Lastly, even though I was improperly medicated for so long, the meds still did have their positive effects, even though I experienced outsized ill effects—they were not *all* bad even if they were *too* bad. 

Since you’ll be able to help mitigate those, and you’ll be more keen to how he/she is responding, I believe it could be worth it.","gjlqkln",2,1610898466,"2021-01-17 15:47:46"

"1502","I too was the smart but lazy kid my entire life, and was not diagnosed ADHD until adulthood. Pulled a 4.3 in HS and a 3.8 in college with almost zero studying, which also makes me feel like a conceited ass to say, but I got my comeuppance hard in grad school. 

I was doing well in the first 2 years, more class-based portion of the PhD, but once the research/comps phase hit, I failed spectacularly. Some comments by my PI were what led me to suspect ADHD, and when I got diagnosed and started on Adderall I had the typical scales-fell-from-my-eyes limitless guy phase, for once feeling like I could succeed. In retrospect, I see that this was just the initial euphoria, but since I was still lazy and doing nothing to help the ADHD other than ingesting Adderall, I was only prolonging the inevitable.  

Ended up failing my comps exam because I didn't turn it in on time, and am now struggling to even finish a master's thesis, while my peers who were so jealous of my exam scores early on are now PhDs. All I can think about is that if I'd learned to just put in the effort, all this could have been avoided, but that is the problem with being able to get away with the smart but lazy and distracted thing for so many years.","egd763p",1,1550038969,"2019-02-13 06:22:49"

"1513","(I originally wrote an (even more) wall of text. Let me know if you have any questions, I‘ll gladly answer them)

22m from Switzerland, got into programming since it‘s a family thing and I‘m also a naturally curious and creative person. I like to figure out the logic behind things and create similar things based on that logic.

I mostly (seriously) worked on websites and online ads. „Simple“ websites are fun to do from time to time. Online ads were cool too since I was challenged to compress media (such as images) as much as possible, do cool css or svg animations in as few kilobytes as possible. Most serious work where I work involves using frontend frameworks like react, angular, vue, or lately svelte, to display user interfaces in webbased apps. Also, lots of data validation and configuring databases. This is can unfortunately be repetitive and I find it boring.

I privately love graphics programming, like working with opengl in c++ (currently learning). I also love to combine art with programming, like generative art or stochastic (computer generated music) or procedural terrain (computer generated landscapes) or anything at all really. I mostly love using low level languages such as C or C++ because I can do everything exactly how I want, it‘s efficient and it encourages me to write efficient and „perfect“ code.

I can only suggest checking out programming to adhd people, especially if you‘ve got a strong hyperfocus. Just don‘t burn out ;)","g19bwxc",1,1597267495,"2020-08-12 21:24:55"

This isn't a great trait, but sometimes I have to interrupt him and tell him, ""I get it, please move on with your point"" or else I'll lose my mind. I absolutely hate repetition because it makes me lose focus. There is already so much repetition and activity in my brain that listening to repetitive things makes me really angry and frustrated.

"1518","My psychologist said that while ADHD never truly goes away, by adulthood we create mechanisms to live with the symptoms of ADHD. Some of these coping mechanisms are just fairly harmless shortcuts such as always making microwave meals to avoid cooking, but some can become obsessive or fuelled by anxiety. 

I suppose too, that ADHD is on a spectrum, so you may be a very high functioning ADHD and therefore aren't too troubled by your symptoms. 

I think I've always wanted to change and always wanted to work, I don't like the common assumption that ADHD is essentially not wanting to do those things. You can't overcome your brain's physical deficiency by trying to be more motivated about it. I do agree though, that if you don't want to do something, no amount of ritalin is going to make you want to do it. But ADHD isn't about just not wanting to do stuff, it's about not having the physical tools to be able to do something. ritalin can give you the ability to focus but it's still up to you to use that focus on the right tasks. Probably most people could do with some counselling to help with motivation, but I don't think as a general rule, ADHDers are unmotivated, they just lack the tools to apply that motivation.","dbycziv",1,1483470428,"2017-01-03 19:07:08"

And I also started noticing how people around me say things like “I’m so dumb” or “I can’t do anything right” super frequently. I think that because we experience rejection in such a dramatic way we spend most of our lives trying to feel normal and to have someone, even if it’s yourself, telling you that you’re doing ok and giving you unconditional support really changes the way you live your life.","ekb3tk5",4,1554638184,"2019-04-07 11:56:24"

"1532","Luckily for me I've managed to stumble from one thing to another throughout the early part of my career. Eventually reality caught up with me though and I found myself in a really bad spot, with a resume that was so incoherent that my chances of finding a decent paying job were all but wishful thinking. 

I ended up starting my own business out of pure despair. It was tough and I hit my head a lot. Eventually it paid off though. I wish I had done that 20 years earlier. Being responsible for my own creation. Keeping customers happy, employees busy and managing and planning cash flow, inventory, production is a constant challenge and through it I suffer far less from my ADHD than I did working 9 to 5. 

Everybody is different, but in my experience being self employed helps. I think it is because the consequences of procrastinating and avoiding social interactions translate immediately into your wallet. So if you want to make rent, you better get off your ass. 

It works for me at least. Even on really bad days I get stuff done, simply because I have to.

You can be a genius and have ADHD, or not.

You can be an idiot (literal term, here) and have ADHD, or not.

Going off what you've said in the rest of your post, though, I agree that you were probably settings off flags that should have led to you being tested sooner than you were. I'm in much the same boat as you in that regard, but it simply comes down to the fact there's nothing to do about it, now.

A lot of people show that the kinds of tests that I did often do not showcase the actual issues that people have with ADHD, and looking at them functioning in real life is a much more appropriate diagnostic test. Therefore, interviews with parents and teachers are better.

Personally, my main issue (working memory) is really easily highlighted in the psychoanalysis tests while seeing it in my everyday life would have been impossible up to the age of 19 or so because I had really, really, really good support and scaffolding around me in addition to general high intelligence. Sure, I cannot add two 2-digit numbers in my head, but that's no biggie - I just write it down, and my mom always asked about my homework every day after school and if I had it in my backpack every morning, and I was never hyperactive.

Flunking two master's programs and two careers... Well that's when it started to show.

So I guess my overall thoughts are sometimes it's obvious with interviews. Sometimes it's obvious with tests. I think the most accurate would obviously be everything all together. ","e4e3t2z",5,1534561005,"2018-08-18 02:56:45"

"1572","Links to and mentions of ADDitude are not allowed on /r/adhd because we feel they have demonstrated themselves to be untrustworthy and that they, despite soliciting donations from people with ADHD to fund their operation, prioritize profit and advertising dollars over our best interests. Their website is full of articles promoting the use of homeopathy, reiki, and other unscientific quack practices. They also have had articles for Vayarin (a medical food that is now no longer sold in the US because its research was bunk) that suspiciously looked like stealth advertisements (which is highly unethical and illegal in the US).

We also find it problematic that their medical review panel includes not only legitimate doctors and psychologists, but also (at the time of writing) one practitioner of integrative medicine, which combines legit medical practice with pseudoscience and alternative medicine. They have previously had other quacks on the panel as well.

"1663","First, understand that the social world is 98% imposter based. We connect through our ideas of each other and ideas of ourselves. Even the project of getting ""authentic"" relationships is an ideal some people have and like to project. There is nothing wrong with this. It is something you have to go through to get into the 2% no false barriers moments in a relationship. 

With that in mind, there is a wonderful old book entitled *How to Win Friends and Influence People.* by Dale Carnegie. It has been in continual print for about 80 years now. My dad got me to listen to the audiobook version in high school and it helped me immensely. I gave me the tools to make the friends I want to make. It is well worth a read, and worth putting into practice.

The other thing that is important as an adult is getting out and being around people. It doesn't have to be at bars or clubs, but find a group that meets up regularly to do something you like doing. It doesn't even have to be a hobby. For me, I enjoy spirituality, so I attend a Christian church, a Buddhist sangha, and an interfaith book study on a (more or less) regular basis. The internet, your local paper, and sites like meetup.com are your friends here, if you are looking for groups doing particular things. Once you start talking to people in one group you will find other opportunities and events as well. Then it is just a matter of picking and choosing what you want to do and who you want to hang out with and how much. If you are in gradschool at the school itself, there are going to be *a LOT* of groups and social opportunities for all kinds of interesting things.  ","dcdkkzi",3,1484318425,"2017-01-13 14:40:25"

"1675","I’m typically considered high performance.

My back story is similar to yours, except with a touch of obsessiveness towards many topics. I’m accomplished in music, for example, by others standards. However, I’m never content with my abilities. In childhood, my teachers insisted I was bored with the subjects. I eventually went to law school and graduated. I’m a younger individual in my early 30s, but I had a previous career in technology doing programming.

I have never considered myself high performance until recently. I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago after practicing a couple of years. After much skepticism, I’m beginning to accept my diagnosis. I struggled with accepting that i had ADHD, when I’ve passed law school and the bar exam unmedicated and sans diagnosis. The diagnosing doctor indicated that I may have learned to self treat the condition through adaptive functioning. I’d use learning new skills and problem solving for dopamine kicks, he insisted.

While I’m becoming more open to the diagnosis, I still have a lot to learn. However, I relate to most in that I do get bored with mundane tasks easily, which complicates certain (I.e., non-litigation) aspects of this profession. 

So, while I don’t consider myself high performance, much of my life I have been overworking myself out of necessity. I have two speeds, off and full throttle. I’ve learned to exist in full throttle, but I’m learning it’s not healthy. My next phase is learning to self-regulate so I can learn to slow down and still function at half throttle.

Brintillix to my understanding is a newer antidepressant and is known for not having sexual or sleep side effects. The worst common side effect is an upset stomach, but is supposed to go away if it does occur.

 Another downside is it is quite expensive considering it is a newer drug. Currently I'm on a free trial and feel like I may stick with this one.

They are not medical professionals, I'm Irish and believe me for the most part we know fuck all about mental health. There is no proper resource for them to know how to deal with this and it isn't their fault, it's difficult for them, and it's difficult for me.

"1703","I'm on Vyvanse 40mg, and I definitely found that each time we upped my dosage, my appetite would take a nosedive all over again. I don't usually count calories, but I found it helpful to do so after each medication increase, just to make sure that I was eating enough. I definitely still lost weight, but not a massive amount - maybe 12lbs total (which, for the record, I'm 5'1, started off 130lbs, so 12lbs of weight lost was still pretty significant). I also work in the skilled trades, so I find I need to eat a fair bit to keep myself going.

However, I've now been at the same dosage for over a year, and in that time my appetite has somewhat returned to normal, and I've crept back up to 130lbs, though my body fat percentage is down quite bit.

Have you had your Vitamin D3 levels checked lately?  

ADHD isn't treated with supplements with any real efficacy greater than placebo, at least not proven with significance.  

So if you believe your Dr is wrong, seek a 2nd opinion. However be prepared to accept the 2nd decision if it to is negative.

I had always managed to slide by - mind you, that usually involved accommodations from teachers and EXTREME procrastination - but I still put on a great front. 

Being properly diagnosed and medicated changed everything. My anxiety was well-controlled for the first time in my life. I never experienced any of the side effects typically associated with stimulants. I had to take an 8 year hiatus from treatment due to pregnancy/breastfeeding. Restarting medication was just a helpful the second time around. The anxiety that had plagued me in previous years was manageable again! I sleep better when I am medicated as well.

"1790","3rd year engineering major here, the amount of students in my classes who completely flopped their first and even their second years would probably surprise you.  Almost everyone has failed something (lets exclude the 4.0GPA kids).

You can pull through this.  Here are my tips.

1. Speak to your profs, swallow your pride and admit you are disorganized and overwhelmed.  If they are good profs they will help you out a bit.

2. Prioritize, how much is each thing worth? Try to get the stuff thats worth the most as complete as possible and try to hand in *something* for the lesser stuff.  Anything is better than a zero.

3. Chat with you peers.  My year has a group chat on messager where we exchange notes, complain about classes, say we dont understand things etc.  I promise you, you are not the only one who is overwhelmed.  If you need notes or an answer to a seemingly stupid question, just ask.  My experience is that people are nicer than you'd expect.

4. Withdraw, if you are really in a bind then pick the classes that would be the simplist to withdraw (non-prerequisites) and cut your losses.  I had to do this for a 1st year course in my 3rd year, it sucks, but you dont want to get an F. Every school functions a bit differently though, so make sure you see an advisor to make sure its the right choice.

5. Forgive yourself, 1st year is hard.  Its a massive transition and very much a sink or swim situation.  You now know that you are sinking, its good that you found this out 1st semester of 1st year so you can work on it now instead of later.  You will get through this.  Your grades do not determine your worth.

6. Kind of hinted above, nip this in the bud.  Go see campus resources.  Do you get accomodations?  Would they help if you had them? Would it help to see an academic planner? Or maybe a counsellor? Are there resources on campus for people with ADHD? 

7. Breathe, take a second, sort out your study area, get some water and a snack.  Maybe stretch and be comfortable.  Maybe some ambient music would help? Dont do all nighters if you can help it.  Your body needs sleep to function properly.

On that note Im going to take my own advice... goodnight","f9pfmc8",1,1575533579,"2019-12-05 08:12:59"

"1856","I'll give a counterpoint. I suspect that the people who respond on this sub tend to have more serious ADHD than the average person with ADHD. That would tend to bias the responses towards medications being necessary.

I just explored with my provider if I should discontinue my previous medication, Vyvanse. I was having some side effects I didn't like, and I wasn't certain about the magnitude of the therapeutic effect. (Side note: All medications are a trade off between therapeutic effects and side effects, and that trade off varies for each individual.) We settled on Adderall as needed.

In particular, I'm not sure how good my concentration is either on or off medication. I've had very focused days both on and off medication. I've had very unfocused days on and off medication as well. My time management is not a total disaster, and I can study when I'm interested in the material. That inconsistent interest, focus, and discipline is a hallmark of ADHD. I'm not sure if medication was helping me, particularly in the interest and discipline bit (although it may help the focus).

Not being American I hadn't really had nacho cheese (as in liquid cheese) and I tried to make some following a recipe but something went wrong and instead I just made a cooked lump of cheese and whatever else went into the recipe. 

We had hotplates on our old stove that heated up but didn't have fire (so it wasn't visually obvious it was on). Forgot I had turned it on for something and left it on, then sat a plastic bowl on the hotplate as though it was normal bench. It melted onto the hotplate.

You can set up a timer for each task, their order and the time it needs to be over by so you are ready on time for work or else. 

When you finish a task you just have to swipe it left. Can’t do the task right now? Swipe right and it will go to the queue and show back up later.

We do a white elephant-style gift exchange for the extended family members. Everyone sits around the living room and brings a gift for their gender. Some arbitrary order is made up [age, hair length, etc] and it goes in order according to that. The person currently on the spot has the choice between an unopened gift and a gift another has already opened and has in their possession. It tends to be better this way, as shopping for every family member only ever gets thoughtless gifts like mittens or candles. This way each person can spend up to $25 or make something for under that price for any family member of their gender. 

Last year my aunt (who recently lost her son [prior marriage, quite older than me and not blood related] to what I am assuming was AIDS, at which point she became very depressed and withdrawn) made an amazing afghan by knitting or crocheting (I can't remember), and this year I am not letting her steal the show.

"1896","&gt;This relates in that I feel that stimulants are only a good tool in the short run for ADHD. In the long term the goal should be to develop a set of behaviors for yourself that remove the need for them

Again, do you realize this is squarely against the scientific and medical consensus on treatment?

&gt;I feel that people who merely take stimulants but don't use the focus they gain to learn how to focus more naturally are hurting themselves in the long run.

It depends - some people might be fine with just coping tools, but the vast majority of people will need to be on stimulants for life to see consistent results across their lifespan.

&gt;I'm not sure about this, but maybe it has something to do with the stimulants setting up the brain to focus on setting up behavioral patterns - which is good, if those patterns are healthy.

No - it stops once people are off them. It had to do with the stimulants affecting people with ADHD in ways that people without it aren't effective - specifically by treating the underlying neurological problem.

&gt;I'm saying that many of the symptoms could be alleviated through behaviors - mostly getting proper sleep, exercising, eating at appropriate times, and avoiding mind altering substances.

They really couldn't. ADHD is a *mental disorder* - you have to treat the underlying problem *with the brain itself*. Proper sleep and exercising might be helpful for secondary problems, but they won't fix traumatic damage to the executive functioning capability of the human brain.

&gt;I feel the brain is only broken because we live in a society that is not conducive to an ADHD brain.

There are environmental concerns (all medical problems are relative to environment), but for everyone beyond borderline or minor status they are just not possible. They *need medication* to have any real chance of treating the underlying neurological problems.

You seem to be acting as if ADHD is like being disorganized, or only exists at a very borderline spectrum. It's not - it's a *mental disorder*. It robs people of agency, fundamentally affects the very structure of their brains, and is almost inescapable without altering the structure of their brains through chemicals. Certain people with minor symptoms might be able to adjust their environment enough that they can stop taking stimulants and not see a dramatic fall in performance, most will not be able too.","cczq9e2",7,1382745628,"2013-10-26 00:00:28"

Most meds cause you to be increasingly social, and less bitchy as your emotional instability is controlled and you are able to socialise better. But it will also make impulsivity easier to deal with, so if you are prone to doing EVERYTHING your friends say you will end up with more self control and probably less likely to say, go to the bar when you have a flight at 6 am.

Basically I'm paying the amount of a new car.  Started process in February, still not done.  Others might have proceeded faster, but it's still not a quick process. I'll spare you details of pain, however will mention that I've been to the dentist more than 20 times this year - a number of the visits were emergency visits because temporary bridges often broken or came off because of challenging overall dental situation being addressed.

I'd been diagnosed with bruxism years ago, but didn't like wearing the mouthguard and would often just plain forget about it.  I'd ask my husband if I was grinding my teeth at night, and he said no, so I figured it was ok to do without it.  I'm actually surprised that my dentist of 8+ years didn't say anything to me about it that I can remember.  I'd been diagnosed with bruxism much before that.

Lots of great advice in this thread re magnesium.  Didn't notice anyone mention using epsom salts in bath as another means to absorb magnesium and calm down.

Imagine for a second that you're watching a really good movie/series, reading a really good book, or trying to meditate. But every five minutes someone tells you to stop, look at a meme, answer an inconsequential question, or anything that prevents you from enjoying what you're doing.

Imagine that, but for everyday tasks. It takes three times as much energy to focus on doing the dishes, folding the laundry, and other tasks. So when someone interrupts that focus, its the same reaction as someone has when their movie is interrupted. Except 3 it's times as jarring, and because we have expended more energy to focusing on the task, there might be enough energy to actively regulate the emotions, so frustration may occur.

"1952","1. We don't know the whole picture. It's a risk. Any medical treatment you pursue is a risk. You have to ask yourself if the risk is worth the potential benefits. The problem is that it's hard to see the benefits. When you are depressed, you can't imagine happy. When you are anxious, calm doesn't compute.

2. On my first visit to my pdoc, she gave me klonopin. And I was there because of irritability and because I suspected I was on the spectrum. She brought up anxiety and I agreed that I am an anxious person. She said, ""We can't do anything until we get your anxiety under control.""

First visit. And I wasn't asking for help with anxiety. I was a bit annoyed that she wasn't addressing the issue I came to her with. But it was amazing. The first time I took it I felt like I was on heroin but it very quickly got to the point where I couldn't tell I was even on it.

For a long time, every once in a while, I would think there was something missing. Then I would realize the missing thing was the overwhelming feeling of vague, pointless dread. I got so used to it, I had just started seeing it as a part of me.

3. If you tell your family about your issues and the treatment you pursue and they see you get better, won't that make them more likely to seek treatment themselves? I don't see a moral quandary here at all.

4. What would you say depressed feels like, though? It's not sadness, you know? Grumpy, tired, drained, are all symptoms of depression as is insomnia.

"1961","I've definitely had this problem throughout my life. The other night I was texting my girlfriend and because it was over text I was able to offer her the emotional support that she needed at the time but I definitely would not have been able to offer the same support with my verbal communication. My ideas are often all over the place and I often have trouble explaining what I really mean to say. Often times I will also find myself slurring my words as well, and for me, I ended up automatically converting to making a joke about it. For example I will mutter gibberish for about 5-6 seconds, and greatly exaggerating the slur in speech after it starts and make wild movements. This gives my brain the ability to reset and I can say to the other person ""Oh my gosh, I can't speak. What was I even trying to say?""  However, I mostly use that on my girlfriend so looking back she might just laugh out of politeness. I'm also younger, so I find it to be more acceptable at my age, often times I can't do this around people I don't know very well. So even if that method doesn't work for you I definitely think that there is still some hope for you man, even at your age. /u/AndHereItIs889922 provided some better advice for both of us. I just wanted to share my experience so that you could maybe relate, obviously we're in very different situations but you're just human.

&amp;#x200B;

Something my counselor taught me is to refer to a list of good things about yourself whenever you might beat yourself up, and you could do that if you slur your words. For me personally, my thought process is generally something like, ""God damn it, I am such a terrible procrastinator. Why do I do this to myself? I just have no impulse control and I'm a terrible person."" So I'll counter it with some things on my list, ""Hey, I'm not supposed to be good at everything, and I should be grateful that I am gifted with a naturally high intelligence. Yeah, I definitely have problems in school and displaying this to other people, but that's okay. I can't be good at EVERYTHING, that would just be crazy."" Your post was very eloquent and well written, so you could do something along the lines of ""Hey, I can't speak very well but I do have great strength in my written communications."" Having a speech impediment doesn't make you unlikable. Think about it, have you ever looked at someone who stutters rarely and went ""Wow, they stutter sometimes?? I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH THEM!"" Of course not, chances are, you are much more annoyed with it than anybody listening to you is. The tool I mentioned honestly helped my depression immensely and understand I'm a human. Obviously I had to take the effort to apply it to my life, and the lethargy was still there, but I definitely improved and made a step in the right direction. Hopefully it can be a good tool for you too.

Can you back these statements up with actual studies?

Because one person's anecdotal experiences is not at all indicative of any sort of trend.  Studies need to be done to confirm positive effects for a larger number of people as well as to confirm minimal negative side effects.

My combined depression and adhd caused me to spiral down and I did terribly in school. I would try to study and would just stare doing nothing or distract myself my doing something else then cry because I just couldn't make myself do it even though I know I had to. It was awful and I empathize. The adhd meds weren't always enough for me as I needed structure in my environment too.

Personally, once I found a job I liked for a summer internship I noticed a huge difference. The fact that I liked what I was doing made it so much easier to focus get things done. Liking my work combined with both the  adhd and depression meds made me feel unstoppable and I excelled. The resulting confidence after realizing that I actually could succeed really helped too.

I also tend to trouble sleeping and tend to oversleep; fortunately, management is a bit more flexible with my schedule so it's not really an issue since I work my ass off when I'm there and I tend to stay later or work from home occasionally.

Confrontation in itself is not always a bad thing.  It's through confrontation and conflict that we are able to improve and grow as people and running away never solves the problem.  Instead of leaving, I would first suggest to patch things up with your best friend.  It doesn't sound like you have many relationships, so holding on to those close ones is absolutely vital.  Having a support system and being close to those that understand you will help tremendously.

My second suggestion is much easier said than done.  Try finding a position with an employer that is okay with you being occasionally late or allows for a flexible schedule.  Some won't care as much as long as you still put in your 40 hours or the work is still getting done.

So emotional volatile, work a holic, inattentive and he becomes cruel if he feels threaten or critized due to self esteem problems making him defecsive and a defensive impulsive ADHD person is the worse.

My mom was the opposite of ADHD in everything though she had some ocd and anxiety traits, which was passed down to me and two siblings out of four kids. For her trying harder worked.  She was amazing in some things and hell with other she did not get how her obsessive logistics and the ability to self motivate did not work with her kids.

She wore her self out though and her stress was felt in us kids, she tried to hide it but we kids absorb it.  The best thing she could do to help is help us kids express our feelings.  Kids have problem modulating their feelings, adults get this skill in the late twenties.  It is worse with adhd.  Your executive system has many brain loops but one loop is the frontal limbic loop, it is the loop where our frontal lobe bring talks to our emotional system and vice versa.  Well ADHD people have delay and under activity in the frontal lobe so ADHD people can not self soothe.  When we angry we can not calm down, we can not stop our impulses, we can not motivate, and when we feel sad and broken we get stuck in this feeling, the word for this is ruiminate, we can not look at the sitituition and realize we only see half the picture and thus realize we should not feel sad.  Ruiminate long enough and you feel broken.  OCD makes this much worse

By making a safe place where your kids can share their feelings you can be their frontal lobe and help motivate them and show them they are not broken.

I tend to have a very hard time communicating my thoughts into words (specifically when dealing with emotional content; I can talk about logical problem solving all day without feeling “boxed in” is the best way to describe it). And I often feel like my words are used against me and I get easily flustered and frustrated trying to explain myself. I’m often then accused of being defensive, stubborn, and argumentative.

I’ve been attributing this to ADHD, as my thoughts are constantly running on overdrive (was just recently diagnosed), and I also feel like it’s gotten better since I started taking Wellbutrin off-label (another reason why I’d attributed it to ADHD).

Everyone can give you their tips and tricks to get through the day with adhd but you will need to find your own. So like I said try the weekends off meds (unless you have tests or papers to write for school) and make a log of what you go done and what you needed to get done and reflect on  what you could do to help you bridge that gap. Slowly try new things and see what works for you and what doesnt. Once you do that for a while and can function to your set expectations play around with lowering your dosage.

and you say there’s no long term research, are you aware that these medications have been used since the 1930s... there are people who have been using these drugs for decades, we know they’re safe (at least when taken under a guidance of a GP)... and I would argue that for people with ADHD taking medication *is* the healthiest route because it corrects a neurotransmitter inbalance","dqbo1he",2,1511631707,"2017-11-25 17:41:47"

If you have been on the same dose a while (month/s) and have not tried a higher dose, it would not hurt to ask your doctor about it.

If it is not right for you, you can always go back down. This happened to me:

Let's skip non-concerta history... I started 36 mg after switching from Ritalin LA. I felt as you do that there was something there, but I was unsure if it were enough. 

I (with my doctor) decided to try 54mg. I felt amazing. Only issue was, it was impossible for me to turn off. My husband got his ear talked off in the evening when he was trying to sleep. I fell asleep, if I did, at 3 in the morning, but still was up at 7 since the meds helped me get up. I managed to get things done easily, and it felt amazing , but on the other hand I HAD to get things done.

I then got to try 45mg to try to find a middle-ground. Tho this dose does not exist so I take 36+18. It worked for a while, but I still really miss the positive effects of 54mg. Also, I've just started considering asking to switch back to 36 since, even tho I've a harder time doing stuff and don't feel as good, I have the tingling back making it hard to sit still, almost worse than when unmedicated.

No one's medication trend is straight forward. That's why meds are tried out for the individual patient, ADHD-meds especially.","g1pwp7m",3,1597566721,"2020-08-16 08:32:01"

"2128","This is absolutely the right attitude to have, and a great outline for how to approach our wide range of ""rapid obsessive interests"".

To add another layer on what you've outlined, I also find that having done a ton of different hobbies has it's own benefit, which is that of cross-discipline knowledge. 

My short interest into photography gave me insight into how to frame a shot, which in turn allowed me to get some great pictures using only a cell phone camera while pursuing my hobby of long distance hiking (thus, saving the weight of possibly bringing a larger camera). My hobby of crafting/painting D&amp;D miniatures exposed me to many crafting materials and adhesive techniques, which I've been able to apply to countless little projects that I would otherwise have no idea how to tackle (and since they were small non-exciting projects, they probably would have just gone a box somewhere and never been fully realized). My electronics hobby and 3D printing hobby feed my home automation hobby, etc. 

Not to mention that a wide variety of hobbies has left me with a wide variety of tools, which allow me to work on other new hobbies without as much overhead in equipment (this obviously depends a lot on the hobby, an unused kayak in your garage obviously has less alternative uses than an unused drill)

As for OPs fear of trying a new hobby, I had my own struggle with that.

For me personally, prior to my diagnosis (as well as prior to my anxiety meds), I always felt this ""pressure of potential"", like, I knew if I really applied myself, I could be good at any number of things, but I was paralyzed by fear of picking the ""wrong thing"" to focus on. My anxiety and ADHD put me in the position of finding flaws in things I was interested in to preemptively avoid any negative judgement for being interested in those things (or in not being immediately good at doing those things).  This habit likely saved me a bunch of money over the years, but it also didn't leave me with a very fulfilling life. When I don't have an active hobby or interest to work on, I just fall into the rut of watching TV to fill all my free time, which just leads me to feeling depressed because my life becomes work and TV.

Once I found the right medication to help with my anxiety, ""being productive in my free time"" went from feeling like dragging myself through a tiny crawl space to instead feeling like walking down the hall... suddenly I felt like I could just take on a project and it no longer mattered if it was perfect or not. I built a giant can rotator to fit in our hall closet, I smushed a couple different designs together and banged most of it out in a single weekend. Something of that scale previously felt overwhelming... or it would have taken me months to get around to finishing it. 

Of course, now that the anxiety is lessened, I sort of wound up filling that void with way too many projects... but at least I seem to be rotating around through the same hobbies at this point, instead of finding a new one every few months.

The one other tip I have for OP, is if you really want to ""stick with"" a new hobby, try to find a group/team activity. Meetup.com is great for this, you can try new things, usually for free, and if it's something you like, you've already found a group to do it with. I find this especially useful for my ""stick-to-it-ness"", because if I have a weekly/monthly thing that I do with that group, it's much easier for me to stay interested in the hobby, because there are other people involved and there's a dedicated time for that interest.","fb8wkw3",1,1576623550,"2019-12-17 22:59:10"
"2129","&gt;So I met a girl who also has pretty debilitating adhd. We've already hooked up but her quirkiness and understanding is what makes me want to actually date her, aside from how well we clicked. I've been avoiding seriously dating anyone this last year because of a string of failures. 

&gt;All my past relationships have been with girls who are pretty typical, some atypically excellent at life which breeds frustration toward me. My memory problems and time management have always been at the brunt of issues in relationships.

It wasn't until about 3 years ago, while going through the process of having my own son evaluated that my mom gave me all of my childhood medical records and while looking through it I found my diagnosis.

I still have not been treated for my own ADHD, but my son has and in working with the school I made sure that all the people on his team knew that I also had it. It meant that in many cases where you have a parent that can provide the strict structure to help a kid with ADHD to function, In our case that wasn't possible no matter how hard I tried so the teachers had to try other methods.

We had a couple of younger teachers who were really good about trial and error for success for my son and I, and others who had been teaching long enough that they were just set in their ways and it was all on us to ""just focus more"".

I occasionally have to remind myself to check in with the nonverbal cues, but I do ok when medicated. Perhaps you could do the reverse and remind yourself to return to the actual talking? I know that might not work, so I find what helps is polite apology like,""I'm sorry, I got sidetracked by the first thing you said, could you repeat that?"" Or the old standby,""My hearing isn't that great, could you say that again?"" On occasion apologizing for having an off day works too, if you don't abuse it.","cavokor",7,1372915578,"2013-07-04 05:26:18"
"2163","Yeah the college board is insane about SAT testing and way harder than schools and colleges are about getting diagnosis. 


That's because they're on a larger scale and can't have everyone going to a doc pretending to have ADHD symptoms etc etc to get help on the test. They are harder than colleges too because colleges work more closely with your child and want to help them, but the collegeboard wants to protect themselves and the test's integrity and reduce cheating. Different motivations. 


I just quickly read the colleheboard's webpage on accommodations and they need way too much stuff, including teacher's recommendations, the specific tests used to identify ADHD... geez. 


Neuropsych tests are detailed and will probably give collegeboard all they need. It'll be pages and pages of information based on a bunch of tests that are different for each person based on what you complain about when you talk to the neuropsych test admin person. That makes it sound cool but it's really not any different from most psychological tests, its pen and paper or computerized stuff, it might require your child to do some tasks with their hands etc. and then they give you the results in paragraph format and tell you what it all means. 


The neuropsych tests will usually also want parents, teachers, other docs seen for ADHD to consult and developmental history and the test is really long, usually more than one day and I don't think most insurances cover it, which sucks! At least mine doesn't. The goal is to be comprehensive and cover everything, if you get the neuropsych test you should leave with no doubt whatsoever what the diagnosis is, in theory anyway.","di4i6yk",1,1495919474,"2017-05-27 21:11:14"

A lot of people who are ""confident and happy with life"" have put a lot of effort into acting confident and actively practicing gratefulness for the good things life has given them, or the good things they've made for themselves. Start to notice things, even little things (skills, traits, whatever) that you are confident about in your life and that you are interested in. Try to consciously develop those things. Also when something is good, try to take a moment to appreciate it: https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/04/17/if-this-isnt-nice-what-is-kurt-vonnegut-commencement/

You've taken the time to post this, so you're probably not as lazy and unmotivated as you think. Also, don't worry, lots of cool people are also socially awkward. The best way to deal with social anxiety and awkwardness is just to straight up tell people ""I'm socially awkward"". If they are good people they will help you out, or they might say ""me too!"". Stay connected to the good people. If they are bad people they might make fun of you for it. Ditch the bad people.

On the relationship front: do you like this girl? If you definitely like her, tell her. You can tell her directly (""I think you're great/nice/lovely/whatever"") or you can make it obvious that you like her, by asking her out on a date: go see a movie or go for coffee or go bowling or ice skating or go to a party or a concert or whatever you like to do. No rush, take your time, and have fun.

P.S. Take my advice with a pinch of salt, but overall what I'm saying is things aren't as bad they seem - you've got good intentions and if you start to act on them things will work out.

* **Trello and recently moved to Clickup:** Trello was serving me well until recently as I am working on my business and my projects now require more organization. Either one allows me to look at the cards so I don't get lost in the details. It was and is a learning process. I am always improving them. I also like that I can add labels and tags. 
* **Clockify**: I use Clockify, which integrates with Trello and Clickup to track how much time I spend on tasks including health. It is not perfect as sometimes I forget to track every task, but it helps me be aware of how I am doing. Clockify has Pomodoro which I used more regularly than now to chunk up my work and breaks.

I  start in one note in the morning and add any missing tasks to Clickup related projects. 

Not sure if this makes sense at all. It is a process and learning by trial and error and **reflection**.  Be kind to yourself as you explore various tools and approaches. No tool is perfect, and each tool is as good as we make it work for us.

Hands on learning and hands on ""direction following"" are different.

I decided to major in something fun, get a degree, and figure out the rest later.

I also had already gone to school for 2 years before I had to decide on a major.) 

If college is for you, then I'd suggest majoring in something broad that encapsulates a lot of your broad interests. I know it seems like nothing could connect the dots of your obsessions, but many of them are probably related to your obsessions.

My adopted ""female"" daughter was diagnosed with ADHD last year when she turned 5.  Why?  Because she is hyperactive.  

This article basically says females are inattentive, males are hyperactive.  It furthers this stereotype by relating estrogen to inattentive ADHD.  (I'm fairly certain my estrogen levels are in check.) I get that inattention is more often seen in females and hyperactivity is more common in males but they do occur in both genders.  To report it this way is inaccurate and misleading.  It does a great disservice to us males with inattentive ADHD those women with hyperactive ADHD.

I do get headaches now and then because of it, but it’s far better than a sore jaw from grinding. Please keep in mind, everyone is different and will react differently. Whatever your prescriber chooses, trust their expertise. Try it out and after a month tell them your experience, they’ll either switch you or keep you on it.","ghm38tm",1,1609429156,"2020-12-31 15:39:16"
"2217","I had a similar experience in high school. College is where the problems started. The demands get more complicated, and it can be a lot harder to just pull everything together at the last minute--especially if you don't have any clear ambitions or goals. If you don't have a central passion or interest, all you do is procrastinate and put out fires. 

Two suggestions. First, figure out what you're really interested in. What grabs your attention the most? What do you like doing in your free time? Then figure out a way to make that part of your career goals and integrate it into your education plans. For example, if you're really into video games, maybe you'd be a great game developer. Pursue a curriculum that helps you down that path--comp sci, business, design, etc. If you're pursuing something you love to do, the motivation is built-in. Second, find ways to automate project management and time management as much as possible. Many people report that they ""hit the wall"" when they got to college, after sailing through high school with little effort. The deficits in the ADHD brain's organizational and planning abilities can become a big problem when the demands on them get a lot more complicated. And that makes muscling through life on sheer brainpower alone harder and harder. 

Finally, I've been taking Vyvanse for a long time with good results. I take 70 mg/day. 30-40 mg seems like a pretty low dose for an adult-sized person (I assume you're 16-17, so basically an adult). MDs usually start at a low dose and increase it until they get the right effect. I'm betting 50 mg is about where you'll start noticing the benefits. ","d8aya7b",2,1475428088,"2016-10-02 17:08:08"

My idea of autism is shameful? I don’t think so. It’s realistic. Some people with autism lead extraordinarily challenging lives trapped in a world with which they cannot communicate, a life of self injury, incontinence, fits, and in many cases, their lives are short too. Too often, their parents and carers are underfunded and neglected too. That is my view of *some* people with autism. *Some*.

"2241","Over the counter melatonin's really only of great use for phase disorders. With delayed phase, a sufficient amount of the body's own melatonin to initiate sleep will kick in, just at the wrong time, so a supplement can take its place for a couple hours. More importantly, the body sees this happening and starts to adjust, because it interprets the new melatonin source as a light cue.

With Adderall-created insomnia a different thing is happening, or rather two: the presence of extra dopamine blocks melatonin production, while the presence of extra norepinephrine in receptors keeps body temperature and heart rate high, making sleep difficult until the amphetamine levels in your blood are too low to affect you further. Melatonin thus won't be of much help. Blue light and other measures designed to affect hormonal release times won't take care of the middle of the night waking problem, but will only help with getting to sleep. Melatonin shouldn't be taken in the middle of the night at all because it can fuck your phase up, a la jetlag - the body will interpret it as a second nightfall event.

Extra food and water would certainly help get rid of Adderall dregs, though not terribly quickly. The body also tends to get used to the new doses fairly quickly, so we often see insomnia side effects diminish or disappear after a few weeks.

Intuniv and clonidine work as offsets to stimulant-caused wakefulness. Taking your drug the second you wake helps, and setting an alarm, taking it, then falling right back asleep can work for some. Benadryl might be of help, but it can negatively affect sleep quality. ","crp58n7",1,1432927052,"2015-05-29 19:17:32"

Now that you mention it, I remember when you told me. I was in fact paying attention. Then I forgot. It didn't cross my mind again after that initial moment and maybe I told myself ""okay, I will do that when I get home from school"" or ""after I do this other thing you told me to do"" or maybe ""after this episode of SpongeBob."" I had every intention of doing this thing. I didn't ignore you. I didn't consciously choose to not do it. I forgot. It's a thing that happens to people. Yeah, it's not great. It's not a good excuse. I will now do this thing you told me to do, which I did at some point mean to get done. My apologies. I forgot. I am not lying to you.

Pisses me off when people call me a liar. I make it a point not to lie to people because I was called a liar a lot as a kid when I was in fact telling the truth. Maybe I come across as blunt at times and maybe I could have talked myself out of trouble by lying in some past situations, but I don't regret telling the truth. Even when I want to lie, like when people ask if I am okay, I will still tell them straight-up ""no, actually I am not okay."" I don't want them to offer to help me or ask me why I am not okay, I kinda just want them to be satisfied I answered their question and leave me alone. Sometimes they will leave me alone but maybe keep an eye on me. Sometimes they will offer words of kindness or sympathy. Sometimes they will try to get me to talk about it but all I have to say is the truth, which is ""I will be okay, but talking about it is not helpful for me at the moment. Thank you for caring, though. I will be okay, it may just take me some time and I might need to take a break for a few minutes to get myself together."" And that's all that needs to be said. Lying to people has never done me any good. I cannot say that telling the truth always helps me, either, but I at least won't be a liar. 

Sorry for the rant. It just pisses me off when I think about people calling me a liar for telling the truth.

You should also ask if you can take any assesments orally rather than written if you think that might help. This depends on the subject a little though how useful it is for grading purposes. Even if you can't do clock stops just extensions try and build your own structure into an assesment. Plan to work pomodoro style using your watch as a timer.

It is difficult to do this, especially for ADHD brains, which is why we need to externalize what motivates us, building our prosthetic environment.  It's not an immediate thing we just make, it's a building up of scaffolding around us over time that helps us to remember our path to success, whatever that may be (brushing your teeth in the morning, not forgetting where your keys are, driving safely, feeding yourself, meeting that deadline by breaking the big mean looking task into smaller manageable tasks that add up to beating the big mean looking task), etc.

Think of failures as losing a life in a video game, like Super Mario Bros.  You fall down a pit by accident, that's not the end of the game, that's just a 1-up lost, but now you know that pit is there and how to avoid it next time.

Okay, so that is A LOT of stuff you got going on. I don't blame you for being stressed and commend you for keeping it together for any amount of time!

You definitely did the right thing by requesting a doctor's appointment. I don't know much (well anything) about Norway's health care but I'm sure there must be therapists you can go to. They probably won't specialize in ADHD but they can help with dealing with all the stress and provide objective professional advice about work, family, life stresses. 

I know my mom sees one cause of all the stress with having to work, pay bills, take care of her aging parents + my dad's mom (he's a big help too tho), then making sure me and my sister are okay (even though we're adults but you know mom's...they never stop worrying about you). She doesn't have ADHD and isn't diagnosed w/ anything (that I know of) but she finds it helpful to simply talk to someone outside the situation. 

I find, simply writing it all out, maybe crying my eyes out for a bit, and sleeping helps like crazy. Taking a shower and writing little tasks I CAN do right now (so things I CAN control in my life) in my planner, then doing them makes me feel better until I can get to my doctor.

"2312","I mostly disagree. Of course ADHD is not a superpower, but it’s the box of tools you’ve been given to work with. It’s so much more productive to make the best use of the tools you do have instead of being upset about the tools you don’t. Used properly, hyperfocus, creativity, curiosity, and the willingness to drop everything and do something else are absolutely positives. It largely depends on how you approach it.

I’m open with people about where I am likely to work effectively and where I am not, and I enlist allies whenever possible. It’s amazing how easily people accept statements like “Planning is not one of my strengths but I’m very responsive in a crisis.” Instead of just admitting what you can’t do, you have identified a related strength you bring to the team. 

I hope you can make peace with your brain. There is no medication that can ever change its essential nature, so instead of exhausting yourself fighting it, it’s more productive long-term to learn how to work with it. I used to fight mine every day (and of course sometimes still do), but I am happier and more successful once I started focusing on what I’m good at (those ADHD “superpowers”) and stopped worrying so much about all the stuff I’m not.

Now I understand you were talking about legal classifications. Which makes perfect sense as that was the subject of the post. And as the other comments is about medical and social definitions I guess your comment is the only one on topic and therefor should instead be the top post :)
  
&gt;ADHD is not considered a legal disability. 
  
Which I guess is depending on the jurisdiction where you live. It is considered a disability by the Swedish Labour Court and the Work Environment Authority.
  
And relevant for the post is that is also considered a disability by the National Agency for Education and the Council for Higher Education, as well as the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Social Insurance Agency and the Public Employment Service.
  
So, my answer to OPs question is that it depends on where you live.
  
&gt;ADHD is a disability
  
It's even considered a disability [by the government](http://www.regeringen.se/artiklar/2017/01/adhd-viktig-aspekt-vid-overgangen-fran-anstalt-till-frihet/). And probably even by the King. Who by the way has a disability himself (dyslexia).","dptsj0m",1,1510697644,"2017-11-14 22:14:04"

If you want to succeed, it is simply a fact of life that we ADHDers have to learn how to try harder, but that perseverance is what puts us ahead when it really counts.

Now, you CAN do this, just don't expect it to be easy or to have a shortcut handed to you. The key is to DO. How many of the suggestions did you implement before deciding again that you CAN'T?

I'll give a quick example of breaking things down, but don't depend too much on other people. It won't get you very far.
________________________________

Get over the entirety of what you have/haven't done so far. 

Forget about what you can't understand. 

Write down anything you can remember. 

Uno, do, tres, quatro, etc. I would be willing to bet, you know more than you think you do and your stress is making you think you don't know anything.

Then move onto what you don't know, a little at a time. You have a week. That is plenty of time if you really want this.

Start with the basics:
verb endings are easy enough. 
All ""ar"" verbs end with one of the following:

* I = oy

* you = as

* we = amos

* you (formal) = ais

* they (plural)= an

Look at this sentence:

""Estoy muy feliz.""

Don't worry yet what it means, just figure out who it is talking about and which word is the verb.

Answer= Estoy is the verb because the ""oy"" ending is referring to me. Also, I can derive that the root verb is Estar because ""oy"" is an ending used for ""ar"" verbs.

The pronoun for I is commonly left out because the verb ending tells you who the verb is talking about.

now, I would be wiling to bet you actually already understood the entirety of that sentence without having to break it down.

* Estoy = I am
* Muy = very
* feliz = happy

Its been my experience that relationships are much more taxing on meds; I noticed behaviors more often, I'm quicker to anger and far more sure I'm angry for the right reasons, I sleep much less and eat much less. The people in my life were not ready for a more focused concentrated me, it was a lot of adjustment.

That being said, that's all med bullshit. The pills should help him assert and organize his emotions, not scatter them to a chaotic wind. After an adjustment of a week or two theres no excuse, especially for paranoia and secrets. The people that mattered before meds should matter now. If hes leaving no opening for communication, not even enough to ramp up to a come-to-jesus ultimatum, and is hiding his actions and money he may have come to the same conclusion you have already.

"2446","Some instances are more ""obvious"" - and some jurisdictions are backward as hell with old judges who shouldn't be on the bench anymore.  See: rapist Brock Turner's case, for example.

The issue isn't a potential ruling - if you have the money you can shop jurisdictions and get the ruling you want.  If you have the money you can fight a team of lawyers representing a company.  If you have the money, you can put together a solid case.  With money, you can appeal a shitty ruling and escalate to the next level of court.

"2471","Some thoughts: 

1. Take it a few minutes after eating, not WITH food, but after eating. If you haven't eaten, it makes you feel weirdly hollowed out, but you don't want to eat, and if you take it while eating it can make you nauseous. At least it did me.

2. It binds to protein. Eat a meal high in protein before consuming and it'll be absorbed better.

3. Drink plenty of water.

4. If you feel any side effects of depression/rage/anger etc, then talk to your Dr about your dosage. I was thrown onto Generic because in america insurance companies can make drug choices for patients instead of doctors and it made me depressed or too anxious. I'm on a higher dosage and doing better. 

5. If you get body tingles (the weird side effect ever) watch asmir videos, thank me later. 

6. Watch out for your liver. 

7. Don't be afraid to take laxitives if you need to.

8. After a month of taking it and your side effects don't go away (constipation, body tingles, thirst, etc.) talk to your doc. 

9. If you feel sleepy, take it before bed and you'll konk out faster than anything ever and wake up without being groggy. 

10. If you accidentally a dose, just take it the first time you remember it, it's not on a schedule like stimulants are and won't keep you awake at night.","dwc4nau",2,1522108340,"2018-03-26 23:52:20"

"2477","The first week is a spike of the effects of the drug, and then it tapers back down to a new normal. I've been on medication for a good half-year or so, and that new normal has been fairly consistent now that I have a consistent dosage.

First thing to realise is that the main thing medication will do for you is *create the opportunity* to improve your habits. Techniques and approaches that didn't work before will stick a little better, and you will start to see gradual improvement as you keep trying. It will not automatically, however, create a healthy relationship between yourself and the things you want to do.

I have a very important warning for you, especially if you are someone who has been told throughout growing up that you are not ""living up to your potential"", et cetera. Not sure if that's you, but it's common.

Here it is:

If you take medication, and find a good dosage, you will feel an improvement in your control over your attention. You will be strongly tempted after the first week to use this control to become a *more effective workaholic*. Do not do this. If you treat yourself as a machine that simply got faster, and use your newfound control to simply pile up more tasks, you'll eventually be just as overwhelmed as before.

You absolutely must make sure you use a good portion of your medicated time on self-improvement. Learn to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

Books I hit up after starting medication, in no particular order.

1. ""Fast Minds"" by Surman, Bilkey &amp; Weintraub. A good overview of ADHD, what it can look like, and some strategies. Good for if ADHD is a new concept to you.
2. ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns. Crash course in cognitive therapy. This will help you remain emotionally stable; a necessity for everything else. Start here if nowhere else.
3. ""Learning to Learn"" by Barbara Oakley. Crash course in learning theory. This will help you understand when to take breaks, how to revise efficiently, and how memories form. See also note below regarding Anki flashcards.
4. ""Getting Things Done"" by David Allen. Popular book on managing your tasks. Avoids common pitfalls regarding making and remaking to-do lists over and over again that can really frustrate the ADHD Brain.
5. ""Never Split the Difference"" by Chris Voss. A book on negotiation by a hostage negotiator. Very persuasive and gives generally good basics, though veers into anecdotal, speculative and sometimes manipulative. Good for helping you master the basics of effective communication and persuasion. Best taken in combination with the next book;
6. ""Feeling Good Together"", also by David Burns. Centered heavily on maintaining healthy relationships and conducting communication effectively. Much more research-oriented and friendly than the above, whilst being somewhat more dry and shying away from certain aspects and perspectives on negotiation. Very good for learning how to exist in good relationships.

Note regarding Anki: I had a fear of forgetting things and my progress reversing. One of my major habits has become making flashcards for things I want to retain and revising them on a spaced repetition schedule. This may help you study without fear of leaving things out. I use Anki software to do this, and recommend reading this article on how to build effective flashcards [http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html). I use flashcards to revise elements of the above texts consistently so that they're slowly internalised.","fimud9b",1,1582547257,"2020-02-24 12:27:37"
"2478","So I'm 27(F) now. Life has always been a bit of a struggle for me, but you manage you know? Or you try and I just hid the ADHD symptoms an went undiagnosed. I had anxiety. blah blah blah. The real shit begins when I was 20 (stick with me for a moment here), I moved to a new city, knew no one, did school full time, and worked a shitload for about just under four months, and then I couldn't work because I had pain in my big toe. Like a motherload of pain. Turns out it's arthritis. In my big toe. *At 20.* Also turns out it's lupus. So I couldn't walk for four months. Gained a bit a weight. When I could put weight on it I broke my ankle,....so you know shit is hard, gets better, that's totally how it went obviously.

Or I may have just given up, I mean like can't get out of bed with ADHD on a good day, sure as fuck aren't going to do with chronic pain and fatigue. Even if staying in bed is going to make both those things worse. Gaining over 130 pounds sounded like a good idea too. Wasn't leaving my bed much anyway. I stopped talking to everyone, literally, but my parents. I didn't have anything to say. So what was the point to anything anymore? I read something somewhere and it was like give it a year and try as hard as you can. You owe it to yourself. One year. Alright...except I didn't try really. I mean I did. I just didn't. you know? I think I went numb. And then it was a year but I didn't try my hardest and I just wanted a life. Not my life. But a life. So I doggy paddled I guess. There were little things, tv shows or books that just had something that was like a little air. And until now...SEVEN years later and it feels like waking up and seeing&amp;feeling this life I just abandoned &amp;wrecked. To wake up and  see friends I went to college with have jobs and then left those jobs for better jobs or got married or have kids. happy. posting happy shit on instagram.

And I want that. I want it so bad and how do I get from here to there? Beats me. But like...I can. You can. I started surrodning myself with stories besides the like normal ones you hear of 20s in media. Or I just started looking at real life stories there. I try really hard to avoid those old happy friends (for now). And if I literarlly have nothing left to lose, why not just try? Here's the thing, I don't know if I could get better. I'm diagnosed now with ADHD, which helps with things like doing whatever the fuck I need to help my lupus to actually get better and with extreme anxiety. So, that's better. So, what if like it could get better, better? and what if I could bite the bullet and do 21 year old shit at 28 or whatever, and I don't fucking hate it? I mean it could be fun, right? That's all I have, could be fun. But it's a lifeline thought that I just cling the fuck onto. Tomorrow I might need to find a new one.

I don't know if any of that helps you. It just always helped me to read about people similar or worse off.

There's a book that might really help you its called the Grief Recovery Handbook, it's not just for grieving lost loved ones but all of the things in life that cause grief, like grieving a life you cannot have.","ggqj8dh",1,1608675718,"2020-12-22 22:21:58"

"2497","From what I've gathered, usually they are. There are different parts to an IQ test, which I know isn't the most reliable thing, gives a very good general view at your intelligence. 

Using me as an example, I scored very superior overall on the WAIS-IV test, but my scores in the other categories were significantly lower than they should have been, which doesn't keep in line to my high score. This is a very prominent sign of ADHD and is one of the ways a psychologist will begin to make a diagnosis.

Now for someone who isn't as mentally gifted and scores average on the test, a psychologist would expect those subcategory scores to be around average, which might make a diagnosis harder to make if they truly have ADHD. Someone who is of average, or even way below average, intelligence, IQ wise, can still have ADHD.

For those scores, the psychologist expects the average person to be performing average, but if the really smart kid is performing way below the average kid, there's something wrong.

Now, generally, in the real world, nobody gives a crap about IQ. It's all about how you do in life. Someone who has an IQ of 90, but works hard in school and goes to college and pursues a career is considered more successful than the kid with an IQ of 167 who doesn't go to college or try very hard in life.

The more I read comments like those, the more I wonder if NTs think ADHD is a temporary thing like a broken arm? 

They also make cocaine/meth/speed comparisons because they don’t realize that the ADHD brain is physiologically different than a NT brain. Sure, to a NT brain, all stimulants are similar in their experience and for them, they can be addicting and Adderall can absolutely be a gateway drug... for THEM.

If only they could wrap their head around this concept of ADHD brains being measurably different. If only they could accept that an ADHD brain reacts very differently to a stimulant because it has a deficit that can’t be cured, only managed.

"2593","tl;dr: Define times at which you're supposed to be productive, and times at which you can be a complete slob. Disclaimer: I can't say for sure how much it's helped me, but I'm under the impression it's having at least a bit of a positive impact, at least mental health wise.

I've lived in semi-Covid mode for most of my life, and I have terribly little to show for it.

However, I've learned that constantly stressing over getting little or nothing done fixes exactly **zero** of anything. Now, the adoption of defined time slots correlates with me, I think, being slightly more productive than I used to be before that, but it also correlates with a good bunch of other stuff, so there's that.

However, the basic idea is this: You only get to stress over wasting the productive slots, which gives you down time, which, over time, you'll learn to enjoy with gradually less guilt. I also hypothesize that, by constantly guilt tripping oneself, one teaches the brain to never be satisfied with what one's doing right now - **in addition** to the usual inclination to get distracted that comes with ADHD, as a sort of mental health problem.

I find that that can manifest to a degree that even activities one deems ""the stuff one should be doing"" are laced with thoughts of other important things that should be done as well, producing feelings of guilt and dissatisfaction because it's not **the other** important thing that is being done right now, but **this** important thing.

There's no winning in that state of mind.

Personally, what I do is to divide the day into morning time, afternoon time and evening time, roughly. I usually consider the morning and afternoon productive time, and the evening ""whatever"" time. If you don't have a stable sleep schedule, you might want to try defining relative slots around your sleeping patterns (the only reason I'm able to maintain sleep stability is because I take Melatonin whenever it seems sensible).

Off the bat: It often doesn't work. As said, I'm not sure that it's really making me more productive, but I think it might be one of the things that have improved my mental health over the past couple of years. Again, there are too many correlations to say for sure, unfortunately. 

But this is the approach I'm suggesting based on my loose self-observations.

A small addition on the side: I've also adopted ""swooning"" over any blessing or success in my life and that particular day when going to sleep. I've also defined bed a complete safe zone, where I'm allowed to (try to) cast away **anything** at will, any problem, any negative thought (to the degree possible) anything that can even **remotely** wait (maybe turn off the stove if you all of a sudden remember you forgot that ;p).

That can be moderate stuff, like ""I've written two pages of my 30 page report"", or small stuff like ""I've cleaned the kitchen table! It's all shiny now @,@!!"", big stuff, of course xD, but even achievements in leisure activities, like, ""I've made a nice rail factory blueprint for blue science in Factorio \^o\^!!"".

With these things it's less about **what** you do, but how you approach it, in order to not pile on (more) mental health damage in **addition** to the ADHD struggles.","fpb4oq2",1,1588462045,"2020-05-02 23:27:25"

"2645"," it seems like you're eating a decent amount of food, though some people do need more with medication as your brain/body is working harder, but just saying that more as a side/general note for this.

what time do you take it at? When I was on adderall I was convinced that I could take it relatively late, especially since I was started on a low dose, but definitely had sleep problems (which for some reason took me a while to catch on to.) I tried taking it earlier and earlier as the problems persisted because, if not for early classes, I'd sleep until 11 or 12. I'm on vyvanse now which is longer lasting so it just amplified the need for this, but I had to make myself get on a ""normal"" schedule and take my pill by 9 at the latest. If you might not be taking it early enough but don't wake up early and don't want to, you can set an alarm for an earlier time, take your pill, and fall back asleep until you'd normally get up.

but everyone's different, some people can take them later and be fine while some people can be really sensitive to sleep and smaller changes whether it's medication or other things. It could also be something entirely different and what I've said is just my opinion and experience with adderall sleep issues. So of course talk to your doctor about it at the next appt. 

But if you're taking them early, it's still happening and you aren't getting any sleep stop taking them and make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you can. Sleep is more important then taking your medication.","dbroxyl",2,1483044477,"2016-12-29 20:47:57"

I can never seem to manage the anxiety, depression, severe sleeping issues, and lack of focus and motivation enough to get one or keep one.

"2671","This is very true for me. I had several different jobs until I found one that I burn for and love. I worked on security for a pub, event companies, building stages, lighting... All of them were fun to a certain extend but after a while I would just lose interest. Start fucking up, miss deadlines, arrive late because something else was more interesting than going to work and basically just burning bridges until I moved on trying to find the next thing.

Until I finally decided I should just make the jump and try to work with what I love. Games and art. I worked as a freelance artist for a couple of years until I got hired by a company where I live. Ive been working as a game artist for 3 years now. I regret not making the jump earlier. I feel as if I had wasted a lot of time in useless jobs that never interested me and it created the feeling that *""worklife just isn't right for me, so why bother going after a job that many say its lots of hard work when I cant even keep these simpler jobs?""* And of course its all **bullshit**. I still have a hard time focusing. I still have my ups and downs. It gets worse when I get stressed with deadlines but I love what I do. I have fun and couldn't be happier. The desire to maintain this job is what motivated me to look for help and start my meds. 

I've been one week now into it. Still experimenting with the doses and I am having a regular checkup next week to see how I am reacting with the meds. I can already feel the difference but I still have to force myself to focus when I have to do some boring tasks or some work mate finds a fun little game that I know I can easily waste the entire morning on. 

This post has excellent advice. Dont let yourself get in the same thought process that I had. Use all the apps, programs and web services you can do help you along the way. I use them and it helps me a lot. Google Calendar, Sms notifications, IFTTT, evernote... Whatever! But go for what you love.

There are also generics available for Bupropion (Wellbutrin) which is an anti-depressant but has a stimulating effect and I’m pretty sure is approved for adult ADHD.  

I’d second the other person who mentioned switching to a generic stimulant that’s cheap. If you have anxiety/a reason you’re on concerta versus an amphetamine (I.e adderall) this may not be a viable choice for you. 

If you’re fucked and just have to be medication free, the withdrawal sucks and can take a few months to recover from. But speaking from experience, routine and other behavioral ADHD strategies can help you stay on top of your responsibilities. Google ADHD interventions, a lot you can apply without needing a psychologist to guide you. I was off mine for over a year and still go straight A’s through routine and learning discipline.

"2692","ADHD is all about the RIGHT LEVEL of stimulation, which is what is happening to you (and happens to me too!). Anxiety is stimulation too, and can be used to your advantage if done right.

No immediate deadlines = low stimulation level =&gt; low focus =&gt; distraction zone

Upcoming deadline = higher anxiety (stimulation) =&gt; anxiety converted to focus =&gt; work gets done

The thing that can be difficult is that for ADHDers there's a HUGE difference between knowing the path, and walking the path. I can see this coming WAY ahead of time, but there's little I find I can do for myself to influence it. All I can do is account and plan for it, which has worked relatively well. Professor gives you a new long-term project with only 1 deadline at the end? That can be dangerous for ADHDers. Ask him for intermediate deadlines, or keep tabs on your classmates' work and use the stress of ""falling behind your classmates"" to get into the zone. Work gives you a vague task with a vague deadline? Ask for VERY SPECIFIC goals, or ask the general purpose of your work and define your own goal/deadline. Essentially the best way to deal with situations like these are to work with others to avoid them completely.

Also, your finding with certain types of music is VERY common among ADHDers (and even some who are not). Again, the music raises your brain's stimulation level in the right way or serves as a ""white noise"" to block out some typical mental noise.

Be wary though not to rely on having only one coping mechanism =&gt; ADHD is also about NOVELTY. Eventually you might get bored with your music or your coping mechanisms. It helps to have a couple ""tools in your toolbox"" to fall back on.

TL;DR:

&gt; Or is it a typical ADHD coping/survival mechanism?

Essentially the answer is yes. =) Try to work with it, not against it, and you should be ok. I managed my way through college doing the same thing.","cvpd1ql",2,1444079949,"2015-10-05 21:19:09"

"2712","Do you have any emotional dysregulation problems?  I ask for there are various forms of bipolar that are co-existing with ADHD in some people.  **One of which is bipolar but there are also other mood dysregulation problems that can create suicidal thoughts when on certain medications**  Now when I say bipolar please understand that there are many forms of bipolar not just bipolar 1 and 2 you may be neutral or depressed most of the time and only elevated mood some of the time to a smaller degree.

I ask for it is common for both ADHD medications but also SSRIs which work completely different to change your mood tremendously if you have bipolar or a different form of mood disorder since the mood disorders work on a spectrum with wide variety.  Succidial thoughts and suicidal actions are both higher in frequency with bipolar.  In addition the percent of people who suddenly have suicidal thoughts activated by medication such as stimulants but also ssris and strattera are more common in the bipolar population vs the non bipolar population.

&amp;nbsp;

I am not a doctor and we can't diagnose co-existing conditions but I hope your doctor and you have at least considered this, especially since you been on 9 different medications, and several of them increase succidal thoughts not just 1 of them.  Of those 9 medications only abilify is used to treat bipolar, and with bipolar there are several different types of medications that work differently and what 1 bipolar person needs is different than another bipolar even if their symptoms look the same, what specifically is going wrong in their body chemistry can be different and thus they need a different medicine since these medicines work differently on a chemical level but also on a genetic level, since genes make things like proteins, enzymes, and other parts of the brain system, and these drugs then modulate those systems.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


If you are with some form of mood disorder such as bipolar but remember it is a family of spectrums and overlaps, being on a mood stabilizer or a medicine called a neuroleptic also sometimes called an antipsychotic can make a tremendously difference.  It can be the difference of medicines you are on currently having major side effects vs them working as they are supposed to with minimal side effects.

And you can actually uses these mood stabalizers and neuroleptics/antipsychotics while at the same time using other meds such as stimulants, strattera, and antidepressants.  I will not go into the chemistry of how these things work for it is complicated but when people calle a stimulant an dopamine enhancer and an antipsychotic a dopamine blocker it gives the wrong impression to the people who do not understand how these medicines work, the real medicine is more complicated and a word like blocker is too simplistic and imprecise.","cu4l2ea",1,1439700826,"2015-08-16 04:53:46"

"2734","I know this is a pretty old post (found it when looking for other info) but I just remembered something my mom used to do! I've always had issues sleeping, partially from ADHD and partially because I was an EXTREMELY anxious kid with really bad separation anxiety. Anyway, when you mentioned the placebo effect, it reminded me that on really bad nights, my mom would give me ""sleeping medicine."" She said it was a secret where she got it, somehow related back to the poppy fields in the Wizard of Oz. It always knocked me out right away. Just recently, at the age of 19, I remembered it and finally asked her what it was. Apparently, it was literally just water with food coloring. But it worked!!

Something else she did was make a CD for me that she would play at night while I was falling asleep. Mostly more peaceful music, but I realize now that things like podcasts actually help me fall asleep much better than music does. Which makes sense, because my mom's main way of helping me through a panic attack used to just be rambling on about nothing or telling me stories until it passed and I would just fall asleep. Looking back, she really handled me so well (as the single mom of an unmedicated kid- I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at 11, ADHD at 16, so all of this was pre-diagnosis, even though she knew I had anxiety issues).

"2757","Well, I'm for sure not trying to abuse my meds. I want whatever is best for me and my body so I can operate at 100%. 

Let me give you some background. Last semester I was working close to full-time while also being a full-time college student and I was able to get most of my work done and get a 4.0. I'm not sure how I accomplished that, I think my driver was higher last semester. This semester I worked full-time at a labor intensive job and continued to be a full-time student - 1 class less though - my grade started slipping in calculus where I have NEVER EVER had a problem in math so I said ""It's time to stop because I can't let this happen"". I used to be a pay attention in class, make a A with a little bit of studying.

Not anymore, I'm not sure why but even when I put a lot of time into studying I just can't remember to save my life. It's starting to really bother me because that's not who I am. So I made the appointment because I need to fix this grade in calculus, my other classes are fine. Low A's so somewhat being effected but not in Calculus where you need to remember how to solve the equations.

I'm not sure what I need or don't need. I have always been a extremely driven individual who has never really been lazy so to speak. After I stopped working fulltime I noticed I can't remember stuff as well as I thought and my concentration slips. I've had a lot of family issues go on recently but I don't really let those things get to me. I'm not fidgety at all - on or off the medicine - which is why I never thought I might have ADD. Sometimes while talking to people my mind will go to a different place briefly and I will not remember what they said. After taking the double dose today I could definitely feel it after 5 hours and I felt like a king honestly. My problem solving was faster then before and I could probably out-think my way out of any problem. I could not really focus on what I needed to do, go get something to eat out, go to the gym, and go home to study. I ended up losing track of time and spent a lot more time out then I would have thought I would. Now it's 12:10 and I'm slightly tired and I have some concentration. I was working on homework trying to knock it out when I saw your reply and my concentration on it was good but my focus on solving the problem was not that great.

Vyvanses really felt like a upper earlier, it was smooth at first but then I started to feel really really good and in control. I ate, met a friend at the restaurant and then hit the gym for a good 1 1/2 hour. This all occurred around 6:00-10:00. I plan on taking it BEFORE I eat tomorrow at 6 in the morning, before class, and seeing what happens.  

I'm not sure about the Dr., that's what she told me so i'm not so sure how to feel about it. Thanks for your help and I really appreciate it. ","d1leitj",1,1459484034,"2016-04-01 04:13:54"

"2798","My parents were the same way. I'm intelligent so they thought I was just lazy. I barely graduated high school and started struggling in college. Once I was eighteen I went out to seek help on my own. They rolled their eyes the entire time, and I was miserable working on my own for a good four months to find help. I finally got diagnosed and they became really accepting once I began medication because they saw the night and day difference, and my mom now tries to help me with diet and exercise to add to the benefits of medication. Medication definitely isn't a fix all solution, but personally it helped me immensely in school and daily life. I finally can do everything I want and get things done. Be strong because only you know yourself best, even if your parents think they do. Once they see how life changes positively for you, hopefully they will get behind you because the support was ultimately what helped me most :)

"2801","Sorry for the delay!

Here we are:

1. I don't want to be too specific and possibly identify myself, but what I will say is that I am near the end of a long residency in a competitive field. 

2. I do have ADHD. I didn't re-start medication until my second year of residency when I wasn't progressing as expected in exams, and was running into interpersonal problems more frequently in the professional realm. I started seeing a psychiatrist who specialises in ADHD and up-titrated my medication with her during my third year, which was immensely helpful. That is when I also started receiving academic accommodations and noticed a huge improvement in my results. My program director and attendings had mentioned often before that my clinical knowledge far outstripped my exam performance, and being medicated and receiving accommodations brought my exam performance nearer what they expected based on my clinical abilities. I take medication every day, and I find it immensely helpful. I also went through some really tough 'life stuff' unrelated to ADHD during my PGY3 year, developed a first episode of depression, and tried vortioxetine, which was very helpful but made me quite nauseated consistently. I trialled off antidepressants unsuccessfully and am now on levomilnacipran, which I have found helpful. I can't speak to the anxiety component of your concerns, as I only experienced anxiety in the context of depression, but I can tell you that there are many, many anxious medical learners out there.

3. I integrate looking after my mental health into my daily life. I work out nearly everyday, and did the same throughout medical school (I was a varsity athlete in two sports) and each year of residency so far. I prep meals and bring my own food instead of eating what is at the hospital. I have a study plan that I adhere to strictly, and I use a paper planner to track myself, and an Apple Watch for reminders and alarms.

4. In theory, I entirely advocate people taking care of their mental health, and that includes medical students. Practically speaking, however, the medical education system isn't built with much flexibility in mind, and you'll be expected to show up regardless of how you're feeling. I avoid disclosing except in situations where I have no other option (for instance, in receiving exam accommodations). People notice that I take medication even when I'm sneaky, but nobody really asks what it's for. It's not that I'm ashamed, but I don't think people need to know, and I don't want to be seen as a problematic resident, much as you don't want to be seen as a problematic medical student! That's part of the reason I suggest you do what you need to to take care of your mental health, even if that includes taking a leave of absence. Better to take time off and perform well than to be nominally on rotation but absent (mentally or physically). 

Okay, also, everyone will look at you like you're incompetent because you *are* incompetent - that's the definition of a medical student! Nobody expects competence until you're a senior resident. For now, just try not to kill anyone. Clerkship is easy - smile, be polite, be punctual, and read around cases. That is really all that is required. A pleasant and enthusiastic attitude will take you far.

Sometimes it's hard for me to function, too. I've had to work really hard on strategies that allow me to succeed. Your needs and strategies will be different, but you will definitely need to work hard, and that's okay. You're allowed to have off days. Honestly, it's kind of embarrassing to look back on when I wasn't managing my symptoms as well as I am now. Everyone tells me now that I've matured so much, or comments on how far I have come. But nobody every remarked that I was a bad resident before - because I wasn't! You're probably judging yourself more harshly than anyone else is.

Finally, because I know this is a novel, if a teacher (an attending, a resident, a fellow, whoever) makes you feel stupid or inadequate, that is not a you problem. It's a them problem. You don't teach people by making them feel dumb or bad about themselves. So...when you encounter this - and you will, if you haven't already - just remember that, and brush it off.

I also felt really calm, in fact I was initially struck by the thought that I'd never really felt calm before in my life, except in a tranquilized way from alcohol.

The initial feeling I had (described by my psychiatrist when I was trying to explain it as ""having a light switched on when you've always been in the dark"") did fade a bit, and you might feel some disappointment about that, but even if you don't notice the effect of the Ritalin as much after a while, because your memory of the contrast with the old you fades, the effect does continue.

If you feel your episodes of these mood swings of happiness and sadness are unusual/extreme (that it feels like mania vs depression), it might be worth ruling out other things.

Exercising as your medication starts to wear off usually helps, or splitting up your doses more (like taking less more frequently instead of higher doses twice a day). I take adderall IR and i usually will take a very small amount, like 2-3.5 mg, as mine is wearing off since it keeps me from crashing and getting insanely tired and gloomy if I don’t have time to exercise. 

Make sure you’re taking care of your habits and play around with your dosage to see if that helps. Taking b-12/b-9 supplements also is a big help for mood regulation for those with ADHD.

The generics may all have the same active ingredient, but they're all bound into a pill with different fillers, and some people have bad reactions to certain fillers.

There were a lot of times, in between getting the generic that didn't work and seeing my psychiatrist again a few days ago, where I thought about how it would be so much easier to do these projects when I get my meds fixed.  It would be so much easier to settle down and get to work with a different generic that isn't crap for me.  Really, you couldn't *really* expect me to get my work done without my meds, could you?

Except that I got work done for years before I got diagnosed and started meds this year.  It may have been slow and inefficient, and I may not have always accomplished everything I wanted, but I was capable of doing at least some things.

I've heard ADHD likened to a screaming toddler always taking over and throwing tantrums in your head, and sometimes that feels like a very apt description.  But you just gotta sit that toddler in time out and do your best to keep muddling on.  

I'm glad you're already aware meds won't solve everything, and the first one you try might not even work at all.  Even after I got a new prescription with a generic that didn't make me feel like crap, I still sometimes have to fight that brain toddler in order to get started on things.  It's easier, with the meds, and easier to stay on task once I've started, but you've still gotta have your own willpower too.  It's probably alright to put off that home-office organization binge, but hopefully you can figure out how to get necessary stuff done!

And I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you find a good medication quickly!  It is a pretty wonderful feeling when you do find the right one.","e9pxwhx",2,1542246860,"2018-11-15 01:54:20"

I also started taking vitamin d supplements, already eat a lot of cheese, and switched to sorbitol free toothpaste (and less fructose in general), and the latter had a very noticeable effect on my teeth and gums (I don’t bleed anymore even when I forget to brush my teeth for days). So much of our dental health is actually about our diet and general health, not about how often we brush - I brush once a day at most, can’t even floss (my teeth are too close together), and I still had actual small holes remineralise in the last year so I don’t even need as many fillings as I did a year and a half ago.

I visited the dentist the other day so I’m still a bit gleeful about this, my teeth have been a source of anguish and annoyance for years.

Edit: mouthwash has no scientific basis and actually dries your moth out over time, it’s generally best avoided.

"2879","Bah I forgot to finish my thought on elementary kids and why the meds get a bad reputation (I was tired at the time and not thinking completely.) I am going to go into more detail I hope I do not bore you :)

The downside of giving elementary kids medicine is that the parents do not always notice side effects for them being in school all day and the meds wear off, and that the elementary kid is not good at explaining at explaining I do not like this med for it makes me feel ""empty"" for I am having emotional side effects.  This side effect occurs in 1 in 5 kids and a slightly lower number in adults, it has to do with genetics and drug interaction.  It does not occur with the non stimulants strattera and intuniv, and there are advantages of those drugs compared to the stimulants, but the stimulants also have advantages and which drug you respond best to has a lot to do with genetics.

Very young kids sometimes do not notice this change and can't communicate it well with their parents, or if they do communicate it is not very helpful besides I hate it, and the parents not knowing what to do respond to instinct and discontinue all meds instead of doing more research or talking to their doctor.  

And when the kids get home the meds were no longer active for until recently the duration of meds were measured in 3 to 8 hours.  Only since 2000 did we have a stimulant that lasted longer than 8 hours with Concerta, and now we have several.

[Timeline of when ADHD meds were released](http://pediatrics.about.com/od/adhd/a/history_adhd_2.htm) notice most of those meds are the stimulants methyphendiate and the stimulant amphetamine

[Webmd on the duration of meds in how many hours](http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/adhd-medication-chart)

Furthermore some parents saw their kids exhausted when they got home, but never saw the positives of the kid at school.  If you are on too high of a dose of a med and it has a very quick activation and release such as the instant release medications then you can feel very tired when it wears off.  In other people they get irritabile and easily frustrated.  The answer to this is to use one of the newer meds with the same active ingredients but a slower onset, a peak, and a gradual offset or to take a very small instant stimulant release when the kid gets home from school as a booster to make the changes more gradual.  Now the kid who was already tired from school can have energy to have fun, play, be a kid, and at the late elementary years can do homework if they have homework.

-----

Thus if you start a young kid on medication my advice and I have heard it repeated by many doctors is to start the dose real small, and go up slowly while observing the kid to see if there is any side effects.  Furthermore get your teacher involved for she or he should be monitoring your kid for the side effects and communicating any info with you.  Give her a list of possible side effects and she can e-mail you if she is concerned.  (Anyways one of the most effective way to help ADHD kids in school is to have a daily report card that the kids know about, the parent gives them 1 to 5s for like 4 categories like play well with others/kept hands to himself, paid attention in class, completed class work, turned in homework, raised hand and take turns, and a place for comments), the kid's job is to hand it to the parent or the parent gets it via email.  The parent then does daily rewards or consequences depending on if there was 1s or 5s.  This takes only 20 or so seconds for the teacher to do yet it stops so many problems in class for many ADHD students that it often improves the entire classroom and the more time the teacher has to teach.

Also starting the medication on the weekends and spending 2 days watching your kid and seeing what is happening helps for you have hands on experiences and you can notice side effects.

-----

Now the nonstimulant meds have many advantages for they have different benefits and different side effects.  Some people do better with the non stimulants, some with the stimulants and some a combination of the two at low or medium doses (I am the latter).

---

I am going to stop for I think you get the point, medicine is not all or nothing, there are many types and if you find the right type it is all upside or close to it.  We spend all this energy picking out our favorite foods, but very rarely do people have the right type of relationship with their doctor to cover all this, they communicate with him, and write notes down to make sure they do not forget things.

They also rarely do research on the meds and if they do, they often look for personal stories instead of going to medical experts or see a study saying X kids had this side effect, Y kids had this one.  Emotions are good, but they need to be channeled into better decisions.  And some people about 10% just do not do well on meds and that is okay, meds are not for everyone but they do help 90% of ADHD people.

You get the point :)

when you have enough salt (or other electrolytes) in your body, its just a lot easier to be comfortable, stay relaxed, and keep your energy up. 
It really changed things for me when i started paging attention to them, and again, i dont know you! but if you experience anxiety like i do, you might be low on these things! 🤠

caffeine and sugar are diuretics, which make you pee, and drain your electrolytes.

Log effectiveness along with any othef side effects you're experiencing. 

Adderall has done wonders for me. Currently on a 25mg extended release with a 5mg instant release. The extended doesn't have much of a 'high' for me but I do notice that I feel more awake and aware.

"2900","From what I remember, Stratterra is affecting only noradrenaline reuptake. Amphetamine affects dopamine as well.

Where I live we don't have Adderall, Dexedrine nor Vyvanse as well. However, there are:

1. bupropion (Wellbutrin XR) - it is available in many european countries, for treating depression or ADHD. It's actually a substituted amphetamine, so might get you similar results.
2. methylphenidate (Concerta, in US mostly Ritalin IIRC) - it's reserved for ADHD, I think it's affecting dopamine more - but I haven't used it, so can't tell you much

Both of these drugs affects both noradrenaline and dopamine, like amphetamine. There's more probably. I have no idea how similar they are though, I've no experience with amphetamine.

Be aware that the euphoria effect you get when you start taking a dopamine affecting med/drug wears off after a while - my first month with Wellbutrin was amazing, later... well, much better than before starting, but not as cool.

Maybe if you go to your doc stating you're still having anhedonia etc he will try getting you those other meds?","cqsu8dc",1,1430328324,"2015-04-29 17:25:24"

"2918","Alright, first of all : **I have no qualification on ADHD so take what I say with a grain of salt.**

Now with that out of the way, let's continue..

You might want to watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnS0PfNyj4U).. This explains how ADHD meds works.. which also discusses things such as ""emotional bluntness"" that you described..

Also, I just want to say that the intention of ADHD meds is not to suppress the emotion, or ""superpower"".. The purpose of the stimulant is to help cope with the disability that is ADHD.. Some meds activates the frontal lobe, while other meds blocks the neurotransmitter reuptake in the brain to make up for what people who have ADHD seems to lack..

anyways, I agree that people should not take this condition as a very negative thing (which what most of these comments are trying to say), but one thing that it's certainly not is it's not a superpower..","cnce5r8",4,1420227214,"2015-01-02 19:33:34"

Ask trusted others if they notice a difference in you post medication.  My type A wife absolutely can tell and often informs me without prompting if I missed a day of medication.  
  
You are feeling the impact of opinions and influences from a world where many think ADHD isn't even a real thing.  How many of these have you heard?  Slow down.  If you just work harder and focus more, everything would be fine.  Can you sit still please?  Buckle down and stop being lazy.  If you just applied yourself more...  Get your head out of the clouds and get this done.  Just be patient.
  
To some extent it is true, if we focus more and work harder things will turn out better.  What many don't comprehend is that what many would consider ""normal"" focus is often very difficult for us to achieve, double for things that don't interest us or requires more mental effort.  
  
Think about it this way: If you answered the questions honestly, and probably conservatively like I did for fear of sounding like an addict, and you were still given an ADHD diagnosis...you have ADHD.  If you take the prescribed meds and you don't turn into a spastic/hyper mess?  Also a strong sign.
  
The next whammie you deal with?  Comprehending how much easier life is on medication and the realization of lost past potential.  I was in your exact shoes until I tried Vyvanse for the first time at 38 and it revealed how much coping I had been doing all my life.

1. Auditory Processing Disorder means it takes you more time and effort to understand what you're hearing. It's like the sound is being poured through a funnel - too much at once and you start missing things, unless you really put in some effort.

2. ADHD means you have trouble controlling where your attention goes. Boring things are even more boring, and you're very easily distracted. Unless you're paying attention to something interesting, in which case you hyperfocus and it's hard for anything else to get your attention.

I've done that all my life, it's actually a memorization technique. I'm fortunate enough to not have inattentive type, so ymmv. 

Personally, I put all the pills on the counter while I'm making tea, turn every one upside down that I haven't taken yet that day, and get water out. So, it's all sitting on the counter and I'm definitely going to return there even if I get distracted (because the kettle will go off, and then my timer goes off once tea is brewed... plus... you know, it's the kitchen, I might eat something, etc.) I take a lot of vitamins and some other stuff for GAD... plus birth control... so...

"3031","Nope! There's lots of research into alternative treatments to supplement or replace medication in treating ADHD. 

Exercise is definitely helpful, as well as other basic steps like proper nutrition and getting enough sleep. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to be useful for ADHD and pretty much everything else it's been studied on. It's like exercise for your brain. Biofeedback (can only be done at a therapist's) and dual n-back training (like a not fun version of the Simon Game) are promising areas of research as well. They actually work to improve executive functioning deficits (especially working memory) that medication doesn't target at all. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can be very useful if you have insurance or can find a low cost counselor. 

Some people believe that oils (like fish oil and flaxseed oil) help, but last I checked the research was far from conclusive. Personally, I find that  eating a diet with a good amount of healthy fats helps me feel better mentally all around.

"3039","I'm a psychologist who has ADHD. Your post is completely representative of the difficulty of diagnosing ADHD - especially in adults and teenagers.  It can be super frustrating. A lot of the symptoms of ADHD can be caused by many things. ADHD like symptoms can redoubt from ADHD, anxiety, depression, or even things like language disabilities and sleeplessness. In order to diagnose ADHD you frequently need to rule out all of the other things first. It sounds like you have some symptoms that are more likely to be related to anxiety/depression than ADHD (e.g. Easily agitated/bad temper). That's not to say that you definitely have those or that don't have ADHD too. I don't know you. I'm just saying that those symptoms are more likely to relate to something other than ADHD.  Your other symptoms are common with one or more of those three.  For me when working with this kind of situation, historical background and context are very important.  When I have the chance, I'll even scour 10 year old report card comments for clues.  It takes experience and judgement - which is why psychologists go to school forever. Either way - if you're not comfortable with the psychologist, I would discuss it with them, or find a different psychologist. You can also look into a psycho-educational or neuropsychological evaluation that might better help you understand what's going on (and give more objective criteria for diagnosis). However - those kinds of tests can also be affected by anxiety/depression so fair warning. 

Sorry I can't be more help. The bottom line is that there's no clear indicator. If you're not comfortable, seek a second opinion.  That's very common in the mental health world. ","d19nlny",1,1458681642,"2016-03-22 21:20:42"

Get a 2L water bottle and keep it filled and by your desk. I find it even more helpful if it has a straw for some reason. 

Do you find cooking overwhelming? Do you order in a lot?

It's okay if you can't get to bed (but I think it would make you feel really good). If that's the case, bring everything you need (pillow, blanket, any meds you'll need, etc.) out to where you usually fall asleep. Brush your teeth and wash your face when you go to the washroom. If that's too much, mouth wash and a baby wipe to the important places is an easy trick too. 

Go outside once a day! Even if you stand on the front step for a moment, the sun and the air will feel good. If you have neighbours it will help remind you that you're not really alone.

The book says the tongue places 1 pound of pressure on the upper palate each time we swallow. Given we swallow hundreds of time a day, that hundreds of pounds of work that is being done. That goes a long way to strengthening the airway.

When he gets new residents soon I'll likely get assigned to one of them and not him, I hope they get it because frankly I don't know how I'll hand it if they don't.

"3097","Oh yikes, definitely don't want anything going out that way except pee! 0.o

The spironolactone preceeded the Vyvanse by quite a bit, but my doctor never mentioned there might be any interactions between the two. Then again, Vyvanse is such a (comparatively) new form of dex, and there are so many different meds out there, I'm sure it's still a bit of a science experiment. I'm luckily in that I haven't really had any side effects from Vyvanse except that it doesn't last as long as it says it should. 

So, do you think peeing more often might make the Vyvanse not last as long? Or is urination less important than the chemical processes/interactions that may be happening further up in the processing of the drug? Do you know anything that might help the duration of it? It seems like for everyone who says ""taking Mg helps"" or ""don't drink orange juice"" there's someone else who says ""Mg will do nothing"" and ""orange juice won't affect Vyvanse"". The only thing that seemed pretty well uncontested was the sodium bicarbonate thing, but I now see that has its risks. 

My problem is that I have to take it first thing in the morning or I can't really get my morning routine done, but if I do take it first thing in the morning then by the time I'm ready to relax with my SO in the late afternoon/evening I'm pretty much off the Vyvanse and crashed. As I mentioned I don't see my psych for almost 4 months (he works at the clinic I go to only one day a week so rescheduling is pretty difficult, and even when the quarterly visits role around I get to see him for 15 minutes) and I can't really change doctors for insurance reasons (basically that I don't have any).

"3103","This is not an accurate read on the article.  Specifically, what it says regarding these two models is the following:

&gt; However, neurodiversity advocates reject the medical model of autism, in favour of an as-yet undetermined social model that blames the problems faced by autistic people on systematic ‘ableist’ discrimination. Some of their reasons for doing so are valid. Historically, autistic people have existed on the margins of society, and have been victimised by the medical-industrial complex that aimed to coercively eliminate them and others considered to be disabled. For example, Asperger was complicit in the Nazi regime’s euthanasia programme for disabled children.

&gt; Since then, the medical view of autism has changed dramatically. Researchers and clinicians do not want to eradicate autism – they aim to understand it in order to develop treatments for those who want them.

What this means is that while an entirely medical model cannot account for certain presentations of symptoms being discriminated against, so too an entirely social model cannot account for clear differences in brain chemistry that can cause impairments which affect individuals even outside of the context of their place in society.

What the article thus posits is that both models present only partial pictures, and that the harm in the neurodiversity movement stems from proponents who do not acknowledge this and simply decry the medical model in its entirety as the domain of Nazis and eugenicists.","g2s6bxs",1,1598345202,"2020-08-25 08:46:42"

"3122","What I've found works best for me is paying attention in school as much as possible. Even if you're doing something else: drawing or writing, or counting the tiles on the ceiling (is that weird?), just pay attention to what's going on and take notes.

Doing homework is another story. Find something that calms you, keeps you focused. For me, it's ambient music. The background noise lets me enjoy something 'stimulating' i guess while doing boring homework. You just have to practice discipline in working.

On a more scientific note, studies show that the normal attention span for someone is about 10-15 minutes. After that, they get distracted. Based off of that, try doing about 12 minutes of work or something, then enjoy yourself for 10 minutes, alternating work and relaxation. This can keep you focused and generally makes people more productive. Maybe the short time frames can help people with ADHD focus on their work easier.

Brand-name medications tend to be more expensive, in general, falling mostly in Tier 3 of multi-tier prescription plans.  Vyvanse copays typically run several hundred dollars unless you have very good insurance or you qualify for something like the Shire discount program.  Same thing goes for mecications like Focalin or Daytrana.  Strattera is usually quite expensive as well.

Concerta: Methylphenidate. Constantly hungry, euphoria, weird sudden bursts of calmness. Did not like Concerta at all. One pill lasted 4 hours, two lasted too long and made it hard to sleep.

The come down made me very tired, can be a bonus when you need to sleep. Not fun if I need to do things off meds in the evenings.

Elvanse: (Vyvanse) Lisdexamphetamine. Almost no side effects, aside from some euphoria during the first couple of days. Slightly higher heart rate (80 instead of 70), feel somewhat warmer.

"3161","So my testing took about 6 hours in total, including some take home tests to fill out myself. This was probably because I was also being tested for autism, so let's say for ADHD it took 4 hours. 

I did the joining numbers ones, and the repeating numbers ones that you did. Except the repeating was repeat this number in order. Repeat this number backwards. Repeat this mixture of letters and numbers in order. Repeat this mixture in numerical and alphabetical order etc. I can't even remember the number of different combinations. 

I also did a full IQ test. The results of this were consistent with ADHD. My overall IQ is above average, but when divided into processing, perception, memory, and the other one I can't remember, there was a clear divide. My perception was in the 99th percentile (REALLY high) but my processing was in the low average range. Which basically translates to ""you're really smart, but good luck getting anyone to realise that"". 

My point being, I'm surprised that he didn't get you to do an IQ test. A lot of ADHD people who have minimal issue with early schooling turn out to just be smart enough to compensate. A lot of ADHD people have IQ results that are significantly lower in working memory and processing compared to the other two, and it explains so much!

If you can get referred to a new psychologist, I would strongly recommend requesting more in depth testing, including an IQ test. At the least it might be able to explain to the psychologist why someone with ADHD had good grades!

Sorry! This is longer than I expected!

TL:DR - go to another psychologist and get an IQ test (in relation to ADHD testing). It is entirely possible to be smart enough to compensate for ADHD, until you reach a level where you actually need to work for it and can't.","emx8bjd",1,1557412006,"2019-05-09 14:26:46"

Side effects vary from person to person but I can tell you, using the lowest dosage, reducing overall stressful environments including people, getting enough sleep, eating less sugar or any foods that trigger inflammation, exercise and medication should reduce or remove most side effects but there are too many variables to individuals. Some people have side effects on Ritalin but not Concerta and it's the same drug dosed differently, kind of have to experiment while taking care of general health. Medication assists but you still need to do all the other things.

"3203","I didn't read the whole thing but skimmed it. 

I was diagnosed late in life. People called me smart and I applied myself. But at some point, I noticed nothing happens when I arrive late or not work hard. Life goes on and nobody really cares. Yeah, you get fired, but that's about it. 

When I figured that out it was hard to apply myself and do anything right or on time. Downside was: I felt like a big failure. That's when I got my diagnosis for adhd. This helped me because I don't have to feel bad for being a failure. I can't help it that I have a disease, that's how I see it. So I am kinder to myself. 

But still I am upset that I cannot perform like I did before I got medication. It helps because I get things done but is it a long term solution? Not really. I don't have the same internal motivation.

But I am reading a book on female leadership skills and basically it says that women (and I think it applies to anyone with Adhd) often have a negative voice in their head telling them they're not good enough. And the fear of being not good enough pushes them to do better. But you never feel at ease (causing diseases because of stress) and you never step outside of the safe zone to really do what you are meant to do. You are meticulous to do your small task really well, but is that really what you should be doing? Maybe you need to be taking risks, doing what you need to do with your life, not trying to do that one task perfectly, to please others. 

So now I am no longer seeing my failure to work hard as a loss, I am seeing it as letting go and no longer wanting to perform to please others and no longer avoiding fear of failure. Maybe it's the first step in pushing us to find what we need to really be doing in this life?","delxk9p",2,1488868163,"2017-03-07 06:29:23"

Everything just improved from then on. I found that it helped me to focus as well. I felt better, focused somewhat better, and I got more done. It did take a while to find the right dosage, though. 

You should definitely talk to your doctor about these things. I'm glad I did, and maybe the ""fix"" will be just as easy as switching medication.

"3209","&gt;For the always looking for the best issue, what worked for me was once I can determine a decision is arbitrary it should be treated as one. Before you did any research there were millions of choices for bags. But i'm sure you have narrowed it down to only a few. At this point, if you rolled a dice to determine which one you get, it's going to be a really good bag. It doesn't matter anymore, you've already eliminated all the bad choices. So at the point I just go with my gut. 

This is what I'm coming to realize. I am working on forcing myself to stop what I'm doing at the time (looking for *the* perfect backpack for example) and doing at least one thing that needs done (doing some housework or whatever). Whatever I was doing will be there when I get done. I have a problem doing that right now because I have the mentality that if I stop in the middle of something and don't finish what I am doing there is a 90% chance I will forget about it before I have a chance to come back to it. Because of this I've learned to hyperfocus even more than I usually would, just so I can get that thing done before I forget about it. 

Just this afternoon I pumped gas and went inside to grab some food, and bumped into my neighbor while I was there. We started talking and I left without paying for my gas because if it is out of my sight, it is out of my mind. Luckily the gas station was very cool about and just let my neighbor know when he went in later (he's a regular and mentioned we were neighbors). Stuff like that is why I have to be an asshole and tell someone I can't talk/do whatever/etc... at that time, or why I don't get my other to-do's done. I always have a lot of half-assed tasks on my to-do list done, but rarely do I get more than one actually done.

Right now I have stuff to do (I am in the middle of trying to clean my office area) but noticed I had some replies and didn't want to seem like an asshole when I inevitably forgot about this post later so I started typing a reply instead of finishing my cleaning.

Anyway, thanks for replying. I'm going to try to be more decisive and stick with what I know works. Now I'm going to force myself to get back to work.

Thanks again!

After taking 10mg each day for three days I notice I’m more social and am not as anxious as I usually am. I also have more energy and willingness to complete tasks although procrastination is still an issue. However, the effects wear off in only 2 hours which I did not expect.

"3213","Respectfully - I think you're only addressing splitting here, which is one way these folks rationalize their behavior in the moment and after.

I think understanding right and wrong - and even feeling sorrow - is separate from but also able to be related to the self-image/enmeshment dynamics (ie. extension of self that I referred to) and deep fear of abandonment that is so characteristic of the disorder. See: parentification, emotional incest, and so on. I also think that core fear is likely what leads to the erratic painting of others as all good/all bad and abrupt changes in affect, and why it's a Cluster B. 

Splitting shows up lots of places, but in this case I think it's one resultant behaviour of rather than the defining hallmark feature of BPD.

"3216","I’ve had a similar experience as you. With vastly different experiences with brands of medication. I’ve found that name brand meds are different from their generics and the various manufacturers of the generics also differ. 

Having worked in a pharmacy I know that medications frequently go on back order and they can’t order your preferred brand. They just have what they have. With that said I recommend calling around to the local pharmacies and find one that has the one you want. Then have the doc send the script there with specific instructions as to which brand. 
It’s annoying to have to do every month, but when your functionality is so dependent on it, it doesn’t seem like a big deal. 

Also if you are starting a new medication then searching the internet to see what manufacturer the majority of adhd people prefer is a good idea. Usually there’s a consensus as to which generic is most consistent.","gosglts",2,1614310202,"2021-02-26 03:30:02"

"3218","1 of the best advises I can give you is to study with someone close to you like your friends, siblings, and the most effective your parents. Yes it may seem annoying to study with your parents but if you study with your parents they will A.) Help you build confidence by encouraging you to study and giving you positive feedback when you do something correct ( which will help you be confident with your skills). B.) They will make sure that you dont get distracted, cause when you study infront of someone (especially your parents) you will try your best not to get distracted. Which,with time, will become a habit which will make you later on become less distracted when you study alone. Plus your parents will make you concentrate again if you get distracted or you start day dreaming. Studying with your parents can also act a way to spend time with them and bound with them, which will make you be excited when its time to study.

Now if your now living alone or you cant find anyone to study with I suggest preparing the next lessons that you have in school/Uni in advance.  Yes its a pian in the ass, but this will help be more active in class and help you be more engaged and understand the lesson better in class, and even if you get distracted will still have an idea what the lesson is about. And when you be more active and understand the lesson better (and look cool infront of your colleagues and teachers that you actually know the lesson and know how to answer all the questions in class) it help be more confident with your abilities in the future.

"3221","I've been looking into the mechanisms of tolerance for amphetamine and it is most certainly a complicated story.  

Without going into too much detail, I highly suspect that the mechanism that allows for super-efficient learning is the same mechanism that builds tolerance to some of the effects of amphetamine. Chiefly, memory related (and by a complicated route, feelings of euphoria (buzz), etc).  

In other words, each time you dose up to the point where you feel that solid buzz and have super-efficient learning, you are also significantly strengthening the tolerance to that effect. There doesn't seem to be any way around it, you can't have the super learning, without the tolerance.  
Bad things can happen if your memory is too good all of the time (think along the lines of post traumatic stress disorder), so it makes sense that your body would try to protect against that.  

Sorry again buddy. There just isn't a way, without taking higher and higher doses. This opens you to significant danger of getting a physical and psychological addiction to amphetamine which will destroy your education faster and more irrevocably than failing an exam.

"3223","TL;DR    
Everyone seeking a diagnosis as an adult needs to interview their psychiatrist (a GP doesn't cut it).  Ask what their experience with ADHD is.  
If it is not a focus of their practice, find another doctor or ask for them to send you to a consult with one who does.


-------

My first psychiatrist tried the same type of diagnosis on me, without the anxiety.  
**Atypical depression.**  For when you can't actually meet the proper criteria for depression.  

I spent over a year sampling different antidepressants and it wasn't until I responded well to high-dose Wellbutrin that she finally decided to try me on Ritalin.  When I told her it made me sleepy (like a fatigue high),she looked like she wanted to throw me out.  

Fortunately, another doctor had come to town to work out of the hospital clinic and he was a child psychiatrist who's primary focuses were ADHD and Aspergers.  She sent me for a consult and he took my case over immediately.   My quality of life took a huge change for the better.  

In retrospect, I learned her bread and butter was in eating disorders.  Combine a lack or personal/professional experience with ADHD and meeting a previously undiagnosed 30 year old (who was an avid reader and was intelligent enough to coast through most school until college), she was likely extremely hesitant to diagnose adult ADHD (this was before DSM-V).  

Ten years on and I'm still bitter over this.   
Prozac was a beast.  In general, many of these drugs can screw with your mind.   I lost more than a year of my life to unpleasant medications.  
And don't get me started on the way psychiatrists will attempt to prescribe pharmaceuticals and treat you for things without actually disclosing your diagnosis.  *That is not consent.*

I also was able to start getting into purging clutter. (So on and so forth.)

Studies that show brain damage from stimulant use are typically based on animals or on those who are abusing stimulants. There has been less research on long-term therapeutic doses. I've heard some findings that suggest it helps the brain function in a more normal fashion. Of course, I am not a doctor, so discuss it with someone who has medical training or who can cite more of the data. (I don't have the free time right now to hunt for it, nor the training to interpret it well.) But I have not yet heard anything to suggest therapeutic, human, ADHD-individual stimulant use leads to brain damage. It has had a consistently positive influence on my functioning, and I take it daily (aside from missed doses).

Hope this helps somewhat -- but do contact a professional for more reliable information. Of course, they may not all agree with each other -- so have them tell you about the findings they are basing their opinion on, and use your judgment.

The nt kids looked at the eyes more than both other groups and the kids with adhd looked at the mouth more than both the asd and nt groups did. 

So this study suggests there is possibly some measurable difference regarding eye contact between neurotypical and adhd people.","eowlrgd",1,1558911567,"2019-05-26 22:59:27"

"3255","I've been on short acting Dex for about a month and a bit. 

So far:
- The first week was bad. Exec dysfunction was worse and I was having bad anxiety and depression as it wore off as well as fleeting suicidal thoughts. 

- I need to take 4mg melatonin every night or I can't sleep. I won't take a dose of Dex after 12 noon for this reason.

- Lack of sleep causes me to oversleep on weekends. 

- I struggle to eat. Not only am I not hungry but I need to sip water between bites because my mouth gets so dry I can literally choke. (soup and protein shakes save me). 

- When the meds wear off my brain is more cloudy than it used to be. Sometimes I feel mildly depressed and anxious as it wears off. 

- recently I've been getting the sensation of something stuck in my throat (like a pill) apparently this is a physical anxiety symptom. It doesn't stop me eating or drinking but it's annoying. 

- I work and study, when I get home from work you think I can study? Fat chance. 

- Focus is improved but sometimes I focus on things I shouldn't (scrolling) 

- excoriation can be worse. I pick at my lips a LOT more some days (some days are better than others) 

It's certainly not the silver bullet I was hoping for but at least I know that I CAN have periods of productivity when I need them and that I'm not actually dumb... I just have an impairment. 

I have been told it can take some time for the side effects to even out so I'm just holding out for as long as I can.

"3259","We are not “fixed,” as there is no way for the medication to adjust for the structural differences and the parts of our brains that just don’t work. It’s a tool that gets us closer to “normal” function and gets after the neurochemical reasons we struggle to do things and gets us to the stimulation levels our brains need for basic functioning. All of the other differences in thought, needs for external structure and motivation, time blindness, etc. ARE STILL THERE. The meds just give us the boost that would make implementing skills, routines, and other compensatory measures possible. 

Your coach was right. Pills don’t teach skills. Pills are like a wheelchair - they get you moving when you’d otherwise be stuck. Some people think medications or disability aids are “crutches,” but that’s hardly a bad thing! Crutches *enable* you when you’d otherwise be unable to move on your own. Medication is the same way.

"3293","Let me ramble a bit to help further the point.

I was extremely gifted in school. Never had to pay attention or apply myself to anything. As a result I had no idea how to focus (we can do it with serious conscious effort and a lot of hard work. Like flipping a switch but you have to hold it on where most people can turn it on and walk away) or apply myself to a challenge. I would be top of everything with no effort but when I faced a situation I couldn't just coast through I would either be forced to fully apply myself and accomplish amazing things or give up and not even try. The latter 85% of the time because the focus was involuntary back then.

I was an utter failure in the real world. It's been near a decade since I was in any academic setting and I find my grammar and writing is far from flawless but I can still write just as well as I always could, grammatical and formatting errors aside. 

For the first time I'm confident instead of cocky. I used to get arrogant but be terrified of failure because I had no capacity for self improvement. Now though I accept failure as a learning experience. That's why I invite people to critique my writing as long as they are willing to back up their criticisms.

You can't know you are wrong if no one ever tells you so. But you also never know what you can do until you try. My old mentality used to be ""Can I pull this off?"" even at the best of times. Now it's more ""I can do anything until proven otherwise"" and it's amazing what a difference in worldview it gives","e19nmwp",2,1529943018,"2018-06-25 16:10:18"

Person A will love it. Person B will not get any effect. And Person C will have horrible side effects.

* ADHD predominantly hyperactive-impulsive (**ADHD-PH**), presents with excessive fidgetiness and restlessness, hyperactivity, difficulty waiting and remaining seated, immature behavior; destructive behaviors may also be present. 

* ADHD combined type (**ADHD-C**) is a combination of the first two subtypes.

"3308","I'm most productive when nobody else is awake. A decade ago that was staying up all night. These days it's getting up at 5am.


If I can't focus, get up and walk around the block. If I come back and still can't focus, stop working. I know most people aren't in a position to do that, but it works for me. I'm not going to get anything done anyway, so might as well not be miserable about it. I can always start working again if I feel like it or if there is an emergency at work.


I always bring a stress ball to long, boring meetings. Also, standing and pacing while talking through things helps a ton. It's perfectly ok to stand during a zoom call.


If I need to plan out a big project, I'll grab a notepad and go to the park. I'll sit on a bench and work on the plan for a bit, until I start feeling overwhelmed, and then I'll immediately get up and start walking while still thinking through the plan. Walking gives me no commitment to put things on paper. I'm free to just ponder about it. After 5 or 10 minutes I'm frantically trying to find another place to sit (often just end up on the ground) so I can write down all the things I just thought of. Rinse and repeat until it's done. 


If I end the day productive and excited about what I'm working on, write down a to-do list for tomorrow so I can jump right into where I left off.


Always, always, always calendar everything. Check your calendar every single morning. Have your phone send you a reminder 10 minutes before an event starts.


For important events, set two alarms. One to give you enough time to prepare, one to remind you again when you forget after the first one. My first alarm is early enough that I can wrap up work, get ready, and be there 5 minutes early. My second alarm is my ""oh shit I'm late"" alarm. If you have to be somewhere 10 minutes away, set your second alarm for 9 minutes before you need to be there. Then you HAVE to act on it immediately, and you'll only be a couple of minutes late.


Put a tracker on your keys and wallet. I have a tile. I have probably saved 100 hours of my time, easily, over the years from just being able to find my wallet and keys easily. Also, there is a button on my tile that rings my phone.


Pick your battles. It's a pretty common saying, but most people don't understand what it means. Or at least, what it means if you are ADHD. It DOES NOT mean pick your battles in the moment. That doesn't work. Then it's just doing whatever you feel like doing. You have to pick your battles in advance. You have to consciously think through ""this is where I put my foot down"" BEFORE you are in that situation. The key here though is to be super picky about what battles you are willing to fight yourself for. Start with ONE. Literally one single thing you will make yourself do every single time. That one thing will eventually be a habit you don't have to think about. When you get there (it's going to take months), add another.
Examples:
 - I HATE dirty floors. They make me feel gross. So, if the floor is dirty, I'm going to fucking clean it, even if I really really really don't feel like it right now. Future self will thank me.

 - If I'm not being productive at work, then stop working. I'm going to lose that battle anyway, so might as well not try. I'll be back after lunch or tomorrow morning.



I write notes on a physical notepad. Helps me concentrate to have something physical.


I always keep a full water bottle at my desk. If I get hyperfocused I'll forget to eat, but at least I'll have a little water in me, because I'm absentmindedly sip at it throughout the day.


Whenever I'm doing something mindless (cleaning, dishes, mowing, driving, laundry) I'm listening to an audiobook. If it's a good book, I'll keep being productive so I have an excuse to keep listening.","gcdpct6",2,1605441068,"2020-11-15 11:51:08"
"3309","Holy shit, this is exactly what happened with my ex... I've only recently found out about my ADHD, got actually diagnosed and started taking medication and doing psychotherapy, I've been lurking this Reddit since and it's been overwhelming to read about people having such similar experiences ... but this one fucked me up so bad. How did you manage to get past it? It's still so hard for me at times , is it something I should discuss with my therapist? During and after my relationship with her I kinda stopped recognizing myself in the mirror for a while, I would cry if I saw myself because I didn't know how I got there I didn't know who I was, I felt like an outsider looking at myself, it still happens that I have some confusion while looking in the mirror but it's rare. I was almost 3 years with her and it feels like a blank. I can remember some things with some detail here and there and I'm certain I was in an emotional abusive relationship, it wasnt all bad for sure I had some good moments, but she said she would kill herself if I left a couple of months in, she would get upset if I went out with friends, wouldn't let me talk with other girls , she  would constantly tell me I was wrong and didn't remember things right and make me feel constantly unsure of everything I did or said, constantly critize every mistake , every lapse in judgement, everything I forgot, it was so fucking harmful.

* Like **awjustaguy** said, just commit to **one section, one problem, or 'just' 30 minutes** (or even just 5 minutes) of studying.  

* Try the pomodoro technique -- tell yourself ""I'll study for X minutes"" (or even just ""sit there *trying* to study and trying to *focus* on studying for X minutes).  ""Then I can clean/relax/do something else for X minutes,"" where X = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 minutes.

* Alternately you could try ""focus for 30 (or 45) minutes and take a break for 15 (or 30) minutes."" -- The focus time should be equal or greater than the break time.

Well, that's a half-lie. Spending a lot of time on harder topics is pertinent to gaining a deeper understanding and appreciation, but time alone is not enough. Efficient spending of time is what's essential.

I've found that when I do stuff I find difficult (discrete mathematics let's say), I can spend 4 hours ""studying"" but  I actually only read the first line 37 times, and then glaze over the rest without taking it in. I'm not used to finding things difficult to understand, so in difficult subjects (like your algebra and biology) I get frustrated, anxious, unfocused etc and don't learn anything properly.

Take a long hard look at what you're actually achieving when you study for Algebra and Biology. I'd be willing to wager that it involves you trying to actually understand something you don't find immediately trivial, and not doing a particularly good job at it, unlike in World History where you're probably just pumping out some shitty last minute essay and getting an A-.

Non-stimulants gave me horrible nightmares. Or maybe the idea of taking medication every single day is abhorrent to them, I'm not sure. I chose not to have my thyroid removed because it works 50&amp;#37; of the time and I didn't want to rely on medication if I could get away with controlling it in other ways and I have for the last ten years. Sure it might come out eventually but I'll take ten years of not needing to take synthroid, you know? I take my ADHD meds, but I keep my dose low now, not because I judge people who take more but because more doesn't work better for me if we're judging ""betterness"" subjectively.

I know this stigma you're talking about. My mom is always suggesting I eat more nuts or some shit that drives me up a wall, but I also think you should consider whether or not you might be taking suggestions for alternatives personally and how you could free yourself from that feeling (because it's so hard on you, and really no one's business). As for this forum, plenty of us believe in meds and believe in this disorder and how debilitating it can be and still choose to pursue alternatives to medication like exercise and suggest them to people who seem to be looking to limit their reliance on drugs simply because the drugs have side effects or we have addiction issues or insurance problems or we're not interested in stimulant meds or whatever. Also remember that ADHD is a spectrum in the sense that some people have it very mild and others more severe, some of us can get away with coping mechanisms and other non-pharma options and others really do need the meds as you do.

I totally get it. I've been exactly where you are! I'm so sorry you're feeling judged!","e1gw3km",14,1530228346,"2018-06-28 23:25:46"

so seems like you are looking for a different activity that can give your brain a shot of dopamine.

the healthy suggestions people usually make are exercise and such.  do you play video games? they are a great dopamine source as they create ""reward"" points super frequently (there's a howtoadhd  video that explains this well).  so video games.

maybe giving yourself some dedicated time for such things would be useful?  i would imagine if you were wanking all the time and then went totally cold turkey you are probably at even more of a dopamine deficit than an adhd brain usually is!","fstwexq",1,1591248075,"2020-06-04 05:21:15"

"3378","My story:

I carefully read through every degree program the university I wanted to go to offered. I also considered future prospects... and I can't deny my parents opinion also influenced me, although I wish it hadn't. I managed to narrow it down to around 3 programs, and then just thought about those three, and at some point, one of them ..uh.. ""spoke to me""? Idk, I suddenly felt like this 1 program, let's call it subject A, was the right one.

Years pass, and half way through, I develop an intense interest in subject B. Since I'm already too far gone with subject A, and I don't want to quit, I go all through the master's program in in subject A, while getting my foot in the door of subject B, which eventually leads to me going for a PhD in subject B.

During the final year of the PhD in subject B, guess what happens, I ... develop an intense interest in subject C. Right now I'm about 6 months from finishing the PhD and also in the process of getting my foot in the door of subject C so I could change fields after graduation.

Conclusion: I fully accept the fact that I'm never going to stick to one thing, and that's totally fine, it keeps things interesting. I don't regret studying subject A at all. My one advice is, that in the likely event of you developing other interests during doing one thing, pick the interest that is at least tangentially related to your previous thing, so you can benefit from it. I mean, I also like subjects Z, Y, X etc., and although I'd really-really like to get into Z professionally, I just have to make smart choices and maybe keep just Z as a hobby.

Sure, getting distracted for a few seconds while berry picking may not be an issue, but for me it wouldn't just be a few seconds. I may think it was a few seconds, but it could easily have been hours. 

I get distracted even from fun and interactive activities. 

Considering the rate that I forget to eat (let's not even discuss going to the grocery store), I would probably not survive long if foraging was that I needed to do to get all my food. I have forgotten to eat for days at a time. If I don't take me meds I'm almost guaranteed to forget to eat breakfast or lunch, and dinner is 50/50. 

I've gotten myself dangerously dehydrated when off my meds because I was doing something and lost track of time, then suddenly it was 8 hours later.

If your pills have any lettering on then you can google the color, shape, and letters on google to see if the pill you have now is a different dosage than what you were prescribed, getting a pill that's a different color than normal, especially if it's the same size and shape, probably means that the wrong dosage was given to you, and should be a red flag for you to check it to make sure, companies don't just randomly change the colors based on batches or anything like that.","ckor0fn",4,1411335473,"2014-09-21 21:37:53"

I certainly don't think that they have multiple unconnected random thoughts popping in their head. They can choose if they want to think about nothing and turn off their thoughts.  
I also believe they have some sort of impulse that helps them prioritize, organize, plan. Maybe not an impulse, but something like having a clearer big picture and not easily forgetting about it and dwell into distractions.

WHERE IS IT!?!""  so I pull over and start tearing through my car, under the seat, around the console, nothing. so I vaguely remember that I put the debit card on the trunk as I was pumping (worst idea ever) so I head back, and first asked the attendant if they'd seen one or had a card turned in. nothing. so I start walking up and down a busy 4 lane highway. then it starts pouring rain. I walk like half a mile probably and back. thinking ""I'm so fucked. there's no talking your way out of this one. she's going to kick me out for sure."" almost to the point of tears I start looking near the station again and then I see it, laying in the parking lot, not 50 feet from the pump. it was a little scuffed after being ran over for 4 hours, but it was fine. she still got a little pissed when I told her, but she was glad I found it.

I had a lot of faults that were my own that I had to admit to, I was constantly defending myself and blaming my ADHD instead of taking responsibility and offering solutions. I am grateful to have him in my life because no one has ever taken the time get on my case, they just told me to take my medicine--which turns me into a different person. 

As far as focusing goes, I still have trouble--and sometimes when my attention diverts mid conversation he calls it rude. It hurts, I'm embarrassed and it's the one thing I feel I can't control. I'm thinking about going to psychotherapy, exercising and meditating to start increasing my ability to focus. But if anything, even if he misunderstands my ADHD, it still motivates me to fix it for myself, instead of just blaming my ADHD, because I'm NOT going back on medication and I can't just live with it.

I don't know how serious your relationship is, but in our first year of marriage we had a lot of trouble getting through this exact issue you are stating and we bought a book called ""ADHD and Marriage"". Of course we never finished it--not because it was a bad book but just reading the first chapter helped him acknowledge my ADHD was real and that we could work through it--with a bit of work--and we did.

So my advice is make sure he is ready to commit to you and ready work through this together as a team, both admitting your faults and moving forward--and if he's not into that the relationship doesn't have a chance of surviving what's to come.

"3423","Hey, you’re not a failure for not getting things done. You’re doing your best. It’s just that sometimes our best doesn’t feel like enough to even be called that. 

If you can, Try to ask yourself what’s getting in the way for you right now. Is a quiet house really what you need to focus? For myself, I know I can’t work in a quiet room. Headphones on or I’m gone. 

Either way, you’ll get better at regulating yourself as time goes on. But even then you’ll have off days and that’s okay. 

In the meantime be patient. Get to know what works for you. Be open with your dad about where you’re struggling. I once had a friend who also has ADHD tell me “I already have my teachers and parents getting frustrated with me. That’s enough frustration. I don’t need to add mine as well.” That stuck with me and I like to remember it when I’m getting frustrated with myself. I deserve a little patience, even if I’m the one who has to give it to myself. 

(Also- Especially if you’re still young it’s important that you don’t train yourself to think bad things about yourself. And you don’t even know how badly it messes you up if you let your brain fall into patterns of ‘oh a bad thing happened? I’m going to kill myself’. Your brain is constantly forming pathways and it’s kind of like a wagon going over a path over and over until it makes two deep fits in the ground making it harder to ever take a different path. It took a long time to train my brain out of the ‘any inconvenience can be solved with suicide’ despite that it only ever started as a half joking coping mechanism.)","fqb2d11",3,1589229366,"2020-05-11 20:36:06"

"3443","Go see your doctor.  You know yourself and body/mind better than anyone.  If you think that there is an underlying issue, then its your responsibility to talk to someone about it.  

Just a heads up, your Doctor may ask that you see a psychiatrist.

As far as your Wife and family goes, keep in mind that while she may not understand and her words hurt, along with the lack of support, that you already said that you feel like this is disrupting your life and hurting your family - let alone your career.  That, to me, says that you honestly care about your family.  So you need to do what you think is best for you - and in the long run, your life in general.

If this is ADD/ADHD there are unlimited resources at your disposal aside from medication (not saying you shouldn't take medication if you and your doctor decide that it may be for the best), and you can even ask your Wife to join you if you pursue some sort of counseling to learn about methods to help cope with symptoms: how to get and stay organized, learn 'tricks' to help you remember tasks/everyday things and also it can help remove the stigma that you keep experiencing.  

It can help your Wife understand you AND ADD/ADHD and what that means.  

ADD/ADHD doesn't mean you have to be on medication for the rest of your life.  Depending on the severity, you may be able to move on from medication after you learn the skills necessary for dealing with the symtpoms.

Everyone with ADD/ADHD is different - an individual.  

I guess the most important piece of advise I can offer is this:

If it is ADD/ADHD - don't let it define you.  You are not your ADD/ADHD, you are you.  

Also, even if you end up being on medication for the rest of your life - there is nothing wrong with that.  

ADD/ADHD is an illness - a disorder, just like any other disorder, in that treatment is often required into to take full advantage of and to reclaim your life.  You wouldn't mock someone who takes medication for depression everyday, or someone who needs medication for a heart condition.   

Treatment for disorders/illness is a tool.  Its a tool you can use to improve your quality of life.  Nothing more to it than that.

Try talking with your Wife again - communication is paramount in creating understanding - even if one side seems less than supportive at the time.  

What you want is to be happy, satisfied and in control of your life.  NOT to be medicated for the rest of your life.  Explain how that made you feel.  If it made you feel guilty, tell her.  If it hurt your feelings, tell her.  If it upset because you thought it was unfair, tell her.  Sometimes when we say things - we aren't always aware of the impact those words have on others - and they may not ever know if they're not told.  

And have patience with and faith in your partner.  Its hurtful that she isn't being supportive or seem to be trying to understand, but that doesn't mean that she'll always be like that.  It just might take time.

But in that time, you need to do you.  

someone told me once that a relationship can only be as happy as the happiest partner.  Meaning that while you guys are struggling now, if you can do you and improve the ways you want to - to better yourself and your family - it will effect your entire relationship/family.  

Now that you want to talk to someone about all of this, you are taking a step in the right direction to better yourself - to help yourself.  And that's HUGE.  Bravo!

TL;DR:  
-Talk to your Doctor, see whats up.  
-Keep open, honest communication with your Wife - sometimes when we don't understand certain things or aspects of our partners life, we can inadvertently hurt them, so keep open communication and be honest about how things make you feel.
-There is nothing wrong with being on medication - sometimes its necessary, even if only temporary, to improve quality of life.
-Counseling can be helpful for both you and your Wife when talking about ADD/ADHD and what that means
-Good for you for seeking advice/help from your doctor!  Even if i'm just some random person on the internet, I'm proud of you!  Go you!

"3453","ADD and anxiety and depression are all parts of the same system, IMHO. They are dealing with the interplay of the big 3 neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and neuroICanNeverSpellThisOne).

Personally, I feel like there is a broken pipe in my brain. The pipe is full of energy to attend to the things I need to attend to. But it’s smashed, so the energy just pours out and pools up into this huge ball of almost subconscious anxiety. At the same time, my consciousness is standing at the other end trying to get shit done, and it keeps whacking the pipe asking where all the energy it needed for the attention has got to?

And then the process of fighting inattention and anxiety all day just leaves me joyless and tired by the end of the day.

So I get this lovely trifecta from a single broken pipe.

I’m convinced that if You knew enough neurochemistry you could find some defective protein that fails to convert some energy molecule from a form where it can be used in one portion of the brain to a form where it can be used in the attention center.

Ritalin is like pouring gasoline into the carburetor to prime the engine. So maybe the pipe isn’t shattered, maybe it’s just really leaky.

"3456","My initial shrink was pro-IR for college age students because of the flexibility with dosing with a varied class schedule and work schedule to balance. He was big on emphasizing the burst style of efficiency rather than trying to force-develop a steady trend. 

My sister was on XR stuff which I tried and did not like at all. She actually switched after trying the IR stuff. It does just feel different. 

My current shrink (I moved, and I just couldn’t continue driving 100 miles just because I liked my old one) didn’t have an issue with continuing. He was a little biased of Adderall over Ritalin when I asked to try it but we had a discussion and then he wrote me a script for both - which I was extremely shocked about. 

I asked what do I do with which ever one I didn’t like, do I need to come back and return the script, and he responded no, just don’t fill it. I mean, I feel like both of my psychiatrists didn’t have me pegged as an abuse potential and stuff like that just surprised me.

I am not joking, it does not matter how old you are. If you have poor impulse control, trying to lock a fun thing behind work Just Doesn’t Work Reliably. I can just have candy, play games, or watch tv NOW. It is in no way related to the task. 

The sticker chart is rewarding, but it isn’t something you just want to do. No adult wants to throw stickers in a line next to “laundry goddamn you” for fun, which means you won’t do the reward instead of the task. The sticker chart serves as a reminder, a win record, AND a reward all at once. 

I’m sure there are other ways of externalizing rewards that are more related to tasks. For example: I get to take a nice bath if I clean the bathtub first. Or, I get to do some bonkers makeup if I clean my makeup brushes. The more related a reward is to the task, the better off you will be.

Could you cut down any expenses in your daily life? For example groceries, clothing, repayments on things, bills (do you have the best plan for phones etc).

"3487","The behavior you're describing is not attributable to ADHD, at least not to the extent that you've described. It is, however, *incredibly common* in patients with Borderline Personality Disorder [\[ 1 \]](https://sarahmyles.net/2013/07/22/borderline-personality-disorder-and-the-chameleon-effect/). There is significant comorbidity between BPD and ADHD (~25% IIRC) so it wouldn't be surprising if you had both. There is also significant overlap in the symptoms of ADHD and BPD [\[ 2 \]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24901317/) [\[ 3 \]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4739390/#!po=72.5962) [\[ 4 \]](https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40479-018-0086-8), so it can be difficult for doctors to correctly identify when patients have both disorders.  
  
Fun fact: ""Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria"" is a term that was originally coined to refer to behavioral patterns in patients with BPD [\[ 5 \]](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/Z01-MH002188-02)
\[ 6 \]](https://books.google.com/books?id=jhtvBV3i0rkC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342&amp;dq=%22rejection+sensitive+dysphoria%22+%22borderline%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vloNeT8f7a&amp;sig=b-GFYtixppr5XnRgc1g5O3Vd90U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK2cDq7vLJAhUFUKYKHUgfDE0Q6AEIPDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rejection%20sensitive%20dysphoria%22%20%22borderline%22&amp;f=false). Dr. William Dodson later co-opted the term and applied it to ADHD, but thus far his only ""evidence"" has been his own anecdotal clinical experience. There is zero scientific evidence to support Dodson's idea that RSD is a separate condition distinguishable from BPD.  
  
To be clear, I'm not saying that identifying with the concept of RSD automatically means you have BPD. Many of the ""symptoms"" of Dodson's RSD could be attributed to emotional dysregulation, something which has been observed in both ADHD and BPD.  
  
What I *am* saying is that the concept of RSD was initially created to describe people with BPD, and there's no credible evidence that it occurs in ADHD alone. Since ADHD and BPD are quite often comorbid, it is highly likely that some people who believe they have RSD are actually dealing with undiagnosed BPD.  
  
**tl;dr - This type of behavior isn't part of ADHD, but it's often part of BPD. ADHD and BPD share many symptoms and are often comorbid. RSD actually originated from BPD research; there's no evidence that it occurs in ADHD alone. In some cases ""ADHD RSD"" is a harmless misnomer for emotional dysregulation; in others it's a dangerously misleading term for  comorbid BPD.

"3493","10 mg is a very small dose so you might not notice anything actually. But you probably will if/when you up the dosage later on. Then you will probably feel a but dizzy or nauseated. Maybe a head ache and a bit of tenseness too. But that will probably pass after a day or two! But it will probably come back for a little while every time you up the dosage.

And then everyday stuff. Keep a water bottle with you, because you'll get thirsty. (I actually like that side effect because I always used to forget to drink enough before.)

It will probably make you feel less hungry, so you'll want smaller portions. And after a while you'll get used to that so even when you haven't taken your meds you probably won't eat very large meals. Compensate for this by eating small snacks often. 

I have started eating apple slices with peanut butter (the good kind, that's natural. Not the kinds with lots of extra crap in it! And in reasonable amounts of course.). I think it is easy to eat and peanutbutter has a lot of good stuff in it, like protein, magnesium and the kind of fat that is good for your body, etc. And the apple slices are good because you're supposed to eat a fruit everyday. 

I usually eat half an apple around 10 am and then I eat the other half around 3 pm. And sometimes as a compliment to dinner. Some days I really just dont have the appetite to eat a whole meal for dinner, so then I'll eat half a meal and afterwards I'll eat an apple with peanutbutter to compensate","dqepthl",2,1511797556,"2017-11-27 15:45:56"

I thought the teachers were just bad (I guess I'm a bit arrogant in that regard; I just thought I was smart, therefore there was no way it's my fault I'm doing poorly). Then, I kept struggling the next semester. At that point, I thought I just needed better strategies and simply didn't know ""how to college"" yet. Yet I still struggled. Finally, over the summer, I took 4 hours (instead of 8, which is considered full time over the summer). I spent almost all my time on that one class and STILL ended up dropping it. At that point, I just figured I was dumb.

Talked to my sister, and her ADHD came up. I'd known she had it but it never clicked; she was a late diagnosis, so it wasn't a thing growing up. Knowing nothing about ADHD, I looked it up, and I found myself PRAYING that I did have it so that I'd have an answer to my problem. Went and got diagnosed, and I'm doing much better now.

"3498","When they say they can't prescribe, ask if they can recommend someone who can.

Ask your GP too, your GP likely has some patients on ADHD meds and knows what psychiatrists can treat ADHD (I found mine via a recommendation from my GP).

Also consider seeing a therapist who lists ADHD as a specialty. They also may know which psychiatrists on your area can prescribe for ADHD.

Finally, do a little reading on Provigil/modafinil. It's approved for daytime sleepiness, not ADHD, but there have been some studies that show it helping with ADHD. Provigil is such a low concern for abuse (schedule 4 in the US, and not a controlled substance at all in most other countries) that it is often prescribed by GPs. Your psychiatry practices that ""don't prescribe controlled substances"" likely really mean ""don't prescribe schedule 2 substances"" (they are almost definitely prescribing schedule 3s for some of their anxiety patients) so they could probably do Provigil too.","fckg2l9",1,1577724533,"2019-12-30 16:48:53"

I'm 23 years old myself and there is quite a bit to my story honestly.. Being blunt, I have NEVER had academic success to me.. it has always been impossible to do homework. It has been impossible to not procrastinate. It has been impossible to focus on anything.

I don't believe that is an issue of my symptoms only showing up now that I am 23. I just grew up and never knew the difference. I mean things that seem as  clear as day to me being the tell-tale sign of a problem were at the time.. just some minor annoyance. I use to day dream in class.. I mean every. Single. Class. I. Have. Ever. Taken. 

Teachers  and my parents have always said I was just lazy which I really don't buy anymore.. When I got to college and I tried harder than I have ever tried in my life.. and every singe study session I set up resulted in me being able to sit down and study I kinda started to realize something.

My parents are fucken retarded. They have bitched about grades my entire life, asked me if I wanted to be put in special ed at one point, and berated me my entire life because I couldn't make a C average.  And they never, EVER bothered to go get me checked for jack shit. I never had a steady tutor and I never really had been able to focus.

I feel pretty safe in saying I am at least average intelligence. (Although my writing skills are a bit lacking I must admit.) In fact, most of the students in the high school I went to thought I had straight As for some reason..

I was socially awkward through most of elementary/middle school.. I didn't have many friends because people found it weird I changed topics so randomly.. Like one time in class a guy asked ""seriously? where the fuck did that comment just come from?""

I'm 23, and have done poorly my entire school life. I've been in college 5 years and honestly.. It took a lot for me to really get a grasp on the fact that part of the reason I've had so much trouble in all the different things I do in life is because I can't pay attention... I mean even in things which are my hobbies I have trouble really getting into at times..

This isn't something I discuss very casually, nor is it something I use as a one sized fits all excuse for my mistakes in the past. It is however, something that I've come to realize is a major part of my life. I would not have intentionally spent the last 5 years in college and still be no where near graduating, nor would I have pissed tops (a scholar ship program in my state) out the window by fucking up in highschool the way I ended up doing if I had any other options at all.","c4apzvt",3,1334094485,"2012-04-10 21:48:05"

"3528","I've been there. Actually, I kinda still am. I had to self diagnose before seeking help. I thought I was depressed, anxious, dyslexic, autistic, bipolar, and so on. However, nothing ever fit the bill so I thought it was some independent problem that I had to work through myself. ADHD was the only thing that I related to 100%.

As for the self diagnosing phase... I also was very fixated on how much the symptoms translated to my daily life. It finally felt like I had answers, so I couldn't help but overshare with my friends. The difference between before and after realizing it could be ADHD is that I was confused to hell about my behavior. I constantly yell at myself internally for not doing what needs to be done. Now that I know there are reasons behind it, I can understand myself better and be able to forgive myself. 

I don't think of it as giving up if I forgive myself. Ever hear of the ""Wall of  Awful""?

"3536","Yeah I'll figure something out hopefully. It's just strange how my brain works. I'm great at math and science and writing and stuff like that but I really just don't do well with history, geography, and politics. I'm not sure why. I joke that I'm ""slow"" to people when it takes me longer to figure things out but I definitely do feel like I have a learning disability despite my good grades. I think maybe I'm just bad at keeping track of people, dates, and stuff like that and how I'm supposed to react to things since I have a difficult time forming reactions to a lot of things. I wish that everything was easily laid out cut and dried for me to look at. Maybe that's the problem. If I'm interested in learning more about chemistry or something I could find a book that lists a bunch of facts and it just makes perfect sense because the information is all just really straightforward and really isn't open to interpretation and there isn't any bias or voice being used by the author. So it's not complicated to comprehend for me. Same with math. It's all facts and so it's easy to follow. Whenever I have to deal with material that isn't 100% factual and neatly presented it just confuses me. 

Maybe I just don't care about current events but I don't think I would call it that. It's more like I'm not sure how to care because I just wind up feeling confused with a headache. I had a course about a year and a half ago where we had to read news stories during class and discuss them and it gave me a migraine once and then after that the professor thought I had a major migraine problem and would never call on me since I always looked uncomfortable.

"3553","Depends on the people around me and the topic at hand. If it's a topic I don't know much about I listen and ask questions if I have any. 

On the other hand if it's a topic I am interested in I will talk your ear off. 

When the topic turns into ""this vs. that"" I go two ways with it. If it's a friend I will lay out my arguments for why I believe ""this"" and go back and forth. 

If it's a person I don't know I just let them talk and keep my views to myself unless specifically asked. I value respectful dialogue and far too many people just want to bulldoze you with their views without even wanting to hear what you have to say. 

When you care about a certain topic, I find that there is a LOT of nuance that needs to be teased out. People that want to ""win"" a conversation don't allow you the space to lay out your arguments. Tbh I don't blame them, it's a hard skill to acquire. I've slowly learned over the years how to temper my enthusiasm and not speak over people (for the most part, still a learning process). I just find conversations MUCH more enjoyable when you give and receive respect.

I feel the way you feel whenever I start learning something new. Then over the years I get comfortable with the subject because of the work I put in to grapple with the subject.

Pro tip - Ask people about their insights on the topic. For example, when I got into powerlifting I asked a friend what three things he wished he knew when starting out.

Do you have a work environment in which someone can work in quiet? I know a lot of small start ups use a very small, open space which is wonderful for collaborations and meetings and terrible if you're trying to focus on doing work on your own. 

My solution is to use headphones and isolate myself to an area where I can look at a wall rather than catch glimpses of people walking by or listening to other conversations. You may want to provide these small, individual focused workspaces as it improves productivity among all employees. It's great when you're small. You can establish your work culture and it can change more easily than a large organization. Flexible work time and work place is very helpful not only to those with ADHD but also to improve work-life balance and employee satisfaction.

Likewise, smaller goals on projects with shorter deadlines is very helpful (even for those that don't have ADHD). Think about what feedback - good and bad - that you're giving your employees and how often.

"3595","There is a great book (don't let the cheesy cartoon cover art deceive you) called something like ""Tips and tricks for women with ADHD""

It should be unisex really. It is filled with this kind of stuff -things that I never attributed to ADHD.

I only remember a few:

-Burns on your hands/forearms. From reaching into an oven and trying to ""just quickly grab"" the item, because your too impatient to take the time to put oven mitts on.

-Burning food ALWAYS. Because ""it only needs 5 more mins. so I don 't need to set a timer for that...""

-Chronically late to everything. Because we're trying to cram in too much stuff. ""Time-blind.""

-Terrible spellr.

-Beyond misplacing house keys. Leaving them in house door/car door.

-Toast left in toaster oven for days.
Also coffee/tea left in microwave.

-Half finished beverages scattered around the house. 

-One single shaved leg/arm pit one left hairy. Because you got distracted in shower.

-Tidy and obsessively ordered tiny space like say; linen closet. Yet completely messy totally jacked rest of house.

-Lots of boxes of random shit marked ""sort"" ...from 2012 or earlier.

-Cupboards/drawers left open.

-Driving away with shit on your car roof.

-You're in your 30s yet still can't get  Left/Right correct when giving/getting directions. Often point instead... but still fuck it up regardless. (Really angry looks from friends and ""what are you 5?!"" comments ...as they are made to turn the car around.

-Writes (not types) in all caps.

-Cuts ""itchy pokey"" labels out of all shirts. Can't wear certain socks if the seams are too ""bulky"" or not alined.

-Interrupts all the time, because if you don't blurt it out -it's gone forever. 

There are hundreds more... 
Wow, I just realized these are all negative attributes. I'd like to add that even though there are more negatives in ""quantity""...I feel like the positives of ADHD should be weighted for ""quality"". 

I remember once being especially frustrated and exclaiming  ""I hate my brain!"" and my boyfriend at the time, telling me that he loved my brain and it was the most special, weird and wonderful brain he's ever met.

"3596","Just throwing this out there in response to 

&gt;I think that one of the things that's killing me the most is that I think that I'm becoming bored in our relationship. We sit around and watch TV or do homework,

I was recently feeling similar, how things are so routine in my realtionship as of late. However, as much as I love going to the beach, long walks, and spontaneous adventures it's also 6 degrees outside. Frankly, being inside rather than venturing outside this time of year is just plain practical. 

And so this bring me too..... Could this boredom possibly be seasonally related at all? Just a thought when I saw that. 

As for often fighting over the same issues, over and over is a bigger issue. The ""thrill"" can subside over time in relationships and it's up the the couple to keep things thriving. If you can't calmly talk about the problems and issues you have together, and no matter what you do, you keep fighting, what are you fighting for? You can have a partner you don't bicker with over the same thing all the time. Talking about issues calmly, moving on(not nagging), not being quick to anger, communication, these I think are very are important, necessary parts of a realtionship.

I cut my hair... Like... I cut it myself... I fried my ends a bit fixing my hair, and my hair was crazy overdue for a trim anyways but I hadn't had the time. My hair was also still longer in Front than back from my days of having an A-line bob. Last night I touched up the black in my hair and put a fresh layer of blue in my bangs/front, and once that was done, I brushed the hell outta my hair and while it was wet, I just started cutting. I started slow and small and went from there. It's a bit shorter than I planned (although I only took like 2-3 inches off) but its all the same length now, and it's even actually!!! The back is NOT wonky and I actually did a good job. I touched up the sides/front/upper back a bit to make it a little more choppy with layers to help thin it a little because I have overly thick hair, but also it helps give my hair a little body when straightened without being thick and Afro-y.. :)

"3622","Well, I’m 23, so it’s somewhat of a late diagnosis. I used to think I had straight up anxiety, mixed with narcolepsy or something (long story, apparently adhd can cause a lot of fatigue symptoms in some and this can be mistaken for narcolepsy) and my troubles with focus cane more from the whole disorganized section of adhd. None of these things are what you think of when you think of adhd.

I used to be knee deep in denial about it too. I began snapping at people that would point out my adhd traits, a very “Don’t have a problem- YOURE the problem, you’re uptight, you’re annoying” someone with a phychology degree once mentioned she figured I had adhd and I broke down crying (I wasn’t ready to know at that point) and pushed her away. I began protecting myself with an ego. This ego protected me, but having a large ego lost me friends. People began to believe that I did have everything together (because I kept pushing the narrative that I was fine) and began to see my forgetfulness and lack of listening skills as not caring. Even my parents began to wonder if I was a sociopath. (I’m not I was just an egotistical adhd person with ASD traits)

I went to a councilor about my anxiety. This was a big step for me. It can be hard to organize that kind of stuff when you’re like this. Also, My parents are a little backwards about mental health, so it was tough. I learned coping skills for my anxiety, and to be able to recognize how I feel, because I learned I was not very in touch with myself. This is an important life skill, I’m my opinion. Nobody knows you better than yourself, but you have to look at yourself.

I noticed that although I had worked through a lot of anxiety and confidence issues- the focus stuff was still not there. I always just thought everything would fall in line if only I could manage my anxiety. And that’s when I knew. Something was up. I knew that when I go to live on my own properly as an adult, I will struggle and fail because of my lack of organization in this area. Before this I would rely on parents or college friends, but I can’t do this forever. I don’t even want to rely on others for this- I want to develop my own skills in this area. But of course- I had tried everything. I made lists. Diets. Exercise. Routines. Vitamins. Everything.

The final straw was when this area of my life started causing more mental illness and depression. I would get a task and - depression. I had never been depressed before this. I don’t have full on depression- but my inability to focus was causing hopelessness, fear and too much stress. 

So I phoned a specialist. I didn’t wait for someone else to figure it out. I just knew. It’s always been a problem. It’s messing up my life and I knew it. So when she gave me the diagnosis it wasn’t shocking. I already knew really.

Anyone can feel free to disagree with me, but don’t wait for someone else to point out you have an issue and tell you. You will know. If it’s f*cking up your life, and your life would be better if you weren’t like that, and you (definitely) can’t fix it yourself, then get up and find the person that can help you. For adhd, this person is a phychiatrist or a neurologist. 

There are other ways to go about this, such as go to a doctor, they send you to another doctor, and they send you to a specialist, but in my opinion this is a lengthy process for something you could just already know by knowing yourself and trusting what you see in yourself.","fokyj8p",2,1587851389,"2020-04-25 21:49:49"

"3674","Ahhhh gotchya. Hard times have a way of amplifying that kind of thought. I definitely can relate to that. Us ADHD folk are also pretty good at picking ourselves apart by thinking about all the things wrong with us, what we could have done differently, why that one decision was so stupid, how will this butterfly effect lead to this and that and options abc. It can be pretty easy to turn that on ADHD itself and then yikes, we've just attacked a fundamental part of ourselves.

I donno. Sometimes I feel like we spit on all the things that shows and books for kids were wise enough to tell us when we were little. Even the best of us make mistakes. We're all imperfect. There is not a thing in the world we can do to be perfect. It's easy to find what's wrong with us. It's like throwing a dart at the ground. You'll never miss (there's a Douglas Adams joke in here somewhere).

That ADHD part of you that you find weakness in.. I bet there's a lot there that contributes to your strengths as well. It's a lot harder to look for. Trust me on that, but it's likely there, and a lot more than you'd think.

Haha! I think you hit a lot of people in a tender area. I'll admit the thought has crossed my mind before. But really, if no one ever mentioned ADHD to me for my whole life I'd only be left with my choices. I did pretty well for the 28 years I went untreated, chaotic as they might have been. We're blessed and cursed with this intense allergic reaction to boredom and that can make for an exciting life and exciting thoughts if we can just be normal enough to get by \*wink\* while we make our way. 

Either way, hard times are hard. I hate to hear that you've been having a rough time of it. I hope it gets better for you. I believe it will, for what that's worth. I don't have to know you to believe in you \^\_\^","ga1bxq0",1,1603619800,"2020-10-25 09:56:40"

Now, about being impatient, i'll be honest, not everyone is able to deal with ADHD distracted and sometimes careless lifestyle, even when we fight it  some things will continue happening, even if with smaller frequency but it still happens. If you want a solution, try to stablish a routine with him so it become less of an effort and more of an automatic thing, creating routines is hard and will demand time and effort, but it's the way to achieve significant change of lifestyle / fix carelessness.

"3679","While everyone's brain is as different as a thumb print, dopamine irregularity is generally accepted as a root cause of ADHD (someone please clarify if that's off). Glucose provides a jolt to this system in the brain, so the ADHD mind is often attracted to it. With medication the irregularity is improved such that the brain isn't starved for stimulation.

It's a DISABILITY which, like many of the disabilities, can lead to positive changes in your perspective, but it doesn't stop it from being a disability and a handicap.

"3684","Wow what you have achieved is remarkable, considering the obstacles you faced. The in decisiveness sounds like a manifestation of anxiety. Anxiety doesn't always look or feel like feel. Sometimes when I'm anxious express it as anger. It sounds like you have gone through a huge transition. We are creatures of habit, it's so hard for us not to have a routine.  You are juggling a lot so I think getting really organized is the first thing,  sit down and look over your syllabi - are there due dates for assignments/tests already? If so put them all in 
to a calender, I like gmail because it's so easy to edit from my phone. 

Make sure you are actively taking yourself emotionally. It's sounds like you have been through a lot of trauma, you have had some really difficult experiences, and you need to process those and heal. Make sure you make a little time to have fun, and give you're brain a break. Exercising makes a huge difference for me, I'm way less anxious when I go to the gym regularly. 

While your in the stage of figuring out your routine. Overestimate everything, if you think X task will take 3 hours, plan for 5hours. That way you have room for error. Then reassess as you go. 

Reach out to your school. ADHD is federally protected under the Americans w/ Disabilities Act. You are entitled to reasonable accommodations, use them. See if you can get extra time on exams, or get access to an organizational couch, ask then what services are available to you as a student.

For some reason I've managed to consistently be able to do it in this setting specifically.

"3688","It sounds like you fit right in! Now turn off the computer and get back to work! :-P

But in all seriousness - if you truly have ADHD, and by your description it sounds like you do*, you are in the perfect place in your life to take charge of it. There isn't a single day that goes by that I don't wish I had been diagnosed before college. I had the exact same problems that you described as long as I can remember - I did really well on exams, but was unable to do any kind of homework/studying/reading, no matter how easy the task or how determined to ""make this semester different."" This was fine and dandy through high school and even Freshman year of college, though there quickly becomes a point where you can't get by on just going to lectures. 

There are countless tips and strategies for coping with and harnessing ADHD, and it is never a bad thing to learn more, though I highly suggest you start the conversation with your psychiatrist. In my college experience, it is very easy to start a semester confident, miss a class/assignment/reading, fall behind on lecture material, promise myself I'll catch up (usually to no avail), do poorly on an exam, then steadily spiral down until I end up barely passing/failing altogether, or just drop the class. I am now starting my sixth year and third major. Now I'm probably an extreme case since I wasn't aware of my diagnosis until mid June (this summer), but if my failures can give you or anyone reading the courage to seek treatment, I'm happy.

Fun fact of the day: You touched on it, but often times fast paced jobs, such as retail, are great for people with ADHD (especially with hyperactivity) because you are required to constantly jump from task to task - your tendency to know everything that is going on in the room is actually advantageous! (Complete Idiot's Guide to Adult ADHD - surprisingly actually a really informative book!)

Wow, apparently I decided to write a short novel haha! Sorry for the unwarranted advice. Anyways, I wish you the best of luck in school and life! :-D Kick some butt this semester!

"3712","I'm always afraid of something like this.

Even after I have my records transfer they still have to ""follow protocol"" and have me sign a ""Doctor Shopping"" agreement or something brand new that month.

This is all so funny. When I was in 3rd grade I was diagnosed but this was after I had traveled an hour away three times a week to a city that had a competent child psychologist who was doing research on the subject. She helped a lot and throughout the years it was great. I always explain this to each doctor I meet to let them know where I stand and how far I've come. If anyone tries to treat it like you're accountable for someone else's job or procedure just tell them they're talking about who you are, rather than a protocol.

When I became an adult (according to my family you're an adult at 15) it got weird. I ""couldn't see her anymore"" because I wasn't a child (my moms words not mine) so I had to start seeing a regular family doctor. They were okay and they still coordinated with my CP but they were weird to interact with and didn't really know anything (they differed to the CP a lot).

However, I found out other things about being responsible for these new ""adult level"" meds. Things like being required to go pick up the script in person (by hand) and show my ID and sign for the script at the doctors office. Then I had to take it to the pharmacy, show my ID and sign again. Then when I picked up I'd always get the gamut… Birthday (standard), confirm address (standard), what are you picking up? Milligrams? Doctor who prescribed? Make sure the name on the card matches your ID and matches the name for the script and the account used for the purchase. 

So many people don't know about schedule drug regulations and some of the places made me sign all these protective forms but almost let me leave stating they'd call the prescription over… and I'd have to explain the process to them even though this is their job.

Don't forget that you can't actually fill a script until x amount of days close to the total qty of the pills in the bottle. 

Oh, and never-mind that I'm 33 and a freaking adult and have been taking this for more than 20 years for crap sake.

Also, never-mind that most of these are put in place for people who DON'T have trouble doing all of the above on an inherent basis without medication. I'm not saying I use it as a crutch but if they think someone can go cold turkey off of a stimulant drug without it affecting their work, life, and still follow up on protocols, etc. then they're not fit to call themselves a medical professional.

I finally found a doctor who has a company that is forward thinking. They have an app and an interface with the pharmacies so they can send over scripts by thumbprint and all I have to do is call in the day of (or before) to get it filled. The only inconvenience is if I've screwed up and failed to get a script (they send it 3 months at a time and sometimes I forget to make the mandatory in person visit ahead of time and then it takes a while to get an appointment -- which sucks).

I'm ranting. I think I'll stop here.

"3723","The biggest issue in terms of inequality within *individual* relationships is this idea of 50/50 as applied to individual tasks, for example, taking out the trash half of the time; this is a mistake, this only results in being in each other's way, frustration, and resentment. Division of labor done right has one person always taking out the trash, while the other always does something else, thus avoiding the aforementioned problems. The assembly line was predicated on this forgotten ethos.

Moreover, ""full time"" just means 35 hours or more, there isn't a cap, which is why men who work full time put in 15% more hours than women who work full time, *on average*. Additionally, it's worth considering what one does with that time, as the rest of the gender *earnings* gap is predicated on the female privilege of missing the social responsibility of *financially* supporting others, which allows them to make job decisions based on things like comfort, personal fulfillment, flexibility, benefits, etc., rather than their bottom line.

As for spending, the house itself is included (91%), while I kinda doubt many women would accept ""we both benefit from the car"" as an argument in defense of spending more on the M package, or what have you, despite having previously spent more on a breakfast nook, or some other unnecessary feature.

That said, I don't even think the average man has an issue working longer or harder hours in a higher stress or danger job, I don't even think many of them need recognition for it, but criticism for neglecting to do even more crosses a line.

EDIT: Quick clarification, that 85% isn't based on relationships, it's based on society, it takes into account single people. My friend Ben bought a house when he was single (engineering wins), that was part of the 9% women don't control. When it comes to couples and/or families, women probably control near 100% of home purchases, and much more than 65% of car purchases. If men had that much purchasing power manufacturers would still sell their fast wagons (because it *is* a family purchase) in America... but they don't, they sell minivans.","e0ng795",-4,1528967957,"2018-06-14 09:19:17"

"3726","Can you be more specific on WHAT aspect of ADD affects you/makes you seek meds?

For example I have no learning issues but I am the ""innatentive"" type the first Dr I tried, doubted me and the second gave me Adderall 10mg IR as I wanted in the first place.

I had none of the ""euphoria"" people talk about, I am still hungry (but eat less), what it really did was it focused my thoughts. I noticed for example I can now work on the translation work I do and not have 10 tabs at the same time. I can take a break and actually remember where I was in the work I was doing. I can do dishes without having to check my phone every 5 minutes or take breaks to do something else. 

In other words, I WORKS wonders for me because it helps me focus. The other bizarre and wonderful effect is that I am more CALM than I have ever been in my entire life and I lost the anxiety I didn't even know I had (I used to overthink everything and my thoughts were never ""still""... )My posture improved instantly and my shoulders relaxed. Now I am present, and in the moment and my thoughts are not going back and forth.

I was able to tell because I took Adderall in the middle of a huge project I was truly struggling with and I was able to tell. My suggestion to you is, maybe go do the thing that is the hardest to you and see if it has changed.  Also, try taking more than what the doctor prescribed -  I did that and found the right dosage myself. I found that 20mg is what works best for me, somewhere between 20-25mg/day IR. (I can't afford the XR Adderall as I have no insurance)

Because although the effects are dramatic to me, they are extremely suble - I only notice them because it I was working on something that I struggled with and that I knew I had problems with.  I had no magic ""buzz"" or mood changes otherwise.

In your case, though, if you DID NOT have ADD I'd think you'd actually get the ""buzz"" people seek. I read that ppl who don't have ADD get very hyper on Adderall which is the opposite of what happened to me.   So, if you felt nothing, maybe your dosage is too low.

"3778","I'm in the US so I don't know if it's different, but here's my story.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at 49. I had strongly suspected I had it for at least 5 years before that but I was afraid to bring it up. 

I remember seeing news reports about people saying they had ADHD to get Adderall so they could preform better at work. Some Doctors would prescribe it without proper diagnosis. 

The DEA or FDA was cracking down and the Doctor could lose their licence. 

I was scared as hell to bring it up. I figured I had one shot at it and if the doctor thought I was trying to scam for drugs I was done. I understood if I would start asking other Doctors I would be labeled as a drug seeker. 

For 44 years my brain had been warped by all the cool super powers that ADHD gives you. Thinking clearly and logically is not one of them.

I waited another 5 years until I felt I was at the end of my rope. I listed all the problems I was having but did not tell her I thought I had ADHD. It's the Doctors job to diagnose, besides it could have been something else. 

The Doctor said, in a pissed off tone ""this is a family practice, why are you coming here for ADHD, you need to see a Psychiatrist!"" I thought I was done, all my fears came true. She (still pissed off) ask if I had one. No. She offered to find one for me. Good, I wasn't done yet. In the end I saw the on site Councilor. She reviewed my answers on the questionnaire and ask me for some other information. She told the Doctor she felt I had it and I was diagnosed and am being treated.

I think it's unethical the way some Doctors treat patients that are coming to them for help with a mental illness. I could have been receiving treatment at least 5 years prior to that if I wasn't afraid to bring it up because of stories like yours.  

The other problem is being diagnosed with any mental illness. Between the way society views it and having a diagnosis like that on your record people end up suffering with problems that in a lot of cases can be easily controlled.  

Your GP doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground. I don't know your options in the UK but you need to see someone who has  the knowledge to properly diagnose. I'm sure you'll get some good advise here. I wish you the best, don't give up.","cstyaal",1,1436201166,"2015-07-06 16:46:06"

Unfortunately my sister doesn’t share that opinion I guess. I spoke to my brother in-law this morning, asking him how he would like me to handle E’s behavior when it comes to my kids. He said to say nothing, he and my sister don’t want E to feel like people are picking on him.  I just got done telling my kids that if E behaves in a way they don’t like then they are to walk away and tell an adult. I told them this applies to anyone that makes them feel uncomfortable, if you ask someone to please stop and they refuse to then it’s your choice to remove yourself from the situation. I think I’ve been so focused on teaching my kids to be nice people that I haven’t done a very good job at teaching them to stand up for themselves or at least realize they don’t have to accept crap from others. I feel bad for E, trying to talk to him so he can learn proper socializing skills seems like it would be less traumatic then having to make my kids avoid him and him not really realizing why.

"3844","I have social anxiety - I can't usually get through an episode of the Office. I have to leave the room. Sometimes in an awkward real-life situation my brain just shuts down, overpowered by waves of *un*-thought. This, more than any physical fear, has prevented me from acting in situations where I really would have wanted to stand up for something: simply the idea of someone else's disapproval, judgment or antipathy has left me paralyzed.

Beyond that, I live a pretty stress-free life. When I was unmedicated and unemployed, I always fought the idea that I was clinically depressed - it was my actual life that sucked, not my perception of it. Since beginning my Strattera regimen and turning my life around, my enjoyment of life on &amp; off meds has increased profoundly. This would bear out my theory, but I am aware that Strattera is a form of reuptake inhibitor, like most antidepressants. It works on norepinephrine and not seratonin but the principle is the same.

All the same, I believe anxiety and depression aren't tied to ADHD. Rather, it's the daily trials and overall, lifelong lack of success that ADHD can cause that leads to feeling worried or worn out. Textbook clinical depression and anxiety, in my understanding, occur when someone with a successful life still can't enjoy it. More likely, I think it is those who have been diagnosed with ADHD who are more likely to uncover symptoms of depression and anxiety, and vice versa, which is a critical distinction from comorbidity. Those who fear or neglect to seek diagnosis or treatment for one will do the same for others, causing the appearance of correlation.","c9klhxm",2,1366675009,"2013-04-22 23:56:49"

I wouldn’t approach a general practitioner for a referral saying I have diagnosed myself as having “x” disorder and want to be tested.  That could be construed that you are trying to get a certain type of medication.

On a side note, I'm confused about how there is no doctor in your entire state that will take the insurance you have.

"3933","A lot of the offices I looked at were telehealth only (I started looking around the end of June, made an appointment in the beginning of August). It took some time but I found one that was in person. I didn’t feel comfortable having a telehealth appointment in my home, had never been to a psychiatrist before, and was honestly worried I wouldn’t be able to properly convey my struggles through a video chat. There were too many obstacles that I thought could waste time and ultimately delay (or make me put off) treatment. 

With that said, I have no experience with telehealth diagnosis myself but I have seen people on this sub talk about being diagnosed and prescribed that way during Covid. I’m guessing prescribing medication via telehealth depends on insurance and the laws where you live. 

My diagnosis was actually quick and painless. I explained what I was struggling with and he asked follow up questions. We talked about my family and work and what college was like, etc. After 20 minutes he had his diagnosis. No tests (to my surprise) and only one appointment. I was ready for battle but I didn’t need to fight at all. Maybe he would’ve required another session or tests if he wasn’t sure. Or maybe he was comfortable with ADHD and could spot it a mile away. Who knows. 

I do not know what your insurance requires in order to cover treatment or what the psychiatrist you see will need to feel confident in a diagnosis, but what I do know is that there is no clinical standard for diagnosing ADHD. Even tests and scans aren’t foolproof. I think you should look at other psychiatrists. If you run into another one that requires testing, ask them if they insist that tests be completed in order to make a diagnosis. You want to know their reasoning behind that. If they tell you there’s no other way to know, they’re lying. Tests can be useful for many reasons including getting to know the way your brain works. But since they aren’t part of a medical or clinical standard for diagnosis, you can still get an accurate diagnosis without taking them. Tests should be used as additional data to factor into a diagnosis, not as a required step.","g4zsn5q",2,1599950769,"2020-09-12 22:46:09"

"3938","Yeah of course! I take adderall instant release and a mood stabilizer now (I don't think this combination is prescribed very often). I also found the right birth control to help with the hormone problems (which is apparently relatively common with ADHD). I feel better now than I have in a long time, and I feel like myself! I've been trying different medications on and off for the last 6 years, and to be honest it's been a complete rollercoaster. Vyvanse, adderall XR, mydayis, ritalin, concerta... they all just didn't work for me (it's so different for everyone!)

With this combination I find myself to be much less impulsive! I do still experience that burning ""gotta do it right now"" feeling, but I'm actually aware of it now and this awareness makes SUCH a difference. I actually allow myself to be expressive and do fun things, often enough that I don't feel deprived at all, which keeps me from getting myself into horrible, life threatening situations or ruining relationships, etc.","e5y4oie",2,1536897474,"2018-09-14 03:57:54"
"3939","""Hyperfocus"" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD.

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

"3943","Yep. I dunno what I wrote in my original post so I might repeat some things, but the idea of 8 hours is outdated and built on the false assumption that you’re working productively that entire time. Few people are. I read about a lot of people in Japan priding themselves on working more than the usual 40 hours a week, but it turns out that when they do overtime and go home late, their measured productivity isn’t any better than it is when working less and that it’s all just appearances. 

The 8 hour day was established when people actually did constant work, like working on an assembly line, and because that was the only option at the time given the newly established work culture and the low level of technology at the time. And fighting for a guaranteed 8 hours made sense at a time when they needed that work and were also in a position to easily be screwed over by their employers. Which also ties into the emphasis around the clock, which emerged because you wanted to be accurately compensated for your work, and because trains suddenly created a need for everything to be synchronized and running on time. 

We’re at a point now where a lot of work done in offices can be done in only a few hours or from home and at various times of the day. We can communicate instantly via our phones/computers. Telecommunications and working remotely shouldn’t be reserved for only the select few people who happen to be lucky enough and persuasive enough to leverage their results in such a way that they can convince their employers to grant them exceptional accommodations. You’re being paid to be physically present somewhere, to do things according to silly rules, under the outdated and false assumption that the company is getting the same results that they would otherwise. Even if you could prove that you can deliver the same results in less time, there’s a cultural aversion to paying you the same amount for less hours despite the same results because we are so used to emphasizing working hard versus working smart, and glorifying work for the sake of work. And for what reason? The person who works less but delivers better results is going to be valued more than the person who works longer/harder and delivers less results, but our culture simultaneously holds that belief with one that working longer/harder somehow makes you morally superior. It’s contradictory. 

And why is working long/hard so valued? Why do we work? We work so that we can survive and do what matters in life, such as spending time with our family. But with an 8 hour work day, there’s all sorts of other opportunity costs. There’s the time spent in traffic. There’s the mental/physical fatigue that keeps you from being too drained to fully utilize the hours that are supposed to be yours, hours that are meant to be used for self-improvement, exercising, enjoying life, spending time with your family, spending time with friends. After a long shift, a lot of us are barely able to do much more than eat junk food and watch TV. So we work so that we can afford shelter and food to keep us barely living just long enough to work some more the next day, over and over until it’s too late. And it’s all so silly because even if you wanted to be fully cynical and think in terms of the company’s interest in maximizing productivity, you could make a strong argument (and prove it, as has been done in some cases) that you’ll get way more productivity out of happier, more fulfilled employees who work at their own pace in ways that are best for them and who are able to get a lot of sleep, exercise, nutrition, and build new skills on their own time. A few companies do recognize this and shape their company culture accordingly, but most companies are still trapped in an outdated mindset.

"3988","Here is a major hack I figured out while in ADHD CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) — extremely worthwhile (if a little long) so please bear with me:

If trying to prioritize by importance or even just figuring out the best order is difficult - write down a list all your tasks and assign an estimated amount of TIME you believe each one will take. (Unless you have a time limit you do not need to worry about being perfect or even close on these estimates because, ya know, time blindness and ADHD.) 

Then - decide based on timing alone which to do first. Conventional wisdom says do the longest/hardest thing first. But sometimes I just say “okay I have 20 good minutes in me - which task is closest to 20 minutes?” And tackle that first. Then head on to the next one if you have it in you. 

Basically - remove your brain’s natural impulse to spin and spiral and dissect by eliminating any emotional weight or meaning to the tasks (I.e. deciding if you should start to research your essay now makes you think about your grades/dread/pressure NOPE let it instead become “45 minutes of my life” ... thinking about if you should make your bed vs. clean the kitchen becomes a psychological maze of whether cooking or sleeping is more important NOPE it becomes “15 minutes of my life” vs. “30 minutes of my life.”)

PRO TIPS: 
1) Always break down tasks into SMALL chunks wherever possible. “Clean my room” NOPE... that should read “make bed (5 min) fold laundry (20 min), vacuum (10 min)” - 3 separate DOABLE tasks each assigned a minute value. ... YES this will make your list LONG - however - you will get to cross off SO MUCH SHIT - and actually see how much progress you’re making!

2) Always use minutes not hours. I.e. “Write essay” should become “research sources (3 sessions of 45 minutes each), pull quotes from sources (4 sessions of 30 minutes each), write outline (2 sessions of 55 minutes each)...” etc. etc. 

3) NEVER give yourself any task lasting more than 55 minutes BREAK THAT SHIT DOWN - it will help I promise","ggr309y",1,1608686361,"2020-12-23 01:19:21"
"3989","I already use the built in iOS Notes app for bullet journaling. It already does everything I need to do. 

Every day I create a new note in my Journal folder with the title like `2018-12-10 Monday`. It gets three sections: Todo, Events, Notes. Todo is a checkbox list. Events is a dot list. Notes is a dash list. 

If I need to move a task, I note where it's been moved and update the appropriate file. 

`[ ] Update Resume =&gt; Future`

I don't bother with an index because I can just search my notes. I make sure that a task on a project includes the project name so I can find it later.

"4014","I stopped taking my meds about 2 years ago and have not looked back since. :)

One of the main reasons I stopped was that I had been reading and studying myself, to try and understand what I could do when I realized that I was spacing out or distracted or something along those lines. In my research, one of the main things I learned about was triggers and what I could do when I realized that I needed to get back on track... for me, it was taking a few minutes and really thinking about what I wanted to accomplish and figure out how I could do it. This has worked quite well for me. Another trick that I use is to allot a certain amount of time to complete whatever task I was working on at that time. 

Another reason I wanted to stop was my weight loss. I am a fairly thin dude and when my wife mentioned to me that I had lost some weight, I didn't think it was that big of a deal.. then I weighed myself and took a good look at myself in the mirror. I had lost more weight than I though and my face and body showed it. This I did not like either. 

I think another very important thing for me has been the realization and acceptance that I do have ADD/ADHD. Its not a bad thing, its not a good thing... its just a thing. Once I had this under control and knew what I could do when I was struggling, its like the fog stated to lift on its own. 

I would **highly** recommend the book, ""[Permission to Proceed](http://www.amazon.com/Permission-Proceed-David-Giwerc-ebook/dp/B005GXNFE4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397595278&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Permission+to+Proceed)"" ... hopefully it can help you or anyone who reads it, as much as it helped me.

"4015","You are a college student?  If so you can have a study partner, a tutor unconnected to your classes , a TA or professor that you visit during office hours.

Hell you can hire an ""coffee buddy"" where you buy them coffee three times a week and during the 15 minutes you two drink coffee you discuss your plans and what you need to do.  He gets the coffee for his time, and he provides emotional support.

You hire him via craigslist or the college message boards, bulletin boards, etc.

And it does not have to be you buying support, it could work as a trade as well.  Find another ADHD person or someone who would benefit and you just meet up 3 times a week and you help him or her, and vice versa.  It is simply a cooperative trade, tic for tac.

For this to work you do not have to consider them your friend or someone you love like a SO or a family member.  **All that is important for this to work is you consider them an ally.**  You have to trust them.  For example you may consider your doctor an ally, or your auto mechanic, but you have to trust them to accept their ""help"" and their ""social comments on what you should do"" even if you are paying them for this social service.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't go to my GP at first hahahahaaha. I literally just went straight to a neuropsychologist, called them up and cried about why I wanted an assessment. They told me to come in, I paid a buttload ($3000, I have no insurance) and I wasn't even questioned or felt interrogated ONCE. Did like 12 hours of psychological testing (including breaks) and here we are. Brought the diagnosis to my GP and all she asked me was what in my life would be helped with medication. She happily prescribed it to me with helpful advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel extremely lucky. I've heard so many similar stories to this that it just blows my mind. It's just beyond me to think you have to jump through that many hoops and to get a proper assessment in some places. Like just GIVE the assessment. You need to assess...you can't just magically tell it's something else. Heck, I found out I have a math learning disability from the assessment. Not like the NP could tell just by looking at me that I have a math learning disability \*eyeroll\*. It's the same with ADHD. She needed report cards, she needed to talk to family members, my boyfriend and THEN compare it to my own opinion, and then cross-examine them with my dramatically long test results. I'm no professional, so I can't really say what the process of assessment is like....but UGH.

&amp;#x200B;

"4040","I think this is my last post, not because I do not want to help but because I am afraid of rambling over overwhelming you :P

&gt;I'm a father of twin (boy/girl) 4.5 yr olds

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;This is almost compounded by contrasting his sisters behavior....she is a ""model"" type student who lives to follow rules. Any help or suggestions would be great!

ADHD very much exists in girls, and it is higher in fraternal twins (and even higher in identical twins).

But ADHD looks different in girls but it very much exists.

For example while both genders may find something really hard or they start daydreaming when the son is critique by his parent

* He lashes out he says I hate this, and becomes defiant, disobedient, picky, or just letting everyone know his displeasure even if in the end he will calm down or work with you during the tasks he finds fun.

* The daughter is more likely to internalize this trying harder to please the parent and be perfect while at the same time beating herself up and feeling bad.

* Or when a daughter finds something to be hard she is not afraid to ask for help from her parents or teachers.  All kids ask for help but this in turn means the daughters are diagnosed at a later age for they actually use support systems and the parents never think is my child having more problems than other girls her age?  And thus the parents never really provide the support system their daughter needs to thrive.

* Also the social things with girls is just far more complicated with girls.  Inattention to all this social reciprocity kills relationships with girls.  Boys with ADHD often have problems making friends for they are unpredictable and do not understand rules or boundaries and thus the other kids do not like them for they do not trust them or do not feel safe around them, or they are just too emotionally exhausting and not worth it.  Girls with ADHD on the other hand do not notice all the subtle things, thus they can internalize and act super shy, withdrawn, and just do not make friends for they do not know how, or they can just be oblivious and make mistakes that while not going to get the other kids to say I hate her like non ADHD boys say about ADHD boys, but instead more of the social shunning and not including that girls do to other girls.

Dr. Patricia Quinn is one of the leading adhd explainers/experts on how ADHD occurs in girls.  [Here is some books on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Patricia-O.-Quinn/e/B001JRXPX2/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?qid=1429702289&amp;sr=1-2) she also specializes on how ADHD is different at different ages from preschool, elementary, high school, and college and how you need to do transition planning for each of those ages in the kid's life for the kid has unique challenges at each age but also like all kids the personality and the abilities of ADHD kids change when they mature and become more like adults and finally adults.

[Dr Patricia Quinn also did a great free lecture on ADHD and Girls avaliable here](http://learningcenter.unc.edu/ldadhd-services/burnett-seminars/dr-patricia-quinn/).  It was the 2011 Burnett lecture (which is a good ADHD yearly talk with many great experts).

"4042","Yeah, I think small goals are a good idea. Do you think maybe it feels like a big thing to actually start cutting wood because that's when mistakes happen. I've got a dovetailed box I'm about half way through that I started over a year ago. There's nothing to it that I haven't done before, but it's a present for a family member so in my mind it has to be 100% perfect, so I have to get myself 'in the zone' before I can work on it.

Maybe it's a case of not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. Could you try doing something not to big, but aiming to just do it, accepting that it likely won't be perfect and that there will be mistakes, but that's ok.

The other thing I find is that sometimes I have to break down the task of getting started into small steps. Because it's not clear exactly how I get everything set up to begin, I feel blocked from starting. I tend to find that my procrastination is often due to me not having broken down the task enough for me to know the first step in getting started.","guy5m8z",1,1618732201,"2021-04-18 07:50:01"

I am currently on wellbutrin NDRI and strattera NRI, when I went on wellbutrin my doctor took me off cymbalta which is a SNRI.  Notice all three Ns, you can get too much N just like you can get too much S when you take too many antidepressants that have synergistic effects and work on Serotonin.  I could have been just fine on all three medicines, but my current psych is very prudent and *conservative.*

&amp;nbsp;

----

&amp;nbsp;

I originally went to my current psych because I lost my job, and I had a history of depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.  Since I lost my job I felt I was not as bad as I been in the past but I was aware I was declining and was afraid of a major relapse in some very dark shit.  He was my second adult therapist I saw, and I saw like two as a kid (due to some shit not connected to my behavior but the behaviors of other people which affected me as a kid).  The ones I saw as a kid were useless.  The first one I saw as an adult taught me some meditation and cbt and it was useless when I was 20 to 22.  Now at 28 it is kinda useful.  On the second visit my current psych figured out I was adhd, though that week I also had a kinda clue that just was a trigger.

On cymbalta combined with strattera (which I was prescribed after my second visit). I was kinda a stupid happy.  I mean stupid happy, nothing could not get the smile off my face, I was the Joker who was having the time of his life for he was chasing after Batman.  Strattera dramatically helped my energy level, but my working memory and some other adhd symptoms were just as bad as ever, thus he put me on wellbutrin.  We got the strattera level where it should be currently, we are still messing with the wellbutrin for the working memory.

My current psych (which is conservative) does not want to try stimulants except until we are finished with the non stimulant meds for my high pulse and history of panic attacks.  He is making the right call and I agree with him, but I hate how long the non stimulants to take in effect and how it is harder to get the dose right because it takes longer to see how you respond to the drug.

I am doing good right now, not stupid happy, but still joyful.","cjekgkv",4,1406946697,"2014-08-02 02:31:37"

Mornings I like to wake up so I have enough time to workout, shower, eat( but wouldn’t usually- most days was workout&amp;shower or shower&amp;eat). After work I spend some time washing my face etc. and then I’d do the usual chores (cook, wash dishes, clean, etc) and then while eating dinner I’d watch some tv. If it was a more stressful day and I didn’t have plans with friends I’d normally do the same as you and play video games or read. Otherwise I try to make plans with friends (only thing that can beat my adhd is my social anxiety/fear of letting others down!) to do something, anything. Or, if I was in the process of trying to take an mooc or teach myself something, I’d go to the public library. 

If you’re in a situation where you don’t know anyone well enough to schedule things with, I’d suggest buying tickets or to events that have starting times close enough to when you get home so that you don’t have enough time to do more than change/eat before hand. If you don’t have the time to get settled in, you’re less likely to do so and talk yourself out of going out.

"4119","This sounds like a lot more is going on than just ADHD to me. This person needs a psych evaluation ASAP. ADHD is known to be comorbid with a ton of other disorders, autism, OCD, anxiety (often in the form of hoarding, and no self care), depression, dyslexia, apashia,  migraines... Any nuerobiological issues, really, are more likely to happen with ADHD. 
 There could also be something traumatic behind this lifestyle, sexual abuse as a child maybe, physical abuse...  Therapy should be expected. Anger Management, and definitely medication for treatment. 

This is just my opinion based on my personal experience of course.. but I have had very severe untreated ADHD my whole life, emotional dysregulation is the only symptom I can't seem to stomp out of myself... it comes with rage, among other things... However, I don't physically abuse my partner, or my kids, and I don't ever say cruel or racist things to my friends and family of color. This is so much deeper than emotional dysregulation and executive functioning. This is a lifetime of self hatred, and what sounds like, hatred of others. They need help you aren't qualified to give.

Is your mom or that teacher a doctor?  I ask because they said that you didn't have ADHD, so I assume they must be, right?  Or, maybe you think the education and experience of a doctor means little.  In that case, why are you bothering to go to school to become an engineer?  Just, you know, give your layman's opinion, it's just as good.

Since you don't want to talk to a doctor, you should probably begin making plans for what you'll do once you flunk out, since it sounds like you're going to.  If you do nothing differently, nothing is going to change.

More kindly, I'll say that once of the most important reasons I make sure to treat my ADHD (meds are only one part of treatment) is for the people I care about.  Treatment makes me more aware of the people around me.  School reasons might not be enough for you to talk to a doctor, but maybe girlfriend reasons are.

The times I've relied too much on meds, I've begun to lose those skills, which are useful whether you take meds or not. I'm probably getting off-topic here. What was my point? Oh, I think it was: on XR, I felt like I was stuck in more of a regimen. Like, I had to take it in the morning every day whether I would end up needing it that day or not.

Also with IR, I can bite off pieces. Some days I just don't feel like I need a full dose. So I'll bite off half or a quarter. &lt;aside&gt;Depending on the manufacturer, it tastes like candy. Which seems weird to me. Like this is not something you'd want to taste like candy. Unless they're thinking specifically of people like me who bite them apart.

"4139","I can surely relate to this!

I have had exactly the same problem as long as I can remember. At least starting from my teen years.

The way you described the roles tells very familiar story of how I experience many every day social situations. I need structure and roles. Situations that lack them (or are unstructured enough that at least I can’t understand roles or structures) are a hell.

I might be interacting with others a minute earlier in a work context, but when we take a break I can be very aloof and unable to participate in a positive way with the exact same people.

This only gets harder while I get older.

I do find a difference though. I can do well online in one on one conversation even when I need to establish my role and structures in my own. (Not always tho).

For some years I tried not to care, but after diagnosis and medication I noticed how much good social connections and support could do. I started to benefit more from teamwork. I started to want to improve my game on this domain. So far I have had no success. 

---

Like you there are no ASD markers that would hint that to be in the mix.

I have been reading that  the poor working memory would make social pattern matching slower and harder. I have also described my ADHD saying that my subconscious leaks in to my consciousness. I feel that there are a ton of thoughts that are not filtered away like they should be. That might be case also for evaluating and choosing what actions are proper enough and which to choose.

Good old problems with prioritization. I also feel that my ability to evaluate success in social domain is pretty bad as well.

Another way I have been thinking this is that I become too self aware of my self and my (some times contradicting) motives in social situations. I have hard time deciding how to behave and what I really want.","f3cpkgy",1,1570826746,"2019-10-11 20:45:46"

"4160","I'm 22, about 150lbs and on my fourth day of vyvanse/elvanse/lisdexamphetamine. My doc started me on 30mg but I kind of wish he started me on lower.

It has been an absolute roller coaster, Saturday morning I was at work when I first took it, bad idea.
Euphoric like drug feeling for a few hours then feeling the comedown.
The day after I was okay but a little anxious, anxiety improved with food.
Yesterday I was an anxious mess for most of the day but again, eating helped.
Today has been brilliant, except from come 5pm and the crash hit, had to stop everything I was doing and sit down for an hour and a half. Awful crash, nausea, breathlessness, body aches and dizziness.
It's an hour and a half later from sitting down and I'm almost back to 100%.

I've been given both 30mg and 50mg for when I'm ready to try the 50mg. Given today I probably will put off upping my dose as despite today has been the best day on it, the crash put my whole being out of action and it's made me cautious of building up my mental tolerance to the drug for a long time first.

Also, the amount you are prescribed can depend on what type of ADHD you have. My psychiatrist said that therapy probably wouldn't help me as I struggle with medium focus the most and that kind of thing is best treated with drugs, hence the immediate 30mg. So although I wish he started me on lower, it's probably for the best.

Whether I move to 50mg will depend on the next few days and negating any other negative side effects I have, If the crash becomes easier then I will probably move up.

Salad is great because it's only 2 dishes! Of course, it can be maintenance to keep in stock esp if you don't grocery shop much (I don't, I usually just try to make 3 meals out of my carry-out meal) but when I do go shopping I always get me a bag of salad because I know I can just dump it all in a bowl, mix it up with some dressing, and enjoy.

I enjoy salad. It's a true equilibrium for me. It's good. It's not great. But it's good enough to sincerely enjoy given the fact that it's a healthy choice. It's like ""yeah, this is what I expect a healthy choice to be like. Kind of a content 'meh.'"" 

I'm sorry if this was already previously stated. I didn't read any of the other comments in this thread because, as you know, I have ADHD and have spent too much time as it is crafting the salad equilibrium statement and need to go to sleep.

"4222","In my case, I think my wife is just tired of hearing me say that I'm working on things, and then the following year being in the same exact spot. Even though I was undiagnosed then, years of that have eroded trust, patience and expectations of what I am capable to do. So obviously, her level of trust in things having a significant change over the long run is a bit shaky. Again, I don't blame her for that at all.   

A lot of that is why I am rather focusing on process instead of goals...focusing on repeatable steps, techniques and habits, so that I can at least bring myself to a baseline where I can function with a semblance of normalcy (even though I know it would never be in a traditional form).

Small sample:

* Do some programming, this can be either studying for real or just sketching on some random project that will probably never be finished but are fun nonetheless.
* Do the dishes, wash my clothes, cook extra food for tomorrow/the freezer, brush my teeth, take a shower. When you're bored out of your mind, even tasks that are normally boring fill the time for a short while, might as well take the time to do them.
* Stepmania is a nice game that can be played in short bursts, and more importantly, you can really see how you progress as you play more.
* As others have said, books, read em or listen to em, either way this gets its own sublist for all the books I'm interested in.
* Same goes for all content I consume that I'm interested in, I have a bookmarks folder called ""content"" which currently contains at least two pages worth of anime, series, movies, stories, comics and so on, just add to it everytime you find anything interesting.

"4237","Hey there Bakuryu,

Relax. Breathe.
It is VERY difficult to get work done during holidays. If you think about it, holidays are designated breaks from everyday life. As people needing structure and discipline to thrive, holidays are antithetical to ADHD. Schools and jobs give us normal schedules, so when we don't have those schedules, we flounder. So, it's ok to feel lost and unproductive. It's normal. Next time, **plan** to be as unproductive as possible. That way, you won't have to worry about looming deadlines and won't have the anxiety from feeling like you should be doing something.

This leads to needing to be proactive and plan ahead. If you can create a daily plan for yourself, either the nite before or in advance—in anticipation for holidays—then you will know what's required of you that day, giving you the chance to relax, and not be anxious, once you finish your day. Aim for 4 hours of productivity everyday.

Getting degrees, for some people, is easy. School, for some people, is easy. The problem is that higher education doesn't necessarily translate to real-world skills that will payoff. You need to build real skills in order to get paid. You're getting a degree in CS, which means you should be able to code. So, find jobs where they pay you to code or work on projects to use as part of your portfolio for when you want a job. Working on your craft is never a waste of time. But, don't lean on school and degrees to feed you because they won't. (I say this as I finish up my PhD).

In terms of feeling like you won't get things done in the future, it sounds like imposter syndrome—where you worry that you're not good enough and that people will figure it out. If that's the case, stop feeling that way. You have to feel proud of yourself, you have to trust that you are in control of your destiny. No one can predict the future, especially not the disasters, so don't try. 

Just take things a day at a time. Schedule things out in manageable, 15 minutes chunks. Study yourself to learn your habits, and then leverage them to be the best **you** you can be.

**TL;DR: No on is productive during holidays—what'd be the point? Plan your life out: 4 hours of daily productivity, broken down into 15 minute chunks. Structure = no anxiety. To quote the Talking Heads, “The future is certain”--as in, it will come--so give yourself “time to work it out.” Road to Nowhere: live it, love it.**","cn7hdux",1,1419788386,"2014-12-28 17:39:46"

Whether you are a high school drop out burger flipper with no further career prospects or a Wall Street executive with an Ivy League education, your diagnosis will not depend on how sucessful you are or your educational history.

What we have really is *disorder*. Things are messy, out of place, not working right, chaotic, non-sequitor, etc. We live in a state of disorder, really. So we **have**, as in carry around with us, a disorder.

I wouldn't be scared of medication. It has helped me a **lot**, as well as many others here. It can be super effective once you find one that agrees well with you, but it's not magic and it may take time to find the right dosage and type of medication. I've been without my prescription for about two weeks now, but after being medicated for about half a year and starting to see my own ADHD-fueled shortcomings, even being non-medicated I can use management strategies to still get things done. I just have to be alert and mindful.

It can all feel overwhelming, but also very relieving when you first get diagnosed! You are not sub-par, you just have unique obstacles that other people don't have. With determination, self-forgiveness, and medication (if you choose) you can be very happy and successful with ADHD. It's really hard sometimes, but it's very doable.

I'm also mega skinny, but being aware of some of the appetite-suppressing side-effects of stimulant medications helps me to remember to eat regularly (which I have always struggled with, as well as sleeping regularly). If you maintain open communication with your physician (which you have already, it sounds like) they will definitely help you find success in this, whether medicated or not.","d9be2is",1,1477662372,"2016-10-28 13:46:12"

"4277","""Just go out and get a job you enjoy"" is completely useless advice. Do you think people who don't enjoy their jobs aren't fucking trying to get better ones? ADHD makes ""40 hours"" (more, considering the time it takes to get ready and commute which are necessary parts of work.) a week tough enough without having to put several more hours a week into resumes, applications, and interviews. Not to even *mention* various fiscal, familial, geographical, etc... Reasons why a person might not be able to switch jobs.

Sorry if I'm a bit heated but it's ""advice"" that comes around too often and is always underthought, but especially here in an ADHD fourum. You might as well just be saying ""deal with the ADHD itself first,"" because it feels, to me at least, like a necessary step in finding a better job.","echyf4t",2,1545707148,"2018-12-25 03:05:48"

"4280","Was thinking the same thing. We hold ourselves up to people's best and think we are failures to not be that way 100% of the time. Comparing yourself to another person will always end up in failure, especially when we don't know how they got where they are. People struggle, people fail, the strong ones are the ones who get back up. The people that succeed are the ones who fail the most. Success also doesn't mean fame, fortune, and glory. It could mean posting that artwork online for people, publishing a book after years a fear, saying hello to that person you see every day  at school/work that you've never had the courage to walk up to. Your success is yours and also cannot be compared. Success to someone who is given everything is getting something worth more money or power. Success for me is sitting and writing for my book for a little while, I have not set time or amount of words but if I write some then it's a small victory because I didn't give up. 

It helps for me to give this type of advice because I struggle with remembering it myself. We are only human after all.","f6w5tp7",1,1573217432,"2019-11-08 12:50:32"

"4283","Right, so that's why I said to make it a priority. Treat it like you would any other task. Research what successful people do and how. Read books that give insight, and most importantly, seek out people who are extremely well liked AND successful in their careers. There is a ton of information on the subject out there and frankly, you may not have been as well liked as you thought off the meds either, you just are now picking up on social cues that you may not have noticed prior because you weren't paying attention. Then picking up on those cues sabotages you, because the ADHD you probably didn't catch the dirty look even though they thought you did, and you still walked up talking your normal confident self and told a joke as if nothing had ever happened or you didn't give a shit what they thought. This made you look confident, when in reality, you just genuinely didn't notice they were trying to be assholes.","dc3vie5",1,1483763743,"2017-01-07 04:35:43"

[Friend] was standing over there, but mostly paying attention to [something else], while I was sitting at my desk.  [TV Show] was on, it was the episode where [something happens].  Right when [character] [does something], I responded to you with [what I said].  That seemed to evoke [emotional response] in you, and [friend] just laughed.  It was [time of day], and my curtains were [opened or closed].

So, moral of the story is to have a good, honest talk with your doctor about symptoms and worries. It may take time to find the dosage and med/med combo that works for you. Keep notes on how you feel, so you can report back to the doc.

After a couple of weeks the side effects should be less pronounced and you may go back to your normal routines.   Tea may be a better option as it has less caffeine. I feel much more sensitive to caffein so a very light coffee or a black tea should be enough to give you the kick start u might need sometimes.   Dry mouth or increased thirst is also normal.

I used to lie a lot to get myself/keep myself out of trouble. Sometimes, I'd lie out of boredom (like little kids do--telling stories about your day that didn't actually happen).  


I also used to hate myself, and felt like every good thing I had was just a fluke, and that I had neither earned nor deserved any of it. Being a chronic bullshitter really damaged my trust and faith *in myself.*   


I started telling the truth and actually *apologizing* and taking *responsibility* for my screw ups. Taking ownership of those flaws feels a lot better than you'd think, and that little endorphin burst of ""I DID THE RIGHT THING!"" has really helped motivate me to be a consistently more honest individual.   


I want to be perceived as trustworthy, and for a long time felt like I was hardwired to be anything but. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy helped me work through the reflexive (and untrue) fear that if I were totally honest with people, they'd hate me. On the contrary, I find myself a lot easier to love since I've started really *practicing* honesty.

&gt;Lee was diagnosed ADHD prior to entering medical school and it may have explained Lee's poor grades in undergraduate classes even though Lee is smart, loves the body and helping people and generally gets the concept of medicine even if he is bad with the details.  Lee exercises every day a combination of swimming  and light weightlifting.  Since being diagnosed with ADHD Lee has tried two different adhd medications and while it helps with his studying and staying on task. Lee feels like medicated him is somehow inauthentic like it is not really him learning those anatomy facts and how the body is complicated and how one aspeft of one system effects another bodily system.

&gt;Lee is a senior and has one more year of premed at the university level before taking the next step of his medical training.  Lee knows he is ADHD but he feels the need to stop all medication to prove to himself that he is capable and the works of his body and mind are really him and not some lie that he tells to himself and the meds help pertipuate.

&gt;Lee's doctor states that finding the right ADHD medication for Lee is trial and error.  How the ADHD meds work are not all the same , for example there are stimulant meds and non stimulant meds for ADHD.  Concerta is one form of stimulant and how it works on a biological level is different than Adderall and Vyvanse even though both are stimulants, thus some people do better on Concerta while others on adderall.  Other medications for ADHD work differently, the doctor says there are non stimulants for ADHD like Strattera and Intuniv but Lee's doctor never explains how stimulants or non stimulants are different or how Strattera has more in common with Concerta a form of Methyphendiate than Intuniv even though both Intuniv and Strattera are non stimulants yet Strattera works more similar to Concerta than Intuniv.  Lee's doctor goes on some non ADHD meds also sometimes help ADHD like meds for daytime sleppiness, (Modafinil) or meds for fighting seasonal depression (buproprion) .  Finding the right med is trial and error but part of Lee doubt's his doctor he tried an SSRI in the past for depression and that med did not work so why should other meds work any different.  Especially when some of these off label ADHD meds for other disorders yet used to treat ADHD are called antidepressants, such as buproprion.  Now Lee's doctor says buproprion is an atypical antidepressant and it works differently than an SSRI like Lexapro but Lee's doctor does not explain what he means by atypical or how it is different.  Part of Lee is just tired of medicine in general.

&gt;Lee's doctor goes on and says ADHD brings emotional baggage that is not technically ADHD but comes along with it, such as feelings of worthiness, inauthenticity, restlessness, and questioning the purpose of things.  Lee's doctor says meds may help these feelings, this emotional baggage on the margins, but overall these feelings are not caused by ADHD but instead interacting with the world and thus non med techniques such as talking to someone helps you process and understand those feelings and come to terms with what is an emotional fear and what is truly part of you or reality.  He recommends talking to a therapist or something called an ADHD coach, a person who understands ADHD issues and helps you view the world from a different perspective and helps you organize your life by helping you categorize problems with different terms that it is easier to process and tackle.

&gt;Yet Lee wonders if his doctor advice of a coach or therapist will really help or is it a lie to make him feel better.  Lee does not really know what to believe.

Did seeing this similar scenario from a different light help you process or understand ADHD?

We have over 7 different classes of meds for ADHD.  Vyvanse and adderall belong to the same class of medication.  Concerta belongs to the second class, Strattera to a third, Intuniv to a fourth.  The fifth, sixth, and seventh classes of meds are technically for other disorders but they can help ADHD.  Lexapro an SSRI is not an ADHD med at all yet ADHD can occur in a person with emotional processing issues and the SSRIs help with other things such as emotional issues, depression, anxiety, and feeling out of place.  Having more than one issue but these issues being separate is called coexisting disorders or commorbidity.  80% of ADHD people have a second disorder completely unconnected to ADHD, depression is one such thing.  Many of these commorbidities are emotional but biological, while others are more of the emotional baggage of untreated ADHD.

ADHD meds is one part of the picture for ADHD but non med therapies are just as important for they treat ADHD in different ways and they augment each other when used in combination.  An ADHD coach of a CBT specialist a type of therapy that is used for ADHD but also depression and anxiety is one of the most effective adjuncts to medication.  A CBT coach helps you untangle thoughts, behaviors, perception,a and feelings for A). Thoughts create feelings B) Feelings generate Behaviors C) Behaviors enhance and reinforce thoughts and thus A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;A and again and again.  By slowing down and breaking difficult but fast moving things into chunks and tackling the chunks one at a time it is much easier to escape the negative cycle.  Once out of the negative cycle you do the opposite and start doing proactive behaviors, proactive feelings and emotions, which leads to proactive thoughts which leads to a reapprasial of the situations and events you interact with on a daily level.

I do have a job, and I’m one of the best employees, but it’s only cause I’m in a job where I’m around my interests (aviation), but if I had a job I didn’t like I’d be a terrible employee and I’d get fired pretty quick cause I couldnt handle it.  My job has become my identity and I don’t know what I’d do if I lost it cause my life kinda depends on it.  

I got diagnosed ADHD very recently and am just starting meds.  First one I tried I had terrible side effects, and haven’t started the other yet cause it’s expensive as hell (cause ‘Murica!) , and I’ll have to sign up for a program to make it a lot cheaper and I haven’t done that yet cause I’m a procrastinator. 

I don’t have much hope that the meds are really going to be life changing for me.  I have a feeling every one of them will have an intolerable side effect or just won’t work well enough.  

I hope I’m wrong.  Hearing it work for others gives me some hope.  But I’m 27, and currently getting help has been so stressful to me because now I feel like I have standards to abide by where as I didn’t before cause I just didn’t care about where my life went anymore. 

All my life I’ve been winging it cause I didn’t know how else to live.  I’m too dumb for anything other than the simple job I’m doing now.  I’m only still “making it” cause things just happen to fall in my lap, but once that stops then I dunno.  

If the meds don’t help I’ll likely die by suicide.  Maybe a long time from now but I just feel that’s how it’ll be.","fz8zvib",2,1595719409,"2020-07-25 23:23:29"

"4355","Routine is most important, but the advice for NTs can help us here. 

1. Bed is for sleeping ONLY. No reading, work, or TV in bed. 

2. NO lights. You want it as close to pitch black as possible. 

3. An hour before you want to sleep, turn down lights. Make rooms dim. Make screens dim. Try to avoid TV

Some additional stuff that works for me:

1. Play music with lyrics that you can sing by heart. Be smart, stay away from heavy stuff that amps you up. Keep the volume low and focus on the lyrics. This REALLY helps with racing thoughts at night, as your brain can focus on the lyrics, but it doesn't really require any mental effort to think lyrics you've memorized. 

2. I use benadryl for about two nights to try and set my sleep schedule if it gets out of whack. Take an hour before bed, and do the first three things. This can be enough to set sleep schedule. 

3. Wake up. Early. Like exactly 8 hours after you intend to fall asleep. Get out of bed as soon as you wake. Go pee, and sit on the toilet in full light to wake up if you need to. Get a morning routine and do this every time you wake up. This also helps with that ""i can't get out of bed"" feeling. Personally, mine is to go straight to pee, sit on the toilet for 10 minutes on reddit, take my meds on the toilet, brush my teeth. Then DON'T GO BACK TO BED. 

4. I use Bixby routines. Every night at 8, my phone turns my ringer off, brightness to min, and blue light filter on. At 5, brightness is maxed, filter off, ringer on. It helps. I think all phones have something similar. 

5. Believe you can fall asleep. Nothing ironic and annoying like thoughts of ""im not gonna be able to sleep"" or ""Why can't i sleep"" while your trying to.

"4380","Regarding your question about why your parents didn't know you were ADHD as a child: I am a 45 year old mother of 3 daughters. When my girls were younger I never thought any of them could ever be ADHD. There was a stigma attached to ADHD kids: they had lazy parents who never disciplined them and just wanted to pop them on meds so they wouldn't have to deal with them, blah blah blah. My youngest daughter always got good grades, wasn't hyper and only got in trouble at school for talking. LOTS of talking. Excessive talking. Never did I think she might be ADD. When she was 14 she asked me to have her tested. I was shocked. She explained her symptoms and her research to me, provided me with information and requested to see a doctor. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sat in the room with her during her testing and frankly was floored by the fact that she hit almost every item on that test...but SO DID I. It was an ""a ha moment"" for me. Not only did my kid have ADD, but I did as well. I made my own testing appointment and we both were diagnosed and started on the meds. I was a little embarrassed to let people know that we were ADD, that old stigma coming back to haunt me. Did I fail her as a parent? Did I baby her too much since she was my last ""baby""? Was I being hypochondriac myself? The doubts and anxiety alone caused me many many hours of hyper focus and guilt. 

&amp;#x200B;

But we started the meds, which had to be tweaked a bit, and life became much more manageable for us both. Not perfect, but manageable. I never knew how well I could manage things until I started on those meds. I am thankful we got her diagnosed and medicated much earlier in her life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I am a pro at rambling so I'll wrap it up: I'm not sure why your parents didn't catch on that you had ADHD as a child, maybe from lack of knowledge, maybe from misconceptions, maybe from the whole stigma thing, who knows. But your feelings are valid, even the anger, and with time and the right medication I think you'll start to feel more accustomed and better able to handle things in life. Hopefully you can gain some peace and work through any anger you feel towards them, it's natural and acceptable and I think it can be overcome. Best of luck to you and sending positivity your way!

"4383","Not being 'normal' is honestly something he'll have to come to terms with on his own. I struggled with it for nearly a year after I was diagnosed in 4th grade. Nothing that my mother said helped. It was really just time that helped with it. What I eventually came to realize was that it didn't matter whether I was normal or not. It didn't matter how much of my personality was me and how much was the disorder. What did matter was that I mattered. I existed, for better or for worse, and existing was something I really enjoyed. What mattered was that I had a problem that I needed to fix. That revelation hit me around 5/6th grade,  and ever since I've been fine with having ADHD, if a bit frustrated at times.

I also had big bouts of anger, and occasionally still do. The only thing that helped them was time and maturing. Eventually I learned that people didn't like me when I was mean. Let him face the social consequences of his actions. Much like people with Autism, people with ADHD are pretty socially incapable. We learn proper social behaviors from negative feedback. You can tell him "" Don't shoot people with nerf guns"" all you like, but he's not going to stop until something *makes* him stop, like having a sibling hit him or losing a friend because of it.

The other thing I want to mention with the bouts of anger is that a lot of mine were because of over-stimulation. I still remember wearing this shirt that had a tag that rubbed me. It was so itchy and I couldn't fix it and it was driving me absolutely *insane*, and my mother turned to me and asked an innocent question and I blew up on her like a super volcano. I would also have them when too many people were around, or I was cramped and crowded, when my social meter was empy, when I was hungry, when I was emotional and my parents wouldn't let me retreat and calm down. I still snap at people to this very day, at age 20, when I get overwhelmed. Many people with ADHD have sensory issues. We share a lot of similarities with autism - for instance, when I'm upset, I rapidly tap the side of my face with my palm, and I have difficulty with eye contact in general. I would really encourage you to look at what's going on around him when he has his anger outbursts. There may be things triggering him that you can remove. Oh, also, make sure everything is very organized and clean! I become more overwhelmed and temperamental when things aren't organized and clean. Also make sure his blood sugar is up! He needs a steady, constant amount of glucose in his brain. I like to sip on sweet tea or Gatorade slowly throughout the day.

Really, there's not much you can *say* to him that will help him. He needs action and change. But one thing I can tell you is that he *needs* friends his own age with ADHD. When I got to middle school, I met my two best friends, and quickly found out that they also had ADHD (and had been diagnosed earlier than me). It was like heaven. I finally felt normal, I finally found a place where I belonged. I had people who knew what I was going through. I could look at them and say ""I'm having such a hard time with X"" and they would look back and say ""I know exactly what you mean"". He needs *peers*. He needs you to stop sheltering him (although I agree with your nerf gun call in theory, telling him that he can't have something *because* of his ADHD is a **literal RECIPE** for self hatred and loathing) and he needs to be able to be himself. To face social backlash when he screws up and have friends that understand his problems. Being medicated will help a lot, because his brain will finally start being more like everyone else's. I would get him the nerf gun if it goes well when he's stable on medication. Medication really is life changing, I *promise* you. Everything will be better then. He'll be happier, you'll be happier. He'll stop feeling like a screw up all the time, stop feeling like he's disappointing you, stop feeling like he's a burden. The future is bright for him.","daynaie",3,1481240427,"2016-12-08 23:40:27"

If you're looking for a simple answer, your brain isn't wired correctly. 

A slightly more sophisticated answer would be that the dopamine and norepinephrine transmitters don't function properly, which means that your focus, drive, motivation, and emotions aren't properly regulated. 

To get an exact answer you're going to need to talk to whoever diagnosed you and ask them why they concluded that, or, and I don't recommend this, consult the DSM V and see what symptoms listed line up with what you're experiencing. That's not recommended because then you venture into self diagnosis and bias territory.

I got it as I was worried I had Bipolar but my doctor and I put it down to environmental issues triggering me and I also think my medication rebounds when wearing off don’t help.

Anyway in a nutshell this is how it work;

You click on your current mood and also use hash tags, on anything important.

For instance you might write “Today I spoke with #MarkFromWork who told blah blah blah”. Then what you do is you go to your history and look at your entries and provided you put tidbits of important information it can help. If you are very busy or forgetful (I’ve also been in these situations) you can use a “Voice Recorder”. Make notes about things you think you may forget.

I understand your frustrations and I have allot of medical issues at the moment so it’s become harder but use technology to your advantage! Also use a passcode on the chosen app or your phone at the least.

I would say that sounds like you were on too high a dosage, a licensed medical professional ( hopefully a psychiatrist) should be able to help you get the correct dosage. 

When I started taking meds my psychiatrist started me on an extremely small dosage for a week or so, and then slowly worked up to what I take now. It was all about finding the dosage that gave me the most positive effects of the medication and the least of the negative side effects. 

I experienced some appetite suppression  (has mostly faded now), which was actually helpful because I was prone to compulsive/impulsive eating as a result of my ADHD. But basically no other side effects, in fact I have slept better in my years on medication then I ever did before. 

I think the most important thing is to know that there should be a huge difference between taking a self prescribed dose of Adderal vs. working with your psychiatrist and using medication as a treatment.

Before I took medication, I think it wasn’t as obvious but I 100% was doing shit with my life and couldn’t focus enough to read a paragraph in a textbook so I don’t think it’s bad enough to stop, but with reading your comment on top of being more self-aware, I think it’s kinda like having different super powers.

Super social me is good as networking and building friendships. Super calm me is good at making decisions I know I can trust later. Super anxious me is good at helping me decide and remember what needs to get done and how I can see myself improving. Being that alien where everyone feels so different, well, that just kind of gives you a break to sit back and watch.

"4454","I'm not medicated (yet) but that definitely sounds more like habit/fidget/compulsive behavior (which can be exacerbated by stimulants for some) rather than self harming behavior. I compulsively pick at my lips (to the point where they bleed and I still keep going) and I've also struggled with self harm &amp; they are completely separate behaviors from me, coming from a completely different mental state. Self harm involves actually wanting to cause harm to yourself, not just having a habit or compulsive behavior that happens to result in harm. 

Have you tried having something to fiddle with when you're bored? Having something else to do with your hands instead of picking at your skin can really help. The fidget spinner is obviously very famous but there's a lot of fidget toys out there that are less conspicuous. Even having a hairtie around your wrist or a ring to fiddle with, or nail polish to pick at rather than picking at your fingers can be really helpful.","dx3islj",1,1523315680,"2018-04-09 23:14:40"

The go to method for anyone with ADHD is to:
organize your work space
turn off your phone
make a detailed checklist
take the medicine (optional if you feel like it doesn’t help)
immediately immerse yourself in the work
-work for 25 minutes take a short 2-3 minute break and when the hour mark goes by take a 5 minute break. Repeat this until you finish the task at hand.

"4473","I have a friend who was really, really good friends with someone for eleven years. They were as close as you described you are with your friend—they were joined at the hip, always talking, hanging out whenever they could. This friend of my friend would constantly tell my friend that she was making up her problems, that she could just change them herself one day if she just decided to, that she created her problems herself. My friend grew up constantly believing that she was inherently a problem, because of how this friend of hers treated her mental health. They went through the same cycle of arguing until my friend would apologize, and then continue on until the next argument. Never once was my friend’s friend the one who apologized. A year ago, my friend was diagnosed with autism, and finally started to realize the reality of her mental issues. These two only lasted as long as my friend was willing to allow herself to be manipulated by her friend, and after a year of them living together as roommates, she finally took a stand. Because she decided to come into herself and stand up for herself and stop being the one to apologize and try to change—her friend pushed back. So they split. It was incredibly painful and involved a lot of drama from both her ex-friend and this girl’s current (and verbally abusive) boyfriend, who was also living with them. She’s still not recovered entirely from the abuse she dealt with during that eleven years, and she still struggles with regret that she didn’t cut her friend off years ago. So, consider your options, like the previous user said, it’s never as awkward as you might think. People grow out of each other—it’s natural. You’ll meet new people who are more like you as you go through life, and you’ll meet people who will come to mean more to you than you ever thought people could mean to you. Especially if it means prioritizing your mental health—leave someone who won’t support you. You should never give your time to someone who doesn’t believe the best of you.","fdp2b08",1,1578618310,"2020-01-10 01:05:10"

"4478","If you stop drinking, you are leaving something that has become habit.  You are going to need to replace the 'drinking thinking' and get to AA, sooner rather than later.  There isn't any substitute.  If I hadn't done AA, I'd never have made it.

Keep in mind that I wasn't a quick study.  You sound like you could be better than I was because you are asking the right questions.  Please do better than I did.  I suffered years longer than I needed to, and how I wish I had those years back.

AA gives the tools to help.  I can now be at a wedding (I do freelance photography) and ignore the wine I adored, move the bottles for a better pic, but it took time.  Meetings.  Meeting makers make it.

This never happens overnight.  It took me 18 months to walk down the dairy aisle at Walmart because the other side is all alcohol.  But then it was OK.  Now I just feel meh.  Every so often a stray thought drifts in, but it passes like smoke.  My real problem is cigarettes and potato chips.  LOL  

As for your work, I don't know what to say.  I couldn't do that if it were in my face every day.  I'd be either getting the hell out of there and work at McDonalds.  I have no idea what to say on this one.

We don't think in terms of 'forever.'  That's a complete recipe for failure.  I don't get up in the morning and say, ""I can never drink again!  Can't go to Spain where I first had that gorgeous glass of wine and arrgghhh!""  Instead I say, ""Today I don't have to drink.  Just today.""  And if I'm stressing, I rely on the tools I've learned from meetings, I can call an AA contact, hit a meeting, do some reading or meditating, whatever.  I can't do it on my own -- ever.  

There is no number of days, so 'finishing line' of sobriety, no forever.  For me, it's today.  I'm 4 years, 10 months, 6 days, and about 10 hours of sober.  That's as forever as it gets -- today.

This is all hard-line stuff here, I know.  Just telling you what I've seen.  I walked into my first AA meeting 25 years ago.  It took 20 years before I figured it all out.  Multiple rehabs, waking up in psych wards, two DUI's, a car crash and a surgically repaired arm, career crash, etc. etc.  I'm a slow learner.  Don't be like me.  I talked the talk for a long, long time but I took 20 years to walk the walk.

AA is not religion.  It's *spiritual.*  'God' can be anything you want him/her/it to be.

Pick your God, and go.

PM me anytime and we can talk.  I want good things for you.

One night, my partner randomly clicked on the documentary ""Adderall.""  OMG! That's me! 

I hadn't understood what ADHD looked like in women, and how it can get worse with age.

Start with your regular doctor. Be prepared to discuss why you think it is ADHD, including a history of it in your life. Friends may be able to contribute useful anecdotes. If the doctor doesn't give it serious consideration, try another doctor.

You want Adderall or some other stimulant. The dr will want to rule out other medical issues, and may refer you to a neuropyschologist for evaluation. If the wait for that appt is long in your area (6 months in mine), argue for trying medication in the meantime. 

I presented a detailed plan to abuse caffeine to save my job, and asked for a medical opinion of how much harm it would do me.  That convinced the dr to try Adderal for me.  It works for me and I have relatively few side effects.

You will know if it is working. Even at a low starter dose.

So it's totally normal and okay that you *feel* anxious about this...it just means you are invested in your project.   But remind your emotional self that *feelings aren't reality*.  This may seem like a ""duh"" but you just have to back up the thought with the FACTS of your situation.  

Part of it too, is that as ADHDers (especially if unmedicated) we are very connected to our emotions in an immediate fashion, and it's very hard to step back from our feelings.  Now adays, I feel like there's sort of 2 people living in me;  the really analytical me, and the emotional me.  I have these gut reactions to things, and then the analytical me can say ""yes that's a valid feeling, but it doesn't comprise the whole situation.""  It's worth noting that I've only been able to develop this since I started medication...and what's more, if I haven't taken my meds that day, it's not nearly as accessible.","dw28qza",3,1521656509,"2018-03-21 18:21:49"

"4546","I’m a 29 yo male aspiring entrepreneur. I use a Sunday thru Saturday pill container that’s divided into morning and night sections. A significant challenge was getting into the habit of refilling it. One way that’s really helped me with that is incorporating the pill box into my morning routine.

I’ve been working on developing the habit of waking up at 5am every morning. I use a wake up light that sits across my room facing me, it starts brightening up at 4:30am and then alarm (wake up light alarm or phone alarm, still experimenting) goes off at 5am. I highly recommend a wake up light, best way I’ve found to wake up.

When I get out of bed I walk across my room to my wake up light where I also have my pill box, my phone, a glass of water covered by foil, a blender bottle full of water, and a small plastic cup with a scoop of my preworkout covered with a paper cupcake cup.

I take my morning med and supp stack, chug the glass of water, dump the preworkout in the blender bottle, blend and drink, rinse/refill waters and refill preworkout cup, turn off wake up light, and start working out. I leave my phone there and don’t use it until my entire morning routine is complete, including the rest of the routine after working out.

Incorporating the pill box into my morning routine has helped immensely with the accountability of refilling it.  I didn’t develop this routine for the pill box responsibility specifically, that was just an added bonus and thought it related to your post. This method has allowed me to know immediately what to do upon waking up, which is very important for having the willpower to get out of bed. I feel like absolute shit when out of bed, like a mild form of torture (dizzy, can barely stand, disoriented, wanting sooo bad to get back into bed), but I remember that in 15-20 minutes I won’t feel like that anymore. It also allows me to wake up to hydration, very important after a 5+ hour fasting of water.

I have very severe ADHD (and a unique type at that), so this is a routine I am still still fighting to have more consistency with, I’m sure many can relate. My struggle with ADHD has been dark and frustrating - attempting to implement these types of habits has helped. If anyone has questions or wants to talk about anything feel free to reach out.

I would recommend things like Quest bars, I eat a lot of atkins bars (currently eating somewhat low carb), and then there are good liquid meal replacement options.  I used to drink a lot of the Naked juice w/ protein added, and I also tend to make my own smoothies a lot.  For me, this normally includes a fruit like an apple or a splash of frozen berries or something, a banana, some plain yogurt, a spoon of peanut butter, and a bit of protein powder.  You can fit a ton of calories into a smoothie, and then you can sip it over the course of a few hours.

Easy-to-eat sandwiches are awesome.  My personal favorite is peanut butter + marshmallow fluff on whole wheat bread.  Dried fruit is also surprisingly caloric and easy to consume, like mango, pineapple, cranberries, etc., and mixed nuts are another great source of calories, fiber, protein, etc.

The other key ingredient is probably eggs.  Back in college, I used to make ramen on the stove.  I'd crack eggs directly into the water and put some frozen peas or whatever in the mix.  Super easy, very tasty.

The other thing you should do is take Zantac (ranitidine) -- you can buy a bunch on amazon pretty cheap.  My doctor told me I can take it 2x/day if necessary.","d3c0m2k",1,1463687300,"2016-05-19 19:48:20"

"4580","Based on your own description, I would not call you high functioning at all- you sound like a normal ADHD girl. There are a lot of stereotypes and ignorance about what ADHD is. Natural intelligence, learned coping mechanisms, habits instilled in upbringing- these things might have helped you survive with less difficulties than some of your peers, but they do not mean that you do not have ADHD, or that the diagnosis isn't suitable.

I used to get a lot of backlash and disbelief from teachers/professors when I was first diagnosed because I was not visibly physically hyperactive (save for some minor fidgeting), never had academic problems, was intelligent enough to be an A student without having to study (thanks, hyperfocus👍) 

-- but we all have a limit somewhere, where the ADHD bleeds through and makes life difficult. In America, this is a requirement for diagnosis, it has to have elements that affect your life adversely. 

When I got to university, my ""natural"" talent wasn't enough. Because I never learned how to study, I was screwed and had to relearn how to learn. My emotional dysregulation was probably the worst part, and most damaging to my life.

This is not the ""classic"" picture of ADHD, but it IS ADHD.

"4603","With all due respect, not everyone has these terrible results like you make it sound, by using words like ""you"" and ""people"" so matter of factly.

I just I feel like I have a decent amount to contribute as someone who took adderall daily for 13 years and quit a month ago (Age 11-24).

I don't know if I really did need adderall in middle school and high school. It certainly turned me from a sloppy C student into a straight A good ole boy. I just don't know if it was worth the negative side effects for me (I'm thinking probably not in my case). 

What I do know is that I'm fucking pissed that it was just assumed that I'd be taking adderall for the rest of my life. It was just something I stopped questioning. I had a disease, so I had to take my medicine. Just like someone with bad eyesight needs glasses right? 

It was the sleeplessness, loss of appetite, the migraines, and the moodiness, the anxiety, and the extreme dehydration, that made me question putting this chemical into my body. So I just eventually started tapering down and realizing that every time I took less, I was actually a happier person than the day before. I moved to another city and saw that as an opportunity for changes. I just kinda went to a miniscule dose then just stopped. I suck at video games now, I get tired a lot, my house looks pretty dirty right now, and I've never been happier.

Theres no doubt that I'm less productive now that I've quit. I honestly don't give a fuck though, because I get to live in the moment instead of frantically trying to come up with more things to feel dopamine about. My life is on a schedule now because I get to listen when my body tells me how hungry or tired I am. I'm in my first real relationship because I stopped approaching social situations like a calculation and learned to act like myself.

I'm not against people needing adderall, but make goddamn sure you need it before you just keep on taking it. I don't know what I did to outgrow my issues, but I did, and I probably could have quit 4 or 5 years earlier. My life's not perfect, but it never will be. Its seriously fine that people who need this take it, but I spent too much of my youth worrying instead of enjoying life because of this stuff and I know for a fact I'm not the only one.

"4612","I know the struggle well. What I do want to say though, is don’t underestimate your teachers. Obviously under different circumstances when you’re attending regular classes in person, I’d recommend you approach them in person and just ask them for some help. Consider sending an email if you feel comfortable and ask them to keep it between the two of you if you feel as though you can. The struggle with ADHD I think also comes from our inability to ask because we feel too ashamed or prideful, or the reverse where we feel like such a mess that we can’t ask because we’re just in too deep and there’s no point. I only struggle alone when I don’t reach out, and that’s still a lesson I’m learning. I’ve been given so many extensions and so much additional help simply because I asked. Don’t be afraid to ask if you need it. I had school accommodations and never used a single one because they never truly helped me, but what really helped were the extensions I got and the understanding I had between my teachers after being open. They all know someone with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I’m not saying that you’ll get these results with all teachers, and I’m also not necessarily saying that all teachers will react kindly at all, but you’d be surprised at what they’re willing to do if you ask the right ones.","fpg1zi9",1,1588591744,"2020-05-04 11:29:04"

It is a cost effective way of seeing if a medication works without an expensive script. The food payment (less than $10 in this case) idea is of course to influence a physician into prescribing a drug, and it involves meeting the rep and listening to what they have to say. There is no other compensation, no other contract of sorts, and the physician isn't forced or coerced in any way to write the prescription. It's just another option that they know about.


 He prescribed it because he believed that the drug will help me. He wanted to try what was considered the safest option first (being a low risk, non-addictive substance), then expand from there.  This is the most compensation he received, and it has been a couple years since any other compensation occurred.


I will bring this up when I speak with him next week. He's no idiot and I don't think a couple of presentations will sway his medical judgment. I would say that on an ethical spectrum, this occurrence is minor compared to what other physicians do for pharmaceutical companies.

I am doing all the things you have suggested with the exception of letting her go run around before doing her work.

 I have tried after school sports, she has done basketball, cheerleading, and even played football for a couple of months. She quickly loses interest and either just stops paying attention and does her own thing or she tries to take over and ""runs over"" everyone. 

I think that a lot of my frustration is coming more from my own inability to keep consistency with organization, distractions, etc. I have her come in and do her work in the evenings so I don't lose her focus right off. Then it is dinner time. She has free/play time after dinner computer, Nexus, iPad, outside, crafts, etc. she has trouble even focusing on games for more than a few min at a time. After that I have her shower, then we make sure everything is packed up shoes, clothes, jacket etc are ready for the next morning. After that it's reading time, she reads great but has trouble with comprehension because she just can't focus enough to take it in. I have her read out loud to try and help her slow down. After reading its bedtime routine. Things are getting somewhat better at home but it doesn't seem to matter how much improvement I can get here at home school is still on a downward spiral.

"4681","It's pretty normal to see that dropoff, and doesn't necessarily mean you need to increase your dosage.  The first day you take it, if you've taken stimulants before, your brain is having this brand new and exciting experience that amplifies everything.  You want to take advantage of it because just being able to take advantage of the feeling is brand new and exciting, too.  It's very typical, however, that as you get used to feeling more capable, you'll find some old bad habits trickling back in.  Being capable and having a more functional brain stops being exciting and starts being mundane, and then you really find out that tackling ADHD is still going to take some more work.

This is the reason that many people (myself included!) find the best results in treatment by combining meds and therapy.  A professional therapist (one who you're comfortable with and understands ADHD well) can help you break old habits and build new ones to take better advantage of the medication.  Often times, those of us who get diagnosed as adults have built up a whole structure of coping mechanisms to get through life.  Then we finally take medication, and those coping mechanisms that worked so well for our ADHD brains can actually make things harder on our medicated brains.

At the end of the day, your psych doc is the one best qualified to comment on your medication.  Be as honest with them as possible, and hopefully they will treat you with quality care.  I do recommend, though, that if you have the time/money/motivation to get some extra help, to invest it in a quality therapist as well for the rest of the day-to-day life stuff.","efhh1br",1,1548982620,"2019-02-01 00:57:00"
"4682","That is definitely pretty similar to how I felt when I first started taking Adderall about 2 months ago - it was amazing to be able to think clearly for what felt like the first time ever but also slightly unnerving at the same time...

The 'edge' definitely goes away. Before taking it, I had heard it described as getting glasses for the first time having that carthatic sensation of visual clarity. This definitely captures how it felt for me, at least emotionally (Except unlike getting glasses, this one might actually help me save my marriage, thank god, so even better... but that is a whole different can-of-worms...). As time goes on nothing actually changes strictly-speaking, but you get used to the sensation just like you do with glasses.

Hope this helps (i.e. hope you need corrective lens's otherwise my analogy is utterly useless to you...) ;)

The sum of who we are includes both our genetics as well as our environment. Someone with parents who deny that ADHD is real is in a very different place than someone who has supportive parents who recognize and support the medical and psychological care a child with ADHD needs to thrive.

ADHD can be an incredibly alienating disorder. It can adversely impact relationships to a great extent. ADHD can easily strip away love, support, and understanding from us when we need it the most. When we are frustrated, sad, or angry. Even the people we love use our emotional impulsivity to invalidate our feelings.

Back on medicine.... After a long hiatus.   No contest. Medicine is better for me.

  I'll bet that your creativity and problem solving is still there.  Your medicated brain is just filtering the random distractions better so your not experiencing the mushroom mash of juxtaposition in your head that was a fountain of creative inspiration.  The technical skills are still there. The problem solving brain power is still there. You just need to relearn to intentionally explore your creative inspiration instead of relying on the random whirlwind in your head spitting out juxtaposition that you could use as ""creativity"".   Your just not used to artificially having to start that engine to get the fan blades spinning for that whirlwind.

You just need to figure out how to get your new laser light focus to focus on being intentionally creative.

When one (or at least myself) is deprived of such entitlement, I think you suddenly have this feeling that you are not good enough for your friend, family or the loved ones around you.

"4762","These are some good tips!! I’ve got a couple as well which could help :)

If you’re screaming internally at yourself to go do something but your body is sayin no, say it out loud. If you need to do the washing up say ‘I’m going to get up and do the washing up’. It works every time

There’s some good playlists on Spotify for studying, my favourite is Study Jazz, it’s four hours long so you don’t get bored of the same stuff (I can give a link if people want :))

Always underestimate how long something will take you. Time doesn’t exists for us, so what you think might take 15 minutes, give time for 30. This also allows for stupid ass mistakes we all love to make (getting distracted by your cat, or you can’t find the thing you need). 

If you can, set some time for yourself at the start of the day (which is easier now it’s lockdown). I like to give myself half an hour in the morning after taking my meds to just sit and do something I enjoy, sometimes watching YouTube, sometimes on reddit. When that time is up go and do your work. This really helps with my sleeping, as I often put off going to sleep knowing I have to face another day of doing work, but I’m more likely going to bed earlier knowing I’ve got something fun to do in the morning (even better if you have some tasty food waiting for you. I’m straight out of bed if I know I’ve got exciting food downstairs for me 😂)","fqlg569",1,1589457157,"2020-05-14 11:52:37"

"4764","I am going through a wedding as well and rely greatly on a ""Wedding Action Book"" (I titled it W.A.B.) It helps greatly because I feel (and know) that I don't have to constantly think about my wedding to remember something. Everything I need to do is in MY booklet. Here are some tips:

1) If you don't have a booklet yourself, create your own W.A.B. Put all the actions you need to get done and put a date when they should be done by. When you get home, go through it daily to check off when needs to be done. This allows you to trust that you won't forget stuff.

2) Trust yourself. You feel you have to think about wedding stuff or you will forget it. You have a W.A.B., so what ever you think about wedding stuff ASAP response in your head should be ""Ill check my WAB later."" Every time a wedding thought comes to mind, say this.

3) Separate different time periods mentally by creating ""mindsets"" for yourself. Before going to work, your mind set is ""I am going to work to work"" and that is all you will do. Avoid bringing wedding stuff mentally (or emotionally) to work, this may mean avoid talking about your wedding with your co-workers... so be it.

Its like creating a daily schedule. You have separate time periods for separate tasks. You are at work to work.

4) Hyper Focusing is just a way to explain what we do, but in reality what the issue is caused by is not overly focusing but having issues getting our focus OFF of a task. Avoid doing wedding stuff in the morning before work, and only start wedding stuff when you come home. You start wedding stuff and thinking about wedding stuff while at home before work, thats all your going to do all day.

5) Emotions create more emotions. If you create negativity for your mistakes your just going to create negativity for other areas in your life. Forgive yourself. Love yourself. You make a mistake. Oops. Whatever. Trust that you are doing the best you can because you ARE. That is all there is too it.

6) You do not need to be negative towards yourself. In the past you may have been hurt by others because of your ADHD, so you carry a huge amount of shame with you. You don't need to feel shame or guilt.","d5sa6ew",2,1469578848,"2016-07-27 00:20:48"

Hell I can’t show up to X event or even if I do I have to follow a script to avoid offending people. They also act like I owe them everything when they were terrible to me growing up and still are. My gf of 3 years is about ready to leave the country because of the shade our family’s keep throwing at us. 

We got hate mail for not attending a 4th baby shower, 3 hours away even though they won’t visit if they are literally in our town. People are crazy entitled, hypocritical, and selfish these days and you just gotta go a different direction. I have some really amazing friends that have been there when my family wouldn’t I would probably help him before half of my blood relatives.

I’ve learned I will never be good enough for some people and they are a waste of my positive energy because they take advantage of me time and time again. Also I try to reflect on myself and my actions a lot and have found that many people just don’t do that because it’s easier to blame other people than look in the mirror. I stopped taking it personal and just assume I seem either careless or vulnerable so they must choose me to fuck with. Unfortunately I’m not the one sometimes because I’m bipolar too and will blow up after a point.

I’m confident things will get better because I prioritize my friends/relationships differently now and only spoke when spoken to. I’ve been successful in college and hope it reflects in the work force(double major in engineering) so I can hold that one over their self-righteous heads one day. 

I’ve also adopted a zen-like mindset in the way that by putting up with people I am freeing myself and not holding myself back due to resentment. Also that it will all benefit me one day and I will realize the importance of duty and my detachment from my negative feelings toward things will help me enjoy them and learn more in the long run.

While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

"4811","Ok this is gonna be hard to explain but like basically you have to train you inner voice (CBT) and a lot of trial and error. This will depend also on how cold / attached the other person is ofc, and yourself in general.

First I identify I have this with someone. Then I try to fight the impulses. E.g. I wanna text them. I'll say to myself: have you talked with them today? No, ok send that meme. Or yes, 5 times:  wait till tomorrow. Distract yourself to stop thinking. I play a videogame (6h passed and I've forgotten they exist, also to eat dinner or sleep). Take a step back: you had a life before them. Remember your other friends, partner, family, school, hobbies. See the big picture. 

If nothing above works I'll be like: brain if you don't stop this it's gonna be like Jake [awesome friendship ruined by this] do you want that again???? And I'll immediately back off because it hurts and no I don't want it again. 

And when it fades.... DON'T BREAK ALL ATTACHMENTS. Remind yourself you like this person. Set fixed meets (""let's have coffee every Wednesday after work""), put reminders / alarms to text them (I do this even with my best friend bc I suck at keeping in touch). Be honest if you're ignoring them, say it's not personal and hope they believe you. Sometimes people simply leave and it's not your fault. But if they like you back, they won't let you go that easy, they'll text you and propose plans FOR THE LOVE OF GOD REPLY OR SAY YES.

To me, the only hint of a possible feeling of love towards him is revealed when you state that's he's the only guy you ever even considered being that honest with. The most interesting piece to your comment is your by-the-way he's supposed to be moving in with me next week.  

Are you sure you're ready to live with a guy/this guy?  Now, you've been with him seven months and he's the first guy you've ever considered being this honest with makes me think that you're entering a different stage in life when a relationship is taking on more meaning, but not to the point where you're ready to live with someone.

Decide if you REALLY are interested in being with him on that level.  If you're not, then go ahead and end it and don't tell him.  The cheating is just an expression of something else going on inside.  Keep this in mind, if he's moving into YOUR place and you deep down don't want this, it will NEVER be good.

Relax. Breathe. 

I don't know your specific situation, but it is HIGHLY unlikely that this exam will destroy your entire life. It might delay your plans, or cost you more time/money down the road, but as far as I know most exams are able to be retaken, although you may have to redo a course. Redoing a course isn't the worst thing in the world. I had to do the equivalent of high school Math 10 three times, and I am a functioning (mostly) adult human who kicked my last mandatory math class in the ass. 

I doubt you're lazy. It sounds like you were distracted and ill-equipped to manage your time. This particular test/course may be a write-off, but I hope you can learn from this experience. Get the help you need. Talk to your teachers/professors. Find out what resources, such as a tutoring centre or counselling, may be available to you for cheap or free through school. 

I hope you don't take this as me being dismissive. I'm honestly not trying to be. I know this feeling. It happens when I lose my keys, again. It happens when I forget something important for work, again. It happens when I could have done a simple thing to make my life easier but for some reason I simply didn't do The Thing.   


You're not lazy; you're distracted. You're not good-for-nothing; you are a part of several communities - your family, friends, social circle, etc. - that are better because you are there. You're not a loser; you're a person who tried and things blew up in your face. And even if you were a loser, nothing says you have to stay a loser.

It's okay to be angry that you didn't get the help you needed, that people failed you.  This is a necessary part of the grieving process as well, and if you don't let yourself get mad, it's much less likely you'll be able to let go.  I had to be very angry at my parents for a while, that they could not/did not get me the help I needed for my ADHD and depression when I was a teen.

Why should we benefit from the performance enhancing aspects of the medication, but deny that to others?  
To be clear, it's not the people trying to take if for performance enhancing, it's the system that locks of such drugs from the majority of people because of a few bad apples.  
It's the system that causes these people to fake their illness.

Because serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine are all catecholamines, pretty much every drug that effects one will also have effects on the others. We call things SNRIs which act most strongly on serotonin and norepinephrine, but none are actually selective enough to avoid acting on dopamine as well. The system is very interconnected.

* Note Classes 5, 6, and 7 are not considered ""official ADHD Medicines"" by the FDA but are considered medicines for other disorders such as Daytime Sleepiness (Class 5) and Depression (Class 6 and 7)

* Yet we do know Classes 5, 6, and 7 do treat ADHD.  They just

 * Treat ADHD in less people than Classes 1, 2, 3, and 4.  This is the case with Class 6 (Bupropion)

 * They can have very rare side effects that make them not recommended for treating ADHD in children, at least until you try all the other options, and even in adults you should probably try Classes 1, 2, 3, and 4 first.  This is the case with Class 5 (Modafinil)

 * They have a lot of very common side effects, side effects that are more common and less desirable than the first 4 classes of ADHD medications and thus you try these meds last if the first 4 classes do not work.  This is the case with Class 7 (The Tricyclic Antidepressants).

* Yet even if Class 5, 6, and 7 have some form of downside compared to Classes 1, 2, 3, and 4... they may be a medicine your doctor wants to try at an earlier treatment step if you have a coexisting condition that these medicines also treat besides ADHD such as depression, or daytime sleepiness.  Or your doctor may want to try these meds earlier if you have anxiety, with trying class 3 and 4 earlier, and/or trying classes 5, 6, and 7 prior to trying the stimulants.","d5hgjrs",2,1468884545,"2016-07-18 23:29:05"

"4947","I'd suggest keeping a journal and note how you feel each day. In my experience (also on Adderall XR) the effects are very subtle. I wasn't sure if it was working at first too, but realized that the XR really just didn't last long for me. I took it in the morning and it would wear off early in the afternoon. If I didn't do any studying in the morning, I'd swear it had no effects at all. I'd maybe suggest taking it closer to when you are actually going to do work. For example, take it, then immediately go to the library and start studying. I found it was still hard to get started, but once I did, I could stay on task and focus more easily. It's possible that it is really not working for you, but I'd try those sorts of things to put it to the test and get a better idea. You could be in the same situation where you need to take it twice a day - or perhaps you need an increase or a different medication. 

Also, make sure you're drinking water throughout the day, eating regularly (and healthy), and have a consistent sleep schedule. You probably already know you should be doing this, but it really can change how the medication affects you. If you're tired, it may have something to do with those things as well. 

It's also worth noting that vitamin C can affect the absorption of Adderall. Just in case you're taking a multivitamin/vitamin C with your meds (or eating foods that are rich in it around the time you take it).","erlmo60",2,1560991288,"2019-06-20 00:41:28"

Do these geniuses think Einstein just sat at his office desk not moving looking at his notes for 8+ straight hours every fucking weekday watching the clock like a hawk waiting for his ideas to just sort of fall out?

These people don't want passion from you. They want compliance. Passion is the dirty corporate word that every exec uses to sell a job to you and keep you underpaid. ""You should work here, we have *passion*."" ""What do you mean you want a raise, aren't you *passionate* about this opportunity?"" They use this kind of catch all language to put the onus of your miserable job on *you*. It's *your* fault the job sucks, if only you were more *passionate*. It's *your* fault you don't earn enough, you'd do better and consequently earn more if you were more *passionate*. It's you're fault we don't pay you more or give stronger raises, you should be happy to be here because it fulfils your *passion*. See how it goes both ways, that your passion is both the source of and answer to your misery?

That's because what passion means is emotional longing so strong as to lead to suffering. Suffering for something because you love it so dearly. Hence ""the *passion* of Christ"", literally suffering to death out of love for others. That's what your company wants out of you.

Fuck passion. This is work. I trade my knowledge, skill, and time for your money. If you aren't passionate about paying me my expected rate for this work, under conditions I find acceptable, then I'm not passionate about the work you need done.

"4970","Wellbutrin does affect dopamine and norepinephrine, which are the things targeted by stims. It doesn't seem to affect extracellular dopamine levels though, looking at the german wikipedia page. 

I think the pharmacodynamics of both types of drugs should be different enough to try them out, seeing as wellbutrin has metabolites that also affect the brain in various ways, making the drug a lot less straightforward than amphetamines and MPH. 

I don't think this excessive fear is all that warranted, but he is the medical professional and I am merely an enthusiast for psychopharmacology, so you should probably ask him about it. 

""Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI).[13] It has also been found to act as a releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones.[75][76][77] However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism.[13][75] These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself.[13][75][78] The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20 times greater than those of bupropion itself.[13] Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.[13][75][79]""

In short, bupropion has metabolites that do a lot more than stims ever would, so stims would probably have wildly different effects. ","e10ivyr",2,1529530753,"2018-06-20 21:39:13"

My initial few days on vyvanse were very emotional, I had a big wave of sadness well up due to something, went through my CBT process that I internalized long ago when depression was the ''only thing that could be wrong.'' 

Funny story, after suppressing the other thought, I got even sadder a few moments later though, after I had reasoned the first emotion into a mixed happy sad thing  (logical for what it was.)

"5023","I think your situation and struggles are unfortunately very relatable to a lot of people here. I very clearly remember similar struggles in school back when I really didn't have any understanding of ADHD or even know that I had it. It can be so difficult when you know people look at you as if you're lazy and don't care about your work and all that stuff, but in your mind you know that that's not really the case. When there is no understanding that it could possibly be due to something like ADHD it becomes very easy to believe all of these things and have it lead to other issues like depression.

I also remember when I finally started researching it more and just like you it was a bit overwhelming. It was like everything just sort of clicked, all of the times I'd find it unbearable to do homework wasn't due to me just being lazy, all of the days the teacher would give detentions for daydreaming and not paying attention wasn't me just not caring, all of the same comments like ""has so much potential but just needs to try"" wasn't because I was just choosing not to try. The list goes on and on...

With the relationship with your father you've just always gotta keep in mind that he was in the wrong here, there's no excuse for how he treated you. It seems like you really want to work on this relationship though and move forward from the past. ADHD brings difficulties to any relationship, but personally from what I've noticed one of the best ways to reduce these difficulties is to be open with the other person about it and discuss it with them. Allowing them to have that level of understanding about your situation and your struggles will help bring clarity to them the same way it did for you when you started researching ADHD more.

Maybe consider bringing it up with your father sometime, do it in a good relaxed situation where you've got time to talk about it. I'd also just be cautious not to make it seem as if you're trying to make him feel bad for the ways he's treated you in the past, he's apologized for that and that's not the objective here. The objective would be just to give him that opportunity to try and understand, maybe bring up some of the past struggles as far as your difficulties with school, work, life, etc. and how they correlate to ADHD.

There is a lot of great information out there on how to manage the negative aspects of ADHD, and this subreddit in particular has loads of it. I'd recommend bringing it up with your doctor and getting an official diagnosis as well. If you feel as if it really has negative affects on your day to day life you might also want to talk with your doctor about trying medication and seeing how that goes for you.

Best of luck, keep pushing forward and use the understanding to your advantage and not as an excuse!","d46jl2s",2,1465769974,"2016-06-12 22:19:34"
"5024","Same here. Sorry you had to go through that. My parents dismissed my obvious signs if chronic depression and executive function disorder because I was the youngest of 4 and they made it very clear that I was an accident and they were pretty over raising children when they had me (they said this a lot).they werent the worst parents, never really mean. Just rarely present and not all that persistently interested in my well-being. Hence it took me a lifetime to understand that I'd developed while having a severe learning and mental functioning disability as well as being chronically depressed. I had spent so many decades like this it was all I had ever known. 

Now that I can use medication to help a little I at least know what the problem is which helps me combat it. Overcoming the tremendous loss of life experiences and emotional growth that I was robbed of because I was perpetually an anhedonic shut-in who couldn't concentrate or care about anything, that is what I find difficult. I have an ok relationship with my parents but anytime they or my siblings comment on what a ""quiet strange kid"" I was it just fills me with pain and sadness. Like, I was drowning and had no idea life could have been any better. You all saw, you all could have done something. But no one cared enough to. 

I don't know about you, but the only way I have been able to survive shit like that is just to move on and invest emotionally in people in my life who have proven to be dependable friends/family.

Find a good therapist, work as hard as you can, be honest with yourself and accept that some days will be total shit. Seek improvement and learn how to love yourself and give yourself space, time and understanding. ","e9kf329",1,1542046839,"2018-11-12 18:20:39"

"5074","It depends on the doctor that you see. Also, they will probably take you more seriously if you mention that it runs in your family because it is often genetic. In addition, your doctor will give you a test to take which will help them issue a concrete diagnosis. I was 17 when I was diagnosed and my pediatrician managed my prescription until I aged out and had to start seeing a psychiatrist. Depending on where you live it is really hard to get an appointment with a psychiatrist so if you still see a pediatrician I would start there or with your general health physician because they might help refer you or be able to prescribe you something. My pediatrician was able to prescribe a wide variety of ADHD medications to help find the right one for me, but the one that she said she never prescribes is Adderall because of the street value and kids with this prescription are sometimes pressured into sharing their medication with friends, etc. So if you find a doctor that can prescribe you something, they won't deny you medication if you do in fact have ADHD, but they might be careful about which medications they give you. If a doctor tells you that you have ADHD but they are't willing to prescribe you anything then go to another doctor and see what they say. Best of luck!","duolu2i",1,1519348447,"2018-02-23 01:14:07"

"5078","Some things that worked for me:

\- Putting the phone away/out of reach. It seems to be the #1 distraction most of the time.

\- Play some background music (lo-fi) or white noise. Try to find what works for you. For reading, I like some rain sounds in the background. For writing, I play some lo-fi music on YouTube.

\- Personally, I try to do 30 minutes of work, then take a 5-10 minute break. You can look up a customizable Pomodoro timer for this, if you want.

\- With breaks, you probably shouldn't pick up the phone or get on the internet. Try getting up and grabbing a snack or some coffee. Something that really helps me is going outside or doing a little bit of exercise. Exercise is great for the ADHD brain.

We definitely struggle to manage our stress in situations like this. I recognise the way you're combining all your problems together, like they're all equally important right now - I do the same thing. I'm also familiar with feeling like everyone hates me when I'm not feeling good about myself. 


As for advice I'll boil down the few things I've learned:

* It is *never* your 'last chance' while you're still drawing breath. 

* People always seem to hate you when you're feeling badly about yourself. You'll feel differently when you feel less overwhelmed.

*  Coming clean is *never* as bad as you think it is. You're just feeling the fear right now, but after comes the relief and it is incredible.

* Pretentious quote alert: Our greatest fears lie in anticipation. Nothing is ever as bad as you think it will be. Not flunking out, or breaking up - even bereavement.

* This sounds so trite, but being tired makes everything seem so much worse. However bad you feel when you wake up, it won't be as bad as you feel right now.

However it hasn't exactly been a drill sergeant, as it hasn't really helped me ""pulled myself together"" get up, make breakfast, drink coffee, clean up, make homework etc.. But helped me relax more in social situations, not being stressed and having 10 000 of non-useful dumbass stressful thoughts everyday. However I'm in a proces where I've just started using it in combination with a stimulants, and believe that I can make a great and solid dose of medicine, that is helpful with not only reducing anxiety and stress, but also help with pulling myself together and making homework and house work done. However if you do choose to try Intuniv (guanfacine) I'll recommend you to be patient with it, as it can make you extremely drowsy the first month you try it. After 1 month or 1,5 month, I'd say it's a more proper time to really make a review of the drug, because then you have given your brain time to adapt to the drug. Some say that Aderall has the effect of a drill seargeant telling them to get work done, maybe it can have that effect on you as well, if you try it. Of course, as anyone says, the medicine works in different ways depending on whoever who takes it, but I do believe that the stimulants that you haven't try might have potential to help you with your situation in better ways then Vyvanse.

Anyway, everyone experiences different side effects. For me, after almost half a year now on adderall, worst side effect for me is weight loss... I'm not even gonna call it loss of appetite, because I've *always* had very low appetite. Anyway, adderall doesn't make me depressed, in fact it does the opposite... It seems like I think so much more clearly now that I'm on it, making me less impulsive, more confident, increasing my self-esteem... Before starting it I was just unmotivated and shy and sad.

Finding the proper dose is more about tolerance than randomness, imo. At first I took 10mg once per day, then twice per day, then 20mg in the morning and 10mg in the afternoon, and last month I moved up to 20mg twice per day which I'm pretty convinced I'll never need to move up.

Every time I kill a person  in a game I immediately start obsessing about my virtual victim's family. The wife or husband, his or her children and loved ones. I robbed those poor people of a normal life and for what? Just because some text box told me their loved one was the enemy? 

What if they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time? What if my victim had no choice but to be the person in front of my gun/sword/wmd? What gives me the right to be their judge, jury, and executioner?

I particularly vivid memory I have for example:

I was ~15. I was playing Civilization 3(?) on a huge Earth map as France and Germany had built a city in a location I had *really* wanted so, of course, I declared war on those kraut bastards (/s). I killed a lone warrior hanging out by the Red Sea and immediately felt a **massively** overwhelming surge of guilt. I started crying and couldn't stop. I cried for a solid 15-20 minutes of the monster I suddenly felt I'd become. 

I didn't play civ for several years after that.

"5119","Yeah, luckily I was in collegiate track when I first started taking meds and had a regimented eating system down.. It's kinda turned into a shit show though now out in the real world. It was really bad for the first year. Luckily I'm into hiking and the outdoors community who understand having to eat even though you ""don't feel hungry"". (But like not due to being ADHD so it makes me feel more normal about it) Anywho, having those people around reminds me to eat more or at least electrolytes/calories into my body at more regular intervals. I make google calendar appts to remind me of lunch (even just with myself) and I try to make dinner plans as much as possible to help too. The social aspect is one of the main reasons I eat now.

It's not a super drug, you may need a different dose (or different med), and you could have unwanted side effects. Plus, you'll probably need to learn how to manage your ""new brain"" before you can take your medication to get things done. The first day I took mine, I just talked nonstop for about 4 hours and then absolutely crashed and slept until dinner (about 7 hours).

"5152","Are you treating the ADHD/anxiety? It helps a lot to get those under control. I'm an undergrad, so not as intensive as what you're taking on rn, but I also have both and it's fukd me up a lot. If you don't have a therapist, maybe look into getting to see one; I first went to the student health clinic on my campus for free and as a walk-in, maybe you can find something similar? There, they had me see a psychiatrist after a few months of therapy to treat my depression and anxiety. They were really bad so it took a little while to get the right meds, and it wasn't until then that I began to address the adhd. My psychiatrist had me try adderall and I've been on it for about a year and a half. It has made so so much of a difference in my life. The whole of 2018 I was more productive than I had been the previous three years. 

I started carrying around a pocket notebook, I keep a planner/journal/notebook for my tasks and activities each day (most days). I don't know if you do this already but I keep coming back to breaking down tasks into annoyingly simple, actionable, minute, specific steps; it helps a lot when I'm overwhelmed or avoiding a task. IT feels like wasted time, spending too long planning a thing, but it's very helpful and once it's on paper you just follow steps, and crossing them out gives ur brain that dopamine hit, and u just ride the momentum. When my anxiety was really bad, I used this one app called ""Calm"" that has guided meditations. When I'd get overwhelmed or anxious, or panicky, I would often go hide in the restroom do a '3-minute body scan' and it helped so much.","f0t9w9q",1,1568918407,"2019-09-19 18:40:07"

"5181","This will probably be a ramble, with run on sentences, poor structure, and I will probably jump from topic to topic lol. I am 34 years old, will be 35 the end of this month, and was diagnosed ADHD combined type, depression, and general anxiety a few weeks ago. I have suspected ADHD within the past year. Took me quitting a 7-8 year run with alcohol to get out the fog, push aside denial, and take a look at myself to realize there may be something wrong. Once i learned the true definition and symptoms of ADHD, everything clicked. Also I found out my mom was also diagnosed as well, same type as well.

I grew up in a hectic household. A lot of love for sure, but a lot of yelling, swearing, and no patience, mostly my mom, though Im sure she rubbed off on my step dad over the years lol. I look back on all the times I got in trouble for getting lost in time playing Sega and not hearing an instruction or being told to shut it off. All the times I was called out for not paying attention in school because I was off in another world. All the times an interest of mine that didn't fit the typical ""what sport do you want to play"" attitude of my parents, was ridiculed to the point I felt shame for even being interested in it.  My two younger brothers who both have the same dad and are natural athletes played a bunch of sports, multiple leagues sometimes, and I kind of just existed in some of these sports. My brother who is about 2 years younger than me got a lot of praise and shine through out his whole athletic career. He broke records at the school, won a lot of trophy's, etc. As you can see, sports was a big deal in my house. ESPN was always on, and every day there was either practice, a  game, or something to go to. My step dad even was a ref as a side hustle. I say this to show how unless your hobby or interest was sports, it was not taken seriously. I wanted to get into Breakdancing when I was like 14, and I attended class for a little bit, but did not last long. I can remember my family making jokes about it, and my mom sometimes complaining that she had to drive me to it once or twice a week. Those little comments she made, they stick with you, even subconsciously sometimes. When you are an adult with more wisdom, you can look back at those moments through a different lenses and see them for what they really were.

I do get angry at how no one ever really tried to help me with my self esteem. I have always thought pretty low of myself, and even though i can be a social person and talkative, its obvious I have some insecurities, and self confidence issues. How my parents never dealt with it is beyond me. I guess my mom having undiagnosed adhd did not help growing up.","gi3l1m2",3,1609789215,"2021-01-04 19:40:15"

"5192","I have idiopathic hypersomnia with short sleep time. It's characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, regardless of how much/how well you slept the night before, with no apparent cause. It's similar to narcolepsy, but narcolepsy is more related to when your body goes into REM sleep, but IH doesn't have a strong correlation to REM, it just kind of means you're sleepy all the time. I used to fall asleep while driving, at my desk at work, during conversations, at parties, in bathrooms, in any kind of public transportation, you name it. I can at least identify when a sleep attack is coming on and prepare for it to some extent, which isn't always the case with narcolepsy, but if I know a sleep attack is coming, there isn't much I can do about it, I'm gonna fall asleep whether I like it or not. My ADHD and IH each exacerbate the other in a bit of a vicious cycle (if I'm having a really stressful day managing my ADHD symptoms, my brain just wants to go to sleep to make it all stop. If I'm sleepy, it makes my ADHD symptoms worse. And so on, and so forth.) Luckily, the recommended treatment for IH is stimulants, so for the most part, the meds that treat my ADHD also keep me awake. But I still have to keep up with really good sleep hygiene (if you don't know what sleep hygiene is, google it!) and keep short-acting meds in the car to make sure I can stay awake at appropriate times.

I bet taking a couple of months off to just let go of the pressure and expectations, to catch up on sleep, and let those stress hormones work themselves out of your system, will help immensely.

if that isn't a possibility, i'd say communicate with each other as much as possible and try to understand each other. for example tell him (at a good moment, while he's calm) that you understand that his anger issues are hard to control and ask him what he thinks you should do to calm him down during his bad moods. maybe make an agreement that he walks away and takes a time out when he feels a big wave of anger coming, so he won't take it out on you. 
i have to say it does worry me that you say he can get very mad at you and that he gets aggressive. remember that you're just a teen yourself and even tho it's really nice you want to help him, it's not your responsibility. it is very hard to control anger issues but it still doesn't give him the right to hurt you or your feelings. please think of yourself too and be safe.","g2y0iq3",1,1598471203,"2020-08-26 19:46:43"

Haha, I dare you to google ""Adderall tolerance"" &amp; then get back to me. But the answer is most certainly, ""yes, it can &amp; does occur even with legal dosages"".

&gt;Adderall is classified as a Schedule II drug because of the potential for abuse and dependence.

&gt;**Understanding Dependency and Tolerance**

&gt;It is possible to develop a dependency for Adderall, especially if large doses have been taken for an extended period of time. However, even if the drug has been used only for a short time, the body may become accustomed to it. Dependency means that the body has become accustomed to having the drug delivered each day and expects the chemicals to be made without an organ’s help. When this is stopped, and the drug is removed from the system, it is hard for the body to work properly. **Adderall tolerance may also occur. This occurs when a person takes the drug for a period of time and then needs to increase the dose to feel the same effects. The body is capable of building up a tolerance to all forms of amphetamines, including Adderall.**

This is a comprehensive resource:
http://prescription-drug.addictionblog.org/tolerance-to-adderall/

&gt;**But as you use Adderall over time, doctors expect that you will develop some form of tolerance to Adderall.** Your doctor will work with you to observe which concentration of amphetamine salts works best for you to adjust for and work around Adderall tolerance.","ccnoa9k",1,1381262266,"2013-10-08 19:57:46"

I did the big full screening diagnostic thing, it took like... 8ish hours over the course of 2 weeks.  The hardest bit was that I wasn't allowed to have any coffee/caffeine on testing days, b/c apparently that's a common self-medication strategy for folks with ADHD.  I was very lucky to have a doctor who specialized in adult ADHD diagnosis, which was cool.  

After I got the diagnosis- I was so angry.  I spent months angry.  There are a ton of things that would have been so much easier for me in college with the disability accommodations I'd have been entitled to, and also in my working life over the past decade.  I'd screwed up some relationships and some financial stuff in part because of how ADHD impacted me.  It was hard, therapy helped, but occasionally I still feel mad that it took so long for me to get diagnosed.  

And weirdly, the ADHD meds helped my anxiety immensely.  At first I was like ""dude, doctor guy, why are you giving an anxious lady stimulants this is gonna be a shit show.""

"5243","Talk to your doctor about adding a medication or changing a medication.  Medications you can suggest.

* Strattera, a non stimulant ADHD medication.  Has been approved for ADHD for over a decade now.  Has no abuse potential.  Helps dopamine in the frontal lobe of the brain but not in the addiction centers.

* Intuniv, a non stimulant ADHD medication.  Has been approved for ADHD for 5 years now.  A extended release form of a blood pressure medicine that has been around since the 1980s.  The extended release version is more even so less side effects and more ADHD benefits.  No addictive potential.  While it does not modify dopamine (thus no addictive potential) it helps enhance electrical activity in the frontal lobe by modifying how nerve cells communicate with each other via activating an norepinephrine receptor called alpha2a which enhances electrical activity in the frontal lobe.

* Wellbutrin, an antidepressant called a Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor.  Off label ADHD med, On label Antidepressant and Anti-Smoking med.  This does enhance dopamine in the reward system of the brain but it does it over a period of weeks instead of less than an hour like instant release stimulants.  It does it so gradually that it is actually used as a treatment to people who have addictions such as smoking, compulsive gambling, and compulsive over-eating for by raising the baseline of dopamine in the brain without creating a surge you reduce the want to do these compulsive activities so your brain gets dopamine.  Theoretical addictive potential but in reality the opposite is observed with this being a medicine that reduces addiction and this it is approved by the FDA as an anti-smoking drug.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Stimulants, theoretical addictive potential but the two drugs I am about to recommend have no ways to alter the delivery mechanism to get high.

* Vyvanse a modification of an amphetamine called a pro drug.  What is a pro drug you ask?  It is an inert molecule when your body takes the drug, your body can't get high off this inert molecule for it can't cross the blood brain barrier in its inert state.  Your body slowly breaks it down via an enzyme that makes this inert molecule into two substances, the amino acid lysine and the dexamphetamine.  The only way to break down this drug is via the enzyme and your enzyme can only do so much of the drug at one time, stomach acid, or heat will not break down the drug.  Thus you get a small stream of medicine that rarely if ever produces euphoria and will produce a far less activated reward center of your brain.  Approved by the FDA in 2007.

* Daytrana, a methylphenidate skin patch.  Methylphenidate is the same active ingredient in Ritalin and Concerta. The transdermal skin patch formulation is methylphenidate in a form that does not get you high and you can't smoke or inhale a skin patch.  This is why we give smokers nicotine patches to help them quit smoking, the patch is the same active ingredient as cigarettes but the delivery mechanism is so slow it does not activate the pleasure centers of the brain and thus you can treat the withdrawal but not create a positive memory and give you times to rewrite your brain.  Approved by the FDA in 2006.

While Effexor has been shown effective in a couple studies (key word a couple) all the other drugs I listed have far more scientific evidence they work.  I am talking like an order of magnitude more studies 10x for most of those drugs, and some of them 100x more studies.

Explain that you do not want to get high, and you agree that your doctor should not prescribe you any medications he feels uncomfortable in prescribing.  Explain you do not think you are going to abuse again, but you agree if the option is not on the table due to a non stimulant ADHD med or an ADHD stimulant that can't be abused you want to go with one of those.

If your doctor still does not feel comfortable for he does not know these medications as well as he should, thank the doctor for his time and say he is a great doctor but can you recommend me to an ADHD specialist.  I am still suffering a lot of problems in my life such as problems with school and problems with home and cleaning. I am not trying to doctor shop, I am just trying to get treatment to help me with my impairments that are messing up my life.  If the doctor refers you to another doctor than you are not doctor shopping.  Doctor shopping is when you try to do things behind each other back.

And if your doctor will not refer you, then you need to find another doctor.  Contact your drug counselor they can refer you to another doctor and they can do written documentation on the reason why you are seeking another doctor.  Your medical records belong to you and not the doctor so after you have made the doctor's appointment with the other doctor you can have your medical records sent over to the other doctor and they have to do this by federal law.","cm0nphg",3,1415822119,"2014-11-12 19:55:19"

"5258","I know there are a lot of people on here writing their experiences, but I just feel like I have to, too. This is me to a T.

I was diagnosed as an adult. I wasn’t hyperactive and I did fine in school, so they didn’t consider it the root cause of my issues with anxiety and depression (my brother, on the other hand, was diagnosed with ADHD.) I was a procrastinator as a kid, too, struggling with perfectionism, but I figured out a way to manage it by focusing on short-term, achievable goals, like study enough pass X-test or write a paper to pass Y-class. It helped me beat back the perfectionist beast I was always fighting in my head. It was like a video game that allowed me to “level up” to the next school year.

Then adulthood hit and I have been drowning these last few years. At first, I found a job in my dream industry and I was able to “level up” just like I did at school. But then I got a workplace bully. She is the meanest person I’ve ever met. She constantly hounded me for my work, nitpicking every mistake and detail. Criticizing my ideas, my choices, my writing (which was the one thing I thought I was good at - until I met her). She was too high up in the food chain so my complaints fell on deaf ears. I didn’t want to leave the job, because it meant leaving my dream industry and no guarantee I’d get hired elsewhere, but I was miserable. I developed coping mechanisms to get better, to avoid giving her any excuses to bully me. 

It was like she was perfectionist beast in my head come to life. She said all the worst things to me that I already heard from that beast, every day. The beast kept saying, “Just let me handle this - I will shut her up,” and finally, exhausted, I assumed both of them were right - I am a failure who needs to be perfect to be worthy of success. And I let the beast take over. 

For a while, it worked. I learned coping mechanisms, organizational skills I never had until this job - since one of her favorite torture tricks was to force me to hand her the paperwork she needed RIGHT THIS SECOND or she’d yell at me for making her job harder, and how to tune people out while working. I created a quiet office space for myself. It actually made me better at my job. I got promoted four times in seven years. I became the youngest supervisor in the company. Eventually, I no longer had to answer to her, but the damage was done. In my head, the beast has taken on her voice, ridiculing me for my ineptitude, every day. 

Then, when we moved into an open-concept office last year, it broke me. The quiet space I created for myself was gone, and I could no longer keep up with that workload in a loud, busy environment. It nearly destroyed my friendship with my roommate - who I adore - and I started going to therapy. THAT was when I was diagnosed with ADHD and it all made sense. The change in environment meant I was at work for 10 hours a day where I could not get anything done, so I went home to a quiet place and actually worked for 5 or more more hours. I was taking my stress out on my roommate, who was unknowingly breaking my work flow. It was unsustainable. 

I got on medication and started therapy, but what really helped me the most, strangely, has been the pandemic. It’s a tragedy, one I wish never happened because I think the realization I was on a dangerous path would have come to me regardless, but the time away from the office made me realize my perfectionism beast has taken over entirely and has paralyzed me. I lost who I was and what I wanted. I stopped checking in on myself to see if I was okay. If I was happy. If I even liked the idea of being in this industry at all. 

I formally quit two weeks ago. My boss (not the bully, but the her enabler who looked the other way my entire career), said he understood but I’ve heard from several sources he’s furious. I knew he would be, he’s a proud man. I knew I’d be burning a bridge here. But, I’ve also heard “good for you!” More than once. It’s clearly a toxic environment for more than just myself. I am anxious for my future, because I think I’m changing industries entirely. It was never something I’d ever think of doing if I hadn’t been diagnosed and forced to face the perfectionism beast. It’s still there, it’s still mean as hell, but I’m doing my best to quiet it down for good. 

Sorry for the novel, I just had to get it off my chest and send it out into the void. Thank you for your post. It helps to hear I’m not alone.","fv6f25d",1,1592437250,"2020-06-17 23:40:50"

When I say the relief is immediate, I am not exaggerating. It’s crazy how it helps the tension and inflammation on the side of my neck when they work on the back of it, but it’s all connected somehow. 

The interesting thing is that I’ve never even been in a car accident or anything like that. I’m pretty sure it is from spending too much time looking down at my phone, not to mention the tension I have when I am trying to concentrate on the computer screen.

"5265","&gt;I feel like it makes a little more aware of the beauty of life, of all the possibilities there are in the world, all the things to do, the food to eat, the places to travel, the people to help, these ethereal things that make life worth living. Having ADHD is like being just knowledgeable enough to be aware of how much your life sucks, because you have this condition that basically bars you from achieving anything. I never wanted to be rich, to have a huge house or a Ferrari, all I ever wanted was to achieve something scientifically, and to have a nice family life, and it sucks so much to know that I may have the ability but because of ADHD can't really access it, it is like some cruel cosmic joke. 

This hits so close to home..

When I was 10 or 11 or so, they estimated my IQ at 133. I never valued this too much, its just a number after all. But I've always heard from people how intelligent I am, how far I could go in my life *if just*... If I just focussed, if I just put in ""more effort"", if I 'took it more seriously'.

Its so frustrating. 

I am really aware about a lot of things, I experience life very intensely and think a lot. Sometimes its like my mind knows no rest, you know. I truly love life and nature and just everything about the fact that I am here, able to experience the beauty and yet also the tragedy of it all. 

Not long ago, one of my best friends literally died in a motor accident and was reanimated, he's now recovering miraculously well... I've always been a (too) passionate, (too) ambitious person but I always thought ""I have time"", you know? That made me realise I was just lulling myself into a false sense of security to keep myself from panicking. Now that that illusion is gone, my ADHD is so so much more frustrating.

I realize all too well how much I *could* achieve, how precious life really is, and how I want to spend my time to its maximum extent to really develop myself as a person.

And yet.

Its like you said, a joke. Like granting someone the wish of being the fastest man alive, but also giving him the worst condition. So I can sprint very fast and with little effort, just that I need to stop every few minutes to rest...","dvmklx7",2,1520947117,"2018-03-13 13:18:37"

"5267","That is a *huge* amount of amphetamine to be taking daily, and if you're mixing with lots of caffeine as well, you're pretty much created the perfect storm for a big anxiety reaction.

That 70mg Vyvanse is giving you ~21mg of dexamphetamine over time, while that 30mg of MAM (mixed-amphetamine salts) is giving you *another ~17mg* of dexamphetamine, but much faster. And that's not including the levo-amphetamine either.

I would of course recommend mentioning the physical anxiety to your doctor ASAP, but while you wait for your appointment, experiment lowering your dosage on your own to see how it affects you.

Of course first thing is to dump as much of that caffeine intake as possible. Stick to a small cup of coffee or tea in the morning, and that's it. Then experiment with only using the Vyvanse in the morning without the MAM in the afternoon, or try cutting the MAM dose in half for a couple days.

If you're taking the Vyvanse at say 8-9AM, then popping the booster around 2-3PM, that's only 6 hours into the Vyvanse, and you're dumping a big dose of instant release on top of your still reasonably high dexamphetamine levels.","ceuf6la",1,1390247550,"2014-01-20 19:52:30"

My problem is that it's difficult to start. I have to face my fear of failure, worrying about not having enough time to finish, guilt about not having started sooner, etc. So I procrastinate.

Once I do start, I either manage to pep myself up and face my fears, or I feel so much anxiety about the consequences of not doing the thing that it completely drowns the other emotions. It's much easier to continue after starting, at least until something distracts me.

If I know I only have 30 mins or 1h to work on something, it adds more fears and worries. What if I forget where I was at and end up wasting more time figuring that out next time I work? Will it be enough time to make any significant progress, or will I just end up stressing myself out and being less productive tonight when I actually have 4h to work on this? What about the task I am supposed to do after this short time, am I prepared enough for it or should I be doing something regarding that now? etc.

Not sure if this in particular is a symptom, since I know many people with ADHD who are the opposite (find it overwhelming to have to work for hours on something, and need frequent breaks).

I don't have any experience with prenatals, but I personally take a one-a-day vegan multivitamin that has a [whole bunch of stuff in it](http://www.devanutrition.com/vegan-multivitamin-mineral.html). I'm assuming that the prenatal vitamin has B12 in it, but just in case, definitely make sure to be supplementing with B12 and not just eating foods that are fortified with it. Luckily, there's no such thing as a B12 overdose.

There's also this nice [nutritional infographic for vegans](http://imgur.com/CsJ6Z1E), so you can take a look at that for a reminder of what you should be getting (as someone else said, iron deficiencies can also be a source of fatigue) and for some good food sources to add to your diet as well.","d8ns4r5",1,1476215851,"2016-10-11 19:57:31"

I started wearing them on the subway because they give off more of a ""don't talk to me"" vibe than ear buds.

The beeping, the intercoms, people talking loudly, how loud the trains are when you're standing on the platform. I realized I hated the subway so much more when I just used earbuds. Using the noise cancelling headphones allowed me to relax so my commute was less frustrating and exhausting. I had no idea how much the noises affected my mood.

I'm not sure how medication affects it. I have always found certain noises literally rage-inducing - like crawling out of my skin, scream into a pillow, pacing around and doing breathing exercises type rage.

For the most part I only drink coffee in the later part of the day when my meds wear off.  If your meds are working properly there's really no need for caffeine, since caffeine doesn't even come close to giving you the stimulation you get from meds. Trust me, after you start medication you will realize how superior it is, and you will want to keep your heart healthy by not overstimulating yourself with caffeine.

I would ask about nonstimulant options if you want to try those. 

But there is no shame in the medication game. Diabetics need insulin, asthmatics needs inhalers, people with hypertension need blood thinners, we need medication, too. Does it alter our mind? Sure, but so does caffeine and sandwich, the point is to alter it for the better.

Here's how it went for me:

1. Diagnosis: huge relief from knowing many of my issues or shortcomings actually don't have to do with moral failure or lack of character
1. Started meds: Major excitement due to most of my worst symptoms disappearing very quickly
1. A week into meds: slowly became aware of how subtly and perniciously ADHD works in all the million details of my life, especially how it played a major part in my lack of social development and self-confidence
1. About a month in: staggered by how ADHD has somehow affected almost every aspect of my life, and played a part in my worst regrets, and how treatment at an earlier age might have given me enough of a different perspective to avoid some of those horrible mistakes
1. 3-4 months in (now): grateful to have diagnosis and treatment, grateful that I can help my kids live a different life. I see the positive aspects of my much-harder-than-necessary past, mostly that it has made me much stronger and better prepared for hardship in the future, and I can use that to help my kids become more competent, functional, and fulfilled members of society","dwmrzzc",60,1522599817,"2018-04-01 16:23:37"
"5347","I'm going through the process right now, but I'm older than you (mid thirties.) I'll just tell you how it's been going for me so far.

So first I talked to my GP about my ADHD suspicions. She said she couldn't diagnose me and didn't want to prescribe stimulant meds without me seeing one of their ""mental health professionals"" first. So she referred me to one and I had an appointment a couple of weeks later.

When I saw that doctor, they asked me why I was there so I explained why I thought I might have ADHD. He said I would need some psych testing first, but he didn't do that, only a certain type of psychiatrist (or psychologist? I'm not sure) can administer them. Thus I had to make another appointment for *that* doctor, another couple of weeks out. I got to see that guy, and he basically told me, yes I agree you need to take tests, I'll have my office get authorization from your insurance before we proceed so you don't get stuck paying the bill (very expensive.) So that was another 2 weeks of waiting for the appointment to take the actual tests.

When I got to *that* appointment, the tests were just a bunch of multiple choice questions pretty much. Like 500 questions worth altogether or something. Some are probably there to test for other mental illnesses like schizophrenia or bipolar etc, and some were ADHD specific. Now after I took those, I had to make yet another appointment to go back to the second psychiatrist who would give me a Conners CPT 3 test (a short \~15 minutes computer-based test where you watch spot for something other than an X to appear and hit the spacebar. Yes it's that simple) and then go over all the test results and possible diagnosis.

Now all of that being said, it's different for everyone it seems. I've read posts here where people went to their GP and said they thought they had ADHD and their GP just went straight to prescribing Adderal or Vyvanse etc without a second thought. Other people have experiences like mine where you get punted around a lot while various Dr's offices bill your insurance, lol.

tl;dr: it might be super fast and simple, or it might be a bit more long winded. But if you do take some of the common tests, they're just simple ""fill in the bubble that best describes how you feel: strongly disagree, slightly disagree, slightly agree, strongly agree"" or words to that effect. Nothing to stress out over by any stretch of the imagination.","ej6egz9",1,1553320149,"2019-03-23 05:49:09"

My Dr. was especially intrigued by my mom's own written statement of what parenting a child like me was like. Maybe that could help you out... if you can get teacher/school records? 

I'm uninsured right now, but my Psychiatrist will still see me and write prescriptions for Adderall. I just have to pay out of pocket ($150). I wonder if you could pay for an initial meeting, explain the situation, get an official diagnosis, then bring that with you to the Medicaid Dr.?

"5418","IMO, “simply being lazy” and “simply not caring about things” are never simple. I honestly don’t think “lazy” is ever real (maybe unless it means “entitled”). There’s always something else... something about the environment that the person is in that is making it hard or impossible to do the thing, or maybe they have learned to stop trying from a long history of experiencing their efforts as futile.

So yeah, ADHD symptoms look like what people think is “simply being lazy”, but I think that’s just because ADHD is one of the many ways to frequently end up in the situation where you can’t do a thing that seems easy to others.","fjgmluw",1,1583330705,"2020-03-04 14:05:05"

"5420","One of the things that's helped me manage that exact situation (33 years old, about 40k student loan debt from repeatedly trying to go to school like I was ""supposed"" to do, and no degree) is to contact your loan company(s) and apply for an income driven repayment plan. Do not put this off. Do it as soon as your 6 month grace deferment is up if it's not already. 

Further, STOP FEELING ASHAMED. I already did that enough for the both of us before I realized it's not going to help anything. Look at who you are now and where you are now, decide that you're not staying here, you're moving forward. If you don't have a job, find one. Any job. Something that pays. Spend your free time looking for a better job. Rinse and repeat. Doesn't look great on a resume to have tons of jobs in a short time, but right now you're looking for that job that clicks.

"5421","That sucks man. I know that heart-sinking feeling. 

Don't call in sick. Face it head-on. Just explain your side of the story (""totally forgot about it, phone was on silent"") and apologise. I advise against making up an excuse. Even if your boss believes the lie, YOU will know that it was a lie, and you will feel even shittier. Lying is living on borrowed time. 

That's it. You can't do anything else about your boss, or his wife. How they react is their responsibility, and you have very little control over it. 
If there's a strong emotion to their reaction (anger, dissapointment), give it your full attention (""I understand that you're angry/dissapointed""). Don't try to reason or argue at this stage. People eventually calm down, always.  

Also, give room to everything **you** are feeling right now. Yes, it's OK to feel like shit, I know I would. You too will eventually calm down.

You are probably feeling guilty. Thing is, guilt is not an actual emotion. Guilt is a complex combination of thoughts (I shouldn't have done this, I'm so stupid, I'm a failure), emotions (shame, fear), and associated behavior (being apologetic, stressed, or even avoidance). In cognitive behavioral therapy, you would be asked to write down all these thoughts, feelings and behaviors separately, and to challenge the thoughts. 

'I'm such a failure' --&gt; is that statement true? 

* You have failed, but that does not make you a failure as a person. Even an otherwise succesfull person can make mistakes.
* People have trusted you in the past, so you're probably doing some things right. 
* How big is this failure, anyway? Did people get hurt or die? Physical damage? Financial cost? I can think of worse things than forgetting to stream a sports event. It might **feel** like a total and utter failure....but it's not the end of the world.   
* Will you benefit from seeing yourself as a failure in the future? Nope.

We would have deadlines due at midday (submitted online). I would work through the night to get the assignment in, but often write little to nothing until the very, very, very end.

Stress would absolutely peak right before the deadline but pretty much the minute I missed it, like 12:01, I would become all of a sudden way more relaxed.

While still very disappointing in myself for missing the deadline, I knew that there was going to be some way to get it extended... which was very much a blessing and a curse.

I would then secure an extension, then leave the assignment to the very last minute and repeat the above a couple more times. Great fun.","fzull80",1,1596192334,"2020-07-31 10:45:34"

Traveling to places can feel boring too. Or should I just spend time on my profession instead? So many choices. And I usually solve this problem by doing nothing at all and staying idle. I don't like logging in feeling like a chore. 

Instead I spend time roleplaying and socializing and I've had many awesome projects going on with other players. All kinds of events and clubs and such. Some people might think I'm a bit weird for not making progress despite having played for so many hours or that it's a waste of money to not use the actual features of the game, but I feel pretty content as it is!

That choice is not one that will be typically made for someone with ADHD. On top of that, they manage to go to the library and get work done, only stopping for small breaks every once in a while. Quite obviously my point is that this sounds extremely neurotypical as this would typically be very hard for someone suffering from ADHD unless medicated, and it was weird for the parent comment to assert that she likely has ADHD because she said she is struggling to stay focused in the way OP can, for multiple hours straight.

"5468","Experience this a lot, and if I manage nutrition very well, practice being present (usually centered around a theme of being grateful/thankful), and setup my environment for success (some music, sometimes a big board with one task on it right in front of me) it helps.  When you don't have time for this?  Get in predator mode.  You need a predator to chase you sometimes, though I don't recommend using this one full time, you'll turn into a hard ass or a cowering fool probably.  How to remember all this?  Make a list of tactics to motivate yourself, train the habit that before you start something you review this checklist, physically at first then in your mind's eye once it takes hold better.  You have to remind yourself you need this, and you have to accept you need this, then it will get better.  Do not compare yourself to others and how they work or how it should be easier -- comparison is the thief of joy.  Stand strong and do it how you have to do it because that is how you were made and it's not changing.  This will significantly reduce the stress around starting, which is often the biggest problem for us.  The more you practice, the more it becomes part of your character, and that is our holy grail, to be acting out of the principles of our character, not out of the myopic whims of our attention.","cxitz7u",1,1448947366,"2015-12-01 05:22:46"
"5469","I'm very close to my parents, so I'm kinda surprised to find myself in this exact situation. I'm in my mid 20s and still can't get my parents to accept take me seriously (since I do well school/career-wise, they don't see my struggle and think I just want results without doing work). After I finally decided maybe I'm not making this up, and should talk to someone, we had several yelling matches about how they ""won't let me ruin my life with drugs just because my friends convinced me its cool"" (wtf?? I do have a friend with severe depression who is medicated, but I'm not a kid, give me some credit...). Anyways, for what its worth, I decided my parents were unlikely to come around, got separate insurance through my graduate program, and got my diagnosis and an Adderal prescription yesterday. I'm stressed enough dealing with my own feelings and fears about this diagnosis, I don't need them to add to it (event though it really hurts me not to have their support and to have to hide it from them). 

I guess my rambling point is that its ok to make your own decisions and take care of yourself before trying to enlist their support. This might be tricky if you are dependent on them for insurance/financial support, but if you aren't - you're old enough to think for yourself, so do whats right for *you*.","drjhzjk",3,1513807178,"2017-12-20 21:59:38"
"5470","Marie Kondo would ask if it brings you joy, and then say that you must get it.

I would ask: what entertainment would be adult and intellectual? Going to a theater show? A ballet? A symphony? All of those are using technology that's a hundred years behind the state of the art to provide fun. Go buy bleeding edge fun instead! 

And also a switch and a handful of games will entertain you for hundreds of hours, for the same price as two evenings of 'mature' entertainment.

I think if you can articulate what you are afraid will happen if you buy it, the bad thing that would result from being perceived as dumb or childish, you'll find that it might have been true at one time but it probably isn't any more.

Put anything that is ""fun"" outside of your bedroom. Don't have your cellphone in there, don't have our lap top in there, don't have any books, don't have a TV.

"5481","Dude it was super weird. I've been becoming and intentionally putting work into masking less and being a bit more openly 'odd'. Being more open about it means I'm way less anxious - it's kind of funny sometimes - and then that rolls over to my weirdness being just kinda eccentric as opposed to my old style of paranoid and really uncomfortable weird.

Anyway, shops empty but i was looking for something that is kind of sus but for a more legit (but unusual) purpose. She pops out and is like can i help and i didnt feel uncomfortable. And then we had an awesome chat for a bit and like as I left it just sort of rolled off my tongue. And it all ended fine! Emotionally and mentally fine! 

I was and am still kind of blown away at the positive change, it was kind of like an epiphany moment. Usually things come more slowly, though I have been putting a lot of work into my state of mind and between that and the meds things keep improving. 

I've been the same in the past - oblivious, to shy to talk to someone - but also I have had bad attachment issues in the past where I think I started off getting pretty emotionally attached and now I don't really connect to anyone often. So it's nice that side of me might be coming back but in a more 'grown up' way. At least now I can be honest with a potential partner instead of being super reactive and out of control. 

Are you into alternative type thought? I'm talking *some* hippy-type ideas, but also 'big picture' ideas? Existential philosophy, consciousness? This things have been really helpful for me in getting 'outside of my head'. You don't have to believe any of it, but letting it help you understand how little we really know about things is what I like it all for. It's also possible you could find yourself in a dark place with some of the darker philosophy , i guess it is hard to know.

You also have the philosophy of free will, and how the only way for the world to change course is for you to take action. Regardless of where you sit in a sealed room, the rest of the world will go on the one way it ever could (""not true!"" say some people I studied with). I don't believe in free will, and that also takes away some struggle. If I didn't choose to be me, in my situation, and I didn't make any of those choices, then I don't deserve to worry over them. I'm not saying it's ok to be a dick, you support anything you do, but painful ways you behave etc? Not your fault.

I don't know where you are at with your journey but making myself my number one priority and intentionally learning what makes me uncomfortable and reducing its presence in my life has consistently been making things better. I totally recommend it :D the happier we are the more we can give back to the people we really care about and the rest of society.

One of the things about Concerta is that the *way* the time release works is very different.  Most time-release pills work by being designed to dissolve at a specific rate, and unusual stomach chemistry or changes in diet can throw that off.  Concerta uses mechanical pumping powered by osmotic pressure instead.

Because of the differences *and* the observation that the generic did not work as well on me (I did give it a chance!), my doctor was able to get an override on file for me at my insurer, and now I'm back on Concerta.","cvyc3dc",2,1444756841,"2015-10-13 17:20:41"

"5525","Try listening to audiobooks, eventually you will find yourself zoning out from listening and you will be able to turn it off and fall asleep.

Some additional things to try:

1. Keep very consistent waking times, even on weekends. Set an alarm for the same time every day and get up within 5 seconds when it goes off. Put the alarm on the other side of the room if you need to. This might mean that some days you don't get enough sleep, try and stick with it anyway if you can.

2. Remove all sources of light from your bedroom, go for complete darkness if you can. Keep phone use to a minimum when in bed. 

3. You can try low dose Melatonin. 0.3 - 0.5mg is all you need, take it 6 hours before the time you usually fall asleep. This will help to advance your circadian rhythm to an earlier time.

4. Get some sunlight every morning after you get out of bed. You don't need to go outside, sitting in a room with the blinds open all the way should be enough. This will also help to advance your circadian rhythm to an earlier time.

Most important thing to keep in mind is that you can't force yourself to get to sleep. Most likely you will always take longer than most people to fall asleep and you may still have nights where you will lie awake for hours even if you are doing everything perfectly.

The above should help tho if you do it consistently. Also consider keeping a sleep diary, with bed time, sleep and wake times on it so that you can track your progress over time.

Good luck!

"5529","The extended release of Concerta is nice, I don't have to deal with taking more than one pill throughout the day, and the effectiveness is consistent throughout the day. With any of the stimulants though, things to watch out for when figuring dosing/which one out : heart rate, I take 27mg of Concerta, the higher doses give me heart palpitations occasionally, especially if I didn't eat/drink much or had a lot of caffeine. Obviously not good for your heart in the long run. The other big thing that might not be immediately obvious as other side effects is how it affects your appetite. The Concerta definitely surpresses my apetite a bit, so I have to be sure that I'm eating enough. It's especially easy to overlook a meal (or sometimes 2) when I am very busy during school, sitting and hyperfocusing for hours in the library. Another thing to look out for is a little more abstract, but it's how ""zippy"" or wired you feel when taking it, especially when it's first setting in.

"5546","Having been in a relationship where I couldn't remember some of the things my ex was t(/y)elling at me about, it really is a toxic experience. It was confusing and upsetting for me to forget things that were important to her, be they anniversaries or things I'd done or said. What was fucked up and *abusive* was to have these things thrown back at me no matter how many times I tried to apologise, or to be accused of gaslighting when I couldn't remember something or remembered it differently. 

I genuinely hurt her feelings in plenty of ways, and although I hadn't intended to be emotionally damaging it doesn't erase the fact that I fucked up. To this day, I don't know if we simply both remembered things differently and ended up fucking each other up over it unintentionally, but I've come out realising that if someone is going to hold your missing or mismatched memories against you, *you need to get out.*

I get that you can't run (necessarily) away from family though, and I'm not suggesting that your mum is actively trying to be abusive or manipulative. Still, please consider talking with your mother about how confusing it is to have unremembered things thrown back at you continuously. The overall effect of her kind of treatment is that you end up questioning whether or not you can even rely on yourself, and in bad cases end up accepting that everything is your fault, and that you're an objectively terrible person. It blinds you to the real problems in your behaviour or that of others, making it impossible to make any change or progress.

I also reviewed any difficult material with another person. ""You know it when you can teach it."" Without that, studying and review was difficult for me. My parents volunteered for the bulk of it, but I also hired tutors at times, had coffee dates with friends, and probably could have found someone in class to review with. 

Assignments always got cranked out, they weren't an issue for me. 

For people taking classes in person or while you watch videos: Eventually I started doing some needlepoint or a quiet craft in class while listening and writing notes.  It fulfilled the secondary task/focus while still allowing me to listen and take notes. 

At the beginning of the semester, I would write out every task that every class required. At times I used a physical day planner(very satisfying), later an online checklist (satisfying because of the accumulative check offs!). In either system, each class got its own color.

"5578","I mean, I'm not disagreeing with you about the notion that people should see an ADHD specialist if they can (whether that a psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, ADHD coach, etc.). i have also worked in the mental health field and I have seen more referrals for psychological testing for ADHD than for a referral to a psychiatrist. 


I wish I could provide sources for you, but I'm not sure how I would? Some of the information is from my own experiences (myself getting referred to a neurologist, many peers getting diagnosed by their GP, my brother undergoing psychological testing by psychologists and then meeting with their office's psychiatrist, etc.), and some is what I learned in my classes, like in adult psychopathology or clinical skills. 


When I do pass my exams and become a therapist, my focus will be in trauma (which I could make an argument that some effects of trauma could overlap with some symptoms of ADHD, but I digress). But, if a client does express concerns of ADHD, after speaking with them, if it makes sense, I would probably give them either a provisional diagnosis, or a v-code related to attention problems, and refer them to a psychiatrist. Then I would still most likely interweave strategies for ADHD into my treatment with them. 


Anyways, I'm just saying it varies. Maybe its partially a regional thing as well, like if I state has a higher problem of prescription abuse, one may be more likely to be referred to a specialist? I don't know. I live in NJ, commute to school in PA, have worked in MH in Idaho (although my doctor and my brother's doctors were in NV bc of our shitty health insurance). I see my neurologist on Wednesday, I'll ask her why she thinks I was referred to her and not a psychiatrist.

Be patient. Be persistent. I have faith in you, anonymous stranger. 

You are currently dealing with waking up late. OH MAN. Totally an issue of mine. Here's where I'm at with configuring my life around that.

I set an alarm every day and when the alarm goes off, I turn off the alarm and get up and walk across the room no matter how painful it is. Most folks find that shit relatively easy, but for me it took 20 years. And now I'll actually wake up in my living room, not remembering getting there. But I do know when I'm there the next thing is to go to the bathroom and take a shit. I've put a clock in my bathroom so when I sit down to shit, I can calculate how much I have to hurry to get to work on time.

I also have set my alarm to a full hour before I have to walk out the door to get to work on time. And I set the time I have to walk out the door generously, like if the commute to work takes a half hour to 45 minutes, I set my walking-out-the-door time to an hour before work. There are days I'm driving up to work 45 minutes early, and there are days I'm 15 minutes late still. But on the early days, I stop and get donuts for the office, or stop and get breakfast for myself. Late days I just get to the office and try to sneak in. My accomplishment is the late days are now only 10% of my days. And instead of beating myself up about it, I just laugh at myself and think about the hunter gatherer society I was supposed to be born into.

It wasn't until university that it all came tumbling down and even then I still scraped a 2.1 (just, and after the worst and most difficult 3 years of my life).

You ""feel like people with ADHD should have struggled with key stage 1 &amp; 2"", that's just your feeling.

I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid but wasn't medicated for a long time and things got unbelievably out of control as an adult but my doctor refused to treat me for it because I was an adult and he was poorly informed and he instead treated me for all sorts of other issues that I didn't have. Thankfully I was able to find a new doctor that knew what they were doing. It did take me a long time to work back out of the negative situation I'd gotten myself into but I did eventually get there and I hope you will too. Just try to keep looking until you find what works for you and go find some professional help if you can even if you don't think it'll help. You may end up with better providers than what you had before or maybe the available providers will have learned and grown in their field and can do a better job than they previously did. You may look into some sort of caseworker or social service assistance even if not through the hospital to see if you can get some more locally precise guidance on your options for housing and employment. Maybe you can find some sort of contracted work online that lets you accept tasks at a comfortable pace or use a skill or hobby you're already good at or don't know you're good at yet","gth9ekc",1,1617646149,"2021-04-05 18:09:09"

One of the techniques that you can use to direct a client is reflection/ summary. Whenever the client says something I am supposed to reflect their words to them. I find if I am not fast enough I forget all the words they said. I know the gist of the conversation but have a difficult time repeating it back to the client.

My point would be to trust in your intuition. If nothing else you have done has worked, thats not for a lack of trying. There may be a chance that your brain is phsyically incapable of performing what you want it to. In this case, youre making the right choice.

Think about it this way. So many people live without ever finding out the reason behind their behaviors. Even in the slim chance that you dont have ADHD, youre still one step closer to the truth. Edison failed a thousand times before he found something that changed the world. Would it be worth it to give it a shot to change yours? Nothing happens if you dont try.

"5640","For me your question is a little ambiguous. But I'll answer what I think you are asking, in the best way I can.

I am 53, I was diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago, a month before my 11 year old son.

It changed my life. But most significantly, it changed mint and my wife's whole approach to our son, having struggled to understand for many years.

Everyone is different. My son is exceptionally intelligent, but not focused enough to be classed as gifted. As parents our job in life now is to support him in whatever he is passionate about. Protect him, and make sure he understands come thing in life...he will never be able to adequately manage his own affairs....he shouldn't even try...he should get someone else to do that... he should focus on his talents, what he is good at and what he most enjoys.... Pay someone else to do his taxes, financial planning, life planning.

But as far as learning colors... Since we don't have that kind of problem...I might humbly suggest they you don't sweat it. Again, focus on the things that he is interested in.

(15 minutes ago, I asked my son to go downstairs and get me  a glass of water and  2 of my Foqest from the bottle on the kitchen table....15 mins later, he came back with 1 tablet, no glad of water.... That's my Boy... But I smile thank him, and ask him to complete the treat is the task).

So...Love your son. I am sure that you do, but tell him that,  every minute they you can. Support him, and don't sweat about learning.

"5644","I was recently diagnosed at 64 yrs so I can't be angry at the school system because ADHD was unknown then. The first thing I did after being diagnosed was to pull out my old report cards and reread the comments and look at the check marks for bad conduct. It was amazing how obvious it was in retrospect. What pisses me off is that I had a lot of therapy over the years and the now obvious signs of ADHD were attributed to depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc from being raised by messed up parents and the bad situations I got myself into later. I took those report cards into some of those therapy sessions and told them that I felt that I was a lot smarter than my achievement levels indicated. Even today, knowledge of ADHD in the general public is very low. 

I should reread those report cards again, now that I have 3 months worth of learning about ADHD.

"5660","I am by no means a medical professional, and I'm brand new to this subreddit (and to the revelation that I have ADHD) but my mother and a close cousin both suffered from different seizure disorders for quite a few years.

My cousin always remembered her seizures unless she was unconscious, but my mother would completely forget hers. Her seizures take place in her frontal lobe and sometimes simple-partial seizures (not the kind where she is convulsing, but stays upright and even talking) will give her intense feelings of ""deja vu"" where she is flooded with memories - but then afterwards she can't remember them.

I have had panic attacks quite a few times before, and her description of the physical symptoms of small seizures sounded so similar to my panic attacks that when I first had one, I thought it WAS a seizure (it wasn't).

She is epileptic, so she has to be on medication for that permanently, but its stabilized now and she no longer has seizures of any kind. She also does not have ADHD that I'm aware of.

I would just keep your neurologist informed of everything you experience, whether it seems related to the panic or seizures or totally unrelated - it might be a clear connection for a professional.

I was only diagnosed this year, but I've made some pretty good progress with a combination of medication, Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. I focus on my physical health and nutrition and exercise. I find that I have to supplement my deficient executive functions with A LOT of external ""cheats"": checklists, smartphone timers, memory cues, habits, you name it.

Also, I decided to be open and talk to my friends and family about ADHD, and I was shocked at the number of people whom I know that have it, too. They all have been a wonderful source of information and support.

Everyone's symptoms are different, so you just need to experiment to see what works for you. Since you're at school, please look into disability accommodations; I'm considered gifted too, but I still need certain things in order to function.

They also have had articles for Vayarin (a medical food that is now no longer sold in the US because its research was bunk) that suspiciously looked like stealth advertisements (which is highly unethical and illegal in the US).

We also find it problematic that their medical review panel includes not only legitimate doctors and psychologists, but also (at the time of writing) one practitioner of integrative medicine, which combines legit medical practice with pseudoscience and alternative medicine.

i think the important thing is that you let your pdoc know you really would like to try them to help get your adhd behaviors in hand.  and i think what you said about straterra not doing anything for motivation is enough that your pdoc would talk to your mom if you asked him to. you have been diagnosed adhd and stimulants are a very good treatment for it. your mother has an unfounded fear probably from misinformation and little education regarding the subject, and you know i understand that, but you wanting to try a stimulant doesn't mean you are or will become an abuser. what if you asked your pdoc to get info for her and talk to her?

"5716","Excitotoxicity is the primary source of brain damage in most forms of amphetamine abuse, with the over-expression of various neurotransmitters leading to this damage. Specifically, I am discussing dextro and levo amphetamines, the only amphetamines the average ADHD sufferer will receive that could lead to this kind of neurotoxicity with overdose. Excitotoxicity comes about when an overabundance of various neurotransmitters leads to overstimulation of neurons, and as a result neural death. Glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter in the brain, and it is also toxic at high concentrations. [Source](http://neurotransporter.org/glutamate.html). d-amphetamines primarily releases glutamate in the brain [Source] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9266771).

&amp;nbsp;

I only mentioned benzodiazepines for breakthrough anxiety. As I stated, SSRI’s are effective for general low level anxiety. Breakthrough anxiety, is a severe short term period of anxiety that is not ameliorated by the SSRI treatment. According to the scientific literature, benzodiazepines are a very effective and safe option for this kind of anxiety. [Source] (http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-01016-006). Also, whether a substance is considered “controlled” by our government or any other, is irrelevant to it’s efficacy in treatment, and the controlled nature of a substance also doesn’t necessarily represent intrinsic risk. I give marijuana as a prime example of this.

&amp;nbsp;

Tennex is not dangerous for the vast majority of the populace, in fact, it is safer than clonidine, as far as abrupt cessation is concerned. The fear of abrupt cessation has been overblown, specifically on this sub, as well as other subs.  Abrupt cessation does not lead to hypertensive crisis in an average individual, even when amphetamines are included. This paper discussed patients *who are already hypertensive* meaning they are already in the at risk group. No deaths occurred with either clonidine or tenex, and tennex was considered safer than clonidine when considering abrupt cessation.[Source] (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000291498690723X).  

&amp;nbsp;

Do I even need to tell people, that if they are already hypertensive, that maybe they should avoid amphetamine use while simultaneously abruptly stopping their blood pressure medications?

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, I made no claim, that a lack of adhd medication efficacy demonstrated a comorbidity. However, comorbid disorders are incredibly common with the diagnosis of ADHD. [Source](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.4.716). As a result, it is certainly important to realize, that if you have ADHD, and you are having serious anxiety or depression symptoms, that this very well could be due to comorbid depression or anxiety disorders.","dg8ss9f",1,1492146856,"2017-04-14 05:14:16"
"5717","I don't get where they'd compare the comedown from meds with a life of managing ADHD symptoms. If I had of taken meds in my 20's and not my 30's, I probably wouldn't be on ssri's, too. I would have a much more stable life and probably enough success that I wasn't relying on family and government for so much. 

There's definitely an agenda against people who want to take stimulants for ADHD rather than cope through exercise, but it's very class orientated, and a lot of cases would appear as a form of systemic racism. The effort someone has to go through to get stimulants is insane, and there's no doubt in my mind this is not a concern that gets any attention in academia or from doctors. There's only a manic marketplace driven focus from both to praise new drugs or denounce some for their side-effects. 

I wouldn't find a new psychiatrist, I'd make my case for balancing the come don against the effect on my mood that adhd has and then reiterate that point endlessly for whatever trials they wanted to put me through. I'd also voice my concern that I'm thinking that their solutions are not responsible and that I was considering other advice but that I'd like for them to state clearly what was their concern for me in particular. 

If they want to test pilot a new treatment, then tell them to find a new patient and that you'd like to do what has been effective for people that you know. Don't be rude, just be blunt. Doctors treat people as much from attitude as from common sense, so don't try to argue with their points about treatment, just try to let them give you the responsibility of the choice to go either route.","fapcslk",1,1576285648,"2019-12-14 01:07:28"

Side note: she has 3 daughters. One of them I've never met. Daughter 1 worked with us when I started 3.5 years ago, she was assistant manager and late all the time, she left for another job 1.5 or 2 years ago.

Secondly, a lot of people are bad conversationalists.  Here is the secret.  Having a good conversation with people is **40% talking, 60% listening**, along with things like reflection -- repeating what they've said, paraphrased, asking if you understand it correctly, and then maybe even leaving it at that.  Impulsivity is a huge part of ADHD and related personality issues and it can be a challenge to not ramble for some, but I promise you less words can be more, and people really appreciate just being heard, even if you're bored by what they're saying, let them say it (unless they're being offensive or something, then speak up).

You are so quick to believe that your ADHD is responsible for every failure in your life. Fight through it, take responsibility for yourself as a human being and stop using ADHD as an excuse. It definitely impairs focus and attention, but if you try to overcome it, you will see that nothing is written in stone. Regardless of what your beliefs are, you have established that you have given up faith.

If you send a disgruntled letter then they will right you off as someone with a deep desire to have ADHD that doesn't have it.

If you write a letter asking politely for their full rational and provide evidence backed counter points to the information that you have received thus far then, either they will learn from their mistake or they will provide you with a  more comprehensive explanation of why *you* don't meet criteria.

That's the best move if you genuinely believe that they got it wrong and don't want them hurting someone else.

Someone might take Adderall and feel great and get a lot of work done for hours. Someone else might take the same amount and feel anxious and jittery and depressed.

Just start with something basic like Adderall, Ritalin, or Concerta, and keep trying new medicines until you find the one that works the best for you.","c86iqqx",6,1359585025,"2013-01-30 22:30:25"

4) this is very niche, but I’m a developer and there’s an API for Asana that I’ve in the past used to automate giving myself daily recurring tasks (brush teeth, log meals in my fitness pal, exercise, journal etc)

5) it’s accessible anywhere with a device and internet connection (mobile app and desktop website). It also integrates with Siri I think but I don’t use that much

"5848","I've been deeply depressed where I felt worthless and that was all I'd ever be, that everything I touched would turn to--to put it politely--ash.  One thing I read recently that helped me understand why some of my attempts didn't work out in the past was that your self-image has to match whatever motivational/positive things you are saying to yourself.  I never truly believed until recently that I could do and be better, that I had any control over things.  Listening to motivational podcasts and reading motivational material helped me slowly start believing, and when I started doing things too, I started to see some results.  That's because my self-image starting to improve.  

One of the books I turn to while depressed and worrying is Dale Carnegie's book on Worrying (How to Stop Worrying and Start Living).  

Two pieces of advice from that book that really stuck with me and help me when I recall them:

1 - Live in day-tight compartments.  A lot of my stress and worry came from worrying about the future, if what I was or wasn't doing now or was doing poorly or failing to do would ruin my chances for whatever in the future.  It suggested ""the load of tomorrow, added to that of yesterday, carried today, makes the strongest falter.""  The advice was to do the best possible work you can today and that is how you prepare for tomorrow.  When I was depressed and feeling a failure, it helped to narrow the focus down as much as possible.  What can you do now.  Focus on it.  Then work what you can do next.  And so on.

2 - The next bit of advice was to ask, What is the worst that can happen?  Next, was to accept that outcome mentally (if necessary) and ask, What happens next?  The final step was to improve on the worst.  Step two helps you get to the point where you can think clearly, and think solutions.  The last step is a way to help you regain some control.  Before reading this advice, I was always logjammed at what was the worst that could happen.  Thinking through the next two steps helps me release some of the worry and stress; it helps me to start getting a better idea of what may happen and what I can do about it.  Sometimes you realize it's not as bad as you think, too!

Finally, I work at a college.  I see people of all ages at all stages in their career ambitions coming in.  You have a chance at any point in time to get what you want out of life--it's not just now, and not just ""perfectly done well"" now.  It's not ""all or nothing"" now.

This can't replace professional services to help with depression, but finding your own ways to try to regain control over some of your fears can't help but help.","cwtn877",1,1447038167,"2015-11-09 03:02:47"

I have been taking this mix for well over a year now and my ADHD symptoms seem greatly diminished. Then again it may not work for you, my wife does not seem to have the same results, then again she is more on the ADD side of things than the ADHD. ","cm4xs6p",2,1416229869,"2014-11-17 13:11:09"

"5857","I like to think of my smartphone as my prosthetic brain. I've come to realize that my memory is terrible, and being able to stick to a plan, and to schedule, are not exactly in my talk it. But I have a smartphone, and it lets me stay on track, it gives me something to take notes on before they fall out of my brain, I can pay bills , transfer money,  check my accounts,  and other things that normal people do with mail that I won't handle, because I just can't handle paper at all. I have reminders, a calendar, I can open my files on my phone, if I have a thought for something in a paper I'm going to need to write for school, I can just open up the file I can use speakerphone to dictate my thoughts as well. I think sometimes I would lose my thoughts in the amount of time it would take for my brain to make words come out either hand writing or typing. I can't even tell you the shape I was in before smartphones were thing.

My suggestion is uninstall anything that you know is a time-waster for you. Almost everything has a web version to it, which often for me is slow enough that it'll make me think twice before going on it. For example, there's a Reddit app, but I don't have it in my phone. If I really need to ask something on Reddit, I can use Chrome to get there. But it takes longer and it's more annoying, so I don't do it as often.","g483r0d",1,1599394637,"2020-09-06 12:17:17"

"5867","In my experience, it doesn't just fail to assist in transitions...sometimes it actively works against them. 

Most of the time, I just have to manually force myself to make a transition...but sometimes vyvanse helps me to focus by being engrossed in what I'm doing...and this focus is so intense that it's a kind of hyper-focus. My natural ADHD hyper-focus just feels like tunnel-vision, wherein I don't want to shift tasks because I'm interested in what I'm doing and everything else seems boring. Vyvanse hyper focus is more like being mentally shackled to a task. As in, I MUST keep doing this thing, because THAT IS WHAT I DO. 

It's a shame, because transitions are one of the things that I struggle with most...but it's the price to pay for smoothness, I suppose. Other stimulants make me anxious, irritable and sketchy, so I just try to work with vyvanse as best I can.","cze4078",1,1453919216,"2016-01-27 18:26:56"

"5871","Your argument is speaking to a context which was not presented in the OP.

The reason your point is secondary to the OP is due to it being a schedule II drug. His concerns are that drug abuse (defined here as taking the drug as otherwise prescribed as a doctor) lead to situations where those with the need can have a harder time obtaining the medicine that they benefit from. Because it's illegal, and unsupervised application is more likely to lead to addiction and harmful effects, higher the abuse rates will encourage law makers to regulate the drug even more.

They are no more entitled to stimulants over someone without a script than someone with a broken leg is entitled to an electric scooter over an obese individual. This argument in and of itself doesn't seem to carry any relevant point though. 

How does entitlement relate to a process of legislation which increases the barriers by which people obtain their medicine? You are presenting an ideal isolated from real world application.  If you are going to respond in criticism, at least offer an argument which refutes the idea that people  with scripts face more difficulties in obtaining medication when people who don't have scripts are taking them at higher rates.

But after letting myself down over and over and over again, culminating in failing some fairly easy classes despite all of my best intentions, I got help for it. And the moment I was on medication, everything made sense. 

The thing about medication is that it doesn't give you any of the work ethic or skills you're supposed to have been developing over time. It just gives you the capability to properly cultivate those skills. I can't really fully explain it, but I can be lazy and unproductive on my meds, but it feels like a choice to be lazy, as opposed to when I'm not on my meds and can't get my work done no matter my best intentions. As an example, I still had to build the habit of meditating and exercising everyday, but it felt doable. Meditation and exercise still feel like a chore, but I get them done. But when I take a couple of weeks off my meds, even if I had weeks of daily positive habits in place, even getting myself to meditate for a minute and make my way to the gym feels like a monumental task.

The amount of people I meet on a daily basis who suffered from or ""enjoyed"" the symptoms associated with ADHD,  and who were never diagnosed, is through the roof out here.  

Most of them suck at math or lacked the discipline required for the rigors of a structured or limiting academic requirement.  However, those who have succeeded was either through their artistic and creative drives or the ability to socialize and secure friendships that helped them climb the social ladder.  

Which doesnt surprise me since more and more studies are showing that creativity, and the hyperfocus needed to excel in these creative pursuits is seen more and more in people diagnosed with ADHD.

The flipside is that our senses tend to be also magnified compared to the general population. Taste,  touch,  sex,  food,  experiences,  and substances are also felt more as a result.  Leading many toward falling into the abyss of addiction.  It's why the Sunset Strip is a loud,  pulsating light show,  while also providing the temptation of excess.  
Maybe ADHDers were better suited to travel the world,  before borders, before limitations, aided and motivated by new tastes,  new sensations,  new partners.

You might have some luck comparing yourself to other kids in your class. Explain how you're different to the lazy ones. Explain what prevents you from being like the big achievers. Don't let the matter rest. Make it clear to your parents that **you aren't looking for an excuse** - tell them about all the things you wish you could do, that you've tried to do, but couldn't. Tell them how much hope this gives you for the future. Your dad could be your biggest ally. Make it clear to him that you're struggling in all the ways he struggled. He's a smart man - ask him what it would take to convince him you might have ADHD. If he admits there isn't anything, you can at least show that he isn't being reasonable and ask him why the idea upsets him.

This last part may seem a little manipulative, but it's also the most effective. Ask them why they would rather believe that there is something *morally* wrong with you, rather than medically wrong. They're your parents, chances are they care about you a lot. Once they've accepted that you know something is wrong, that it  *isn't* normal to be like this, that you want to change, you're 99% of the way there.

When I started Adderall things became a lot better, because I was able to keep up with school. I actually ended up leaving my psychiatrist because it was so obvious that SSRIs were not working. Not sure if there was a point where I was on both.

What I can say though is that Effexor has been wonderful for me. I take 225mg, and I increased my dose very gradually over the last 2 years. I find it works quite well in conjunction with Adderall for my ADHD symptoms.

If you think you may be bipolar, be very careful with both SNRIs and stimulants. A side effect of SNRIs is increased vulnerability to mania. I take 50mg of Seroquel at night as a mood stabilizer to manage it, but even then I do have bad weeks where I have go off Adderall altogether or I'll go nuts. Mania and psychosis are very scary and I would definitely make sure to check in with your doctor frequently when you start. That said, Effexor has done wonders for my depressive episodes.

"5938","I can only speak about myself in this regard.  Yes, for me, adhd has caused some physical issues as a result.  

Those issues I didn't ever previously associate as being a result of adhd, until I was medicated and in therapy.

When on medication, it's like my mind woke up.  This last time on medication and in therapy I've been taking it seriously and as a result been at it a while.

Anyway, when I first started it was as though my mind 'woke up' but also my body.  I seemed to want to fidget more and my body wanted to move.   At night I would wake up sleepless and need to move, my body, my arm, my leg whatever needed to move.  Just like when i was a kid.  I thought the medication was doing it, during the day medication was helping my attentiveness, but was making me fidget and restless at night.

I was like that as a child (not medicated), but had learned to ignore it most of the time.  I would ignore when I was hungry, when my arm fell asleep, when my leg hurt sitting in a position for a long time.  I would ignore it until the limb fell asleep and sometimes a little after, I'd ignore hunger past pain until i was going to pass out.

I didn't realize it at first, but on medication I was simply noticing my body.  My body wanted to move, not because I'm adhd, my body wanted to move because I would never move it.  I didn't actually want to fidget, I just wanted to stretch, i wanted to not stand and sit how i was.

I had reported other 'side effects of medication' tingling in my fingers, pain in my arm pit shooting to my fingers as well as fatigue.  I also blamed medication for worse tinnitus.

One of these sleepless nights I noticed my back.  I knew i was getting older but I never realized how bad my posture had gotten over the years.  My back making multiple curves and my shoulders far far forward.  Then I remembered that my height measured at the doctors office being a full inch off from my early adulthood probably wasn't some measurement error.

So i started paying more attention and trying to stand straight etc.  The tingling, aching, etc is all from years of slouching.  How I walk, how I stand, how i reach for things, how i do dishes, how i type... All of this I started to notice on medication.  All of it I do it in a way that strains tendons and disrupts the nerves passing through my arm.  When I sleep, sometimes I cut off circulation or pinch a nerve, waking up with a numb leg or arm.

I guess you didn't need that full story.  TLDR: health issues from neglect are legitimate concerns with adhd; what seems like side effects of medication sometimes is simply now one notices previous issues.  (tinnitus, oral health, posture, eating habits etc)

For things like compulsive masturbation, which a lot of people might feel uncomfortable talking to a therapist about, maybe self-administered CBT and mindful practices is overall more helpful for some individuals.

You also tend to miss a lot of details because of attentional and memory issues.

Basically, why would the rich and powerful care about your education?
It used to be the case that when the usa was a manufacturing economy it needed workers who were educated. Now since all the manufacturing is done in China it needs Chinese people to be educated and does not really give much of a rats ass about usa workers. Only the manufacturing is done in China, the factories are still owned by usa so most of the profits still go there.

Basically to make things better you need to do one of 3 things get money out of politics or stop free trade or become part of the system by become rich. Sadly you cant do the first 2 without the 3rd; and once you do the 3rd its unlikely you will still want to to the 1st and 2nd as you now are giving the education your kids deserve because of the the 1st and 2nd problem.

(Also, you have not tried the non-stimulant guanfacine or clonidine, which can help with anxiety too. But a lot of docs will treat anxiety with front0line anxiety meds before writing for any ADHD meds, so you may well get a lot of benefit from the new anxiety prescription. ADHD and anxiety are hard to tell apart sometimes, and they can overlap and make each other worse.)

It's gonna take one step at a time, but I remember the desperation to be better NOW because you've been looking forward to treatment so much and are so unhappy. Just please don't lose hope. Keep going back until you find relief. 

You may also want to try the usual non-prescription things that are proven to help if you haven't given them a regular serious go already -- exercise, maybe omega-3s, maybe yoga or meditation.

"5965","Adderall IR 20mg twice to thrice a day have worked wonders with me. Also vallium 10mg 2-3 times a day added to the mix helps to keep a stable clear state throughout the day, evening and into going to sleep at bedtime.  Having ADHD or ADD is not about if your dose is to high or low,  it is really about how much dopamine is your brain not making and how much does your genetics tell your brain you need.  Find that right dose and you are golden. Because it is all about the dopamine in all of our cases.  Take a brain image of a ADD or ADHD patient not on stimulants and put it next to a image of a normal person and the ADD brain does not even look human,  give that same person a stimulant medicine and boom withing 2-4 hours the images look almost the same,  or should I say normal.  The release of dopamine cause our brains to fire at the right speed.  Basically as a doc would say,  speed you up to slow you down to normal. But only so much stimulants can be taken before you endanger your organs. If you have taken say 20-30mg of say adderall twice or thrice a day for several months straight and feel it is becoming less effective, take days off taking only half of one tablet when you do not really need your brain to be that normal state well all like to call home 1-2 days a week and you can basically stay on the same dose for decades I would imagine.  Until they find a cure for the root of the disorder stimulants are the only temp cure.  Any good doctor knows this and science has proven it with physical evidence time and time again.  When people joke about ADD and ADHD being made up,  remember,  your brain is different,  you were born different and fuck those assholes,  if they cannot do the research to learn the truth why do they matter.

One, regardless of the meds you'll be prescribed, they're going to have a varying, but noticeable, effect on your behavior and mood. This is *especially* true when dialing in a new dosage or changing meds. Also, depending on the type of med, come up and comedown can cause massive issues with your focus and mood

Two, you have an actual diagnosed mental disability. Now that you know you have it, you can seek tools and workflows better suited to your brain.

My boss understands now that if I sit for too long staring at spreadsheets and code, my brain fizzles out and I lose productivity.

A HW should let you petition to have those classes taken off your record due to family tragedies or physical/mental ""debilitation.""

If it's approved, it should erase those classes from your record and from your GPA, then you can just re-take them.

"6017","Yes, and that's what I mean when I say the support he needs isn't necessarily in joining his likely pointless endeavour of a delusional.

The leashing out I know from earlier. I now see that I was actually angry at my own inability when people pointed it our (even if meant helpfully), and responding aggressively was a subconscious tactic to make them stop, so that I would have to be angry and disappointed about myself less often. I'd wager the guess that he in fact knows that this business is doomed deep inside, but he's not ready to admit it.

Maybe your support could be to somehow guide him to recognise this -- without blocking our first in an aggressive manner. (no, I don't have a magic recipe how to. I don't know your husband).

As for myself, for me it was very long unthinkable that ""there was something wrong with me"" at all. So I would be dismissive or aggressive if people suggested professional help. However, your husband **is** diagnosed, so he might be a huge step ahead of me back then. Did he accept the diagnosis truly? Is he currently medicated? Does he see a coach or therapist? If not, making these happen could be the first steps.

I can certainly see your stubborn husband just doing what he feels he had to do despite your very well founded (and as it turned out, true) warnings. That could have been me some time ago, in fact, I have done similar things despite my family contrary advice. It's more a coincidence and luck that this was before I had my family of my own.

BUT! -- and that's the take-away -- people **can** definitely change radically in their adulthood (which does not mean that everybody can). (but it's not easy and is a slow process). In several aspects I did. But this is certainly only possible with external help **and** it is not a question of volition alone. It is to a great extent governed by external forces, chance and the individual's past, so don't make the mistake of ""if you really love me you *can* do this or that"" -- that's just a variation of the bane of ADHDers ""you just have to want to / you just have to try harder / you just have to focus"".

Vyvanse lasts 8 hrs or so-so focus but adderall xr gives me 4.5 hours of excellent focus. So I just get my work done in a shorter period of time instead.

I can also be funny, but find it helps me tone things down when I need to focus and listen better to others. Everybody is different.

"6027","Interesting way to look at it.

Honestly short-term motivation is the killer. Long term I want to be someone totally different, you know, successful and independant, with a degree and *career*, all that jazz. But that's *really* long-term. Med-term comes first because going back to school when I can't even work out how to eat properly or wake up on time seems like a stupid idea. So med-term involves establishing a basic routine and focusing on my health a bit more.

The planning and prepping thing is what I'm stuck on. You have an excellent point. I have so much I need to change in order to get to that med-term goal that I get stuck starting.. and have been stuck here for a very long time. Everything I think about doing can always be done ""tomorrow"". The desire is there but there's absolutely no desire to start *now*, like one more day won't hurt... and repeat, all year.

I'm not sure what you mean about ""just do"". This is the part where breaking down goals into tiny little goals is key, I think? I've always struggled with that one, like even if I succeed at a bunch of tiny goals, the bigger picture is still in total shambles and it all falls apart. Which is really a stupid mindset to be in considering I can't really do much to make things worse, at this point.

2) Do other things! I'll often have well over ten things that need to be done around the house. When I get a few of these things done which causes me to feel like I am in control again and also happiness just to have a smaller 'to do' list.

"6080","Hi there. Completely understand as my SO and I are both working from home right now, and our dog likes to come up to my desk for pets (I love him dearly, but it's very distracting). My SO is understanding and doesn't intentionally interrupt me, but even seeing her walk to the kitchen to make tea out of the corner of my eye breaks my focus.

If you have tried to get your SO/parents to understand by verbally explaining and it hasn't worked, I would recommend abandoning this strategy. For one reason or another, this approach just doesn't work on some people.

I bought a [room divider](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A7YV51C) which goes up in the morning as soon as I start work. It blocks out my peripheral vision of the rest of the apartment and blocks our dog from coming up to me. This has been a gamechanger for my productivity. The one I linked in particular is light enough that you could carry it with you from your place to your parents'.

I would also suggest purchasing some noise-cancelling headphones. If you don't want to drop $300+ on a brand like Bose, you can find less expensive brands that may not have the same sound quality, but certainly do block out noise ([these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075CBHN9M) are $50, for example).

Move your work desk(s) against the wall, put the room divider up behind you, and put on your headphones. If that doesn't send a clear enough message and someone still tries to get your attention, simply ignore them - even if you have to sit and stare at your computer screen doing nothing for a couple minutes - until they go away. This may be extremely frustrating the first time you do it, but they should get the message. If they still don't, then honestly, just get a new husband/family lmao. No one who continues to intentionally damage your mental health even after you've made your needs and boundaries explicitly clear is worth keeping in your life.

Over time, the social/mental effects on my son were heavier than the perceived medication risks.  Please read about Vyvance.

"6169","Human Beings have 3 different types of memory, with different purposes with how long the data should be retained.

**#1** Short Term Memory.  This length your brain can store this data is measured in seconds at most a minute.  You can refresh your short term memory by reabsorbing the short term memory from your environment (such as looking at the words again or asking someone to repeat something.)

* **Purpose:** To be a temporary vessel while your brain analyzes the data to see if it has any emotional relevance or where the brain can ""combine"" or ""organize"" the data so it can be stored in the next.  This information has no ""connection"" no ""relevance"" it is just *info*, *it is not* **information** for the info is not in an useful form.

**#2** Working Memory, sometimes called **Working Attention** to help people understand the difference between the similar english word short term memory.

 * **Purpose:** This is where you brain stores short term data *that is useful*.  This memory can last minutes, hours, and sometimes days.  Your brain takes short term memory that has emotional significance and stores it into working memory.  **Working memory is useful for it allows you to work towards a goal.** Your brain keeps this data constantly being refreshed so you do not forget it.  Your brain forgets this data when it receives too much working memory it can not remember the information, or when something with higher emotional significance takes its place (new goal, or a distraction that you think you should emotionally respond to.). 

**#3** Long Term Memory.  This is what used to be working memory but your brain via the hippocampus has created into a permanent memory.  This memory has many subtypes such as episodic memory (sensory recall), declarative memory (facts and data), and autobiographical memory (stories your brain tells based off the episodic and declarative memories).

 * **Purpose:** To store long term data so you can reuse past experiences (hindsight) to experience a better future (foresight).  Now for this memory to be useful your brain has to be able to adapt these memories in your daily life.

----

ADHD people have problems with #2.  They are usually fine with #1 the Short Term Memory, but with #2 they have various types of problems due to what subtypes of ADHD they have.  Some people are just not good at manipulating data in their head.  Other people can not sustain the working memory it just falls out.  Another group have problems with filtering the data.  Additional ADHD people never turn off their brain autopilot and realize they should be storing this data instead running on habits and instincts.  Some ADHD people have inhibition problems where they get distracted by new information and thus they forget the old information...and so on.  Most ADHD people have multiple of these problems.

And without working memory you can not sustain your motivation and your action towards long term goals.  The purpose of working memory and the frontal lobe is to provide the glue, the support, the structure to make large complicated tasks into smaller tasks and then turn those smaller tasks into the greater goal.

"6177","I think google translate did okay, but it could be better.

I think you need to speak with your doctor about your medication. It sounds like it is not providing enough benefit. You may need to change it to get better. Talking with your doctor about possible changes to your treatment is the best solution for your situation.

Doing recreational drugs to help you with school is only a temporary benefit. It's going to make it impossible to identify how your current ADHD treatment should change to give you better results.

My advice is that you stop doing cocaine, and every other mind altering drugs you're using. Until you can find the right medications and dosages to treat your ADHD, doing anything else is only going to prolong the time it takes to find the best treatment plan. Additionally, if your doctor even thinks for a moment that you're doing cocaine, or any other drug, they may stop prescribing you Concerta. I don't know what country you're in, but many countries have laws that require drug tests to qualify for ADHD medication. Even if you don't have to take drug tests, doctors will modify your treatment if they think you're doing drugs, and that will reduce the qualify of care you receive. It will also have a long lasting negative impact on your healthcare for years. Not just with ADHD, but with everything.

I'm actually supportive of people doing recreational drugs, and I wish they were not illegal. But even with my perspective on drugs, I do think you need to stop doing drugs, and get your ADHD medication figured out. You have the rest of your life to live, and I think it would be a better life if you made getting your ADHD treated effectively the priority. You have the rest of your life to get high, and I don't think it's a big sacrifice if you stopped for a little while. If you think it's a big sacrifice, or think it's something you would be unable to do, then you need to start thinking about it as an addiction, and get help for it ASAP. I will say that I used to drink a lot, and when I finally got my ADHD treated with medication, my desire to drink has nearly vanished. My point is that your ADHD may be part of the reason you are doing cocaine. When you get your ADHD treated, your desire to drugs will possibly go away or reduce.

Another thing. idk if cocaine is really a good drug for adhd. I thought it had the opposite of effect that amphetamines have on dopamine. I don't know how Concerta works, so who knows if it's interfering or not. This is all out of my realm of knowledge, and I don't do recreational drugs, so I could be completely off base. I just thought that cocaine mimicked the chemical reaction of schizophrenia, and that's the opposite of ADHD. My point is that I would never have guessed cocaine would help ADHD symptoms.","dh97sqr",2,1494188237,"2017-05-07 20:17:17"

"6182","Man you are so right, it is the inability to filter out “irrelevant” information. 

Anthropology has this concept of “[categories.](http://era.anthropology.ac.uk/Kinship/classification.html),” I couldn’t really find a good reference for it, sorry!

Our brain separates things into different categories like, animals, tools, friends, art. And our brain thinks of things only in terms of these categories, when you look at a wrench you see it as a tool and not a piece of art (before Warhol, soup was food and Brillo pads were cleaning supplies, never art). 

This is useful in lots of ways but also inhibits creativity and innovation because you only see things for what they have been in the past rather than what else they could be in the future. Warhol’s entire body of work is based on the concept of breaking down these categories and saying soup is art!! And his installations of boxes of Brillo pads sitting on the floor of a museum were revolutionary.

My brain, whether this is due to ADHD or not, doesn’t really stick to pre-conceived categories. I see things in a much fuller context of their potential rather than their established use. And this helps me see all sorts of patterns, and it makes me very creative, but it also makes it very difficult to communicate my ideas to other people.

In a way, it’s like Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. Other people are stuck looking at the shadows, not realizing there is anything else, but I can see the sun too.","gbumseq",1,1605031776,"2020-11-10 18:09:36"

"6216","Honestly I can’t recommend it enough and I really hope you’re able to get help!

I never tried CBT directly (I used methods of CBT and ACT to figure out some coping skills on my own). This has been my process:

**1) ADHD medication.** Helped with motivation, mood consistency, brain fog, self-destructive thinking (hyper-focus).

**2) RSD/Hyperarousal medication.** I feel like a lot of people don’t get help for this step but this has helped my mental health more than anything else. I’m on Guanfacine and it’s drastically fixed my breakdowns, fixating, anxiety, and insane trains of thought. As a result I’m way more assertive and was able to grow a backbone.

**3) IFS therapy.** This is another lesser-known therapy haha. It’s a method of dealing with PTSD that changed my life once I was medicated and actually able to do it (I had been seeing my therapist for several months and we were struggling because we kept hitting a ‘block’). Eliminated my depression, shame, and destructive coping skills. This was the step that finally got the water out of the boat.

**4) Use CBT/ACT with what you know from IFS.** IFS therapy does all the hard stuff and it puts you in a place where you can use methods from these therapies on your own. With it I’ve built good habits, stuck to them, and it’s built my confidence.

I’ve had a lot of success with this and if you need any resources let me know, haha. Unfortunately I don’t actually know that much about OCD - what exactly do you experience?","e6edv6f",2,1537560621,"2018-09-21 20:10:21"

That’s also not how the ada works.  An employee needs to request an accommodation and usually provide medical documentation to support the request  (it’s called the engaging in the  interactive process and both the employee and employer are required to do this).  Also, while adhd CAN meet the ADA’s definition of qualified disability it’s not an automatic given. You could argue that OP is being ‘harassed because of the perception of a disability bit even then this one situation doesn’t meet the standard of pervasive harassment and it’s also not clear that she is tying the eves-dropping to OP’s medial condition.   

I agree OP should reach out to HR and get educated on  the accommodation process at his organization.

&gt; I'm definitely no medical professional, but with my ADHD my doctor and I talk about how n fall into isolation easily is because I feel super overwhelmed by my surroundings. I wouldn't say I feel anxious, more like a pile of goo who just can't move. 

&gt; So things like relationships or work wouldn't even matter anymore to my goo ADHD brain. Instead when I isolate myself, my brain just latches onto some dumbass distraction to take me away from reality.

&gt; /u/Vivianthecreator 

Pretty much all of the above would come under [ASD, specifically, 'Autistic Meltdown'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum#Behavioral_characteristics) under Sensory Processing Disorder. In my own opinion, even if my diagnosing specialist or psychiatrist may disagree, it is not solely related *to* SPD either.

Not to mention ASD and ADHD (all forms) are quite common 'co-morbidities'.

&amp;nbsp;

I need space.

I go 'round my mate's place (quite good friends, of ~14 years now) for 'drinks' (usually drive, so don't actually drink alcohol) with him, my cousin, and another mutual friend of ours (both him and my cousin are good friends too), usually do this about once a fortnight.

It's always a ton of fun.

Never gone and not had a great time.

But they don't really *comprehend*, just how ***incredibly exhausting*** it is.

It takes me **days** to recover from, without any fuckin alcohol (or drugs, just to be clear) involved.

Simply because of the time and energy required to be around others. Processing sound is incredibly taxing to me, and I have no choice in it. If someone's playing a video in the background while I'm reading/playing something, I keep losing focus onto it and processing what's being said, regardless if I want to or not.

Add in the barrage of noise and emotions, and it's little wonder it doesn't take *longer* for me to recover.

&amp;nbsp;

That's the best example, but far from the only time I need space and 'alone-time'/quiet, to recover.

Can take a few words from a friend or something getting me particularly emotional (for any reason, really, positive or negative), to hurl me off that same cliff and need quiet, and space, to calm back down and ""re-connect"" with people, roommate included.

Could also, in my more (I could swear to being bi-polar...) ""manic"" bursts now and then, days or even a week, to get similarly overwhelmed, even by doing shit like the drinks with my mates, or going out 'spontaneously' (which I utterly hate, and contributes to it) and grabbing shit.

Sometimes it's a slower buildup over a day or so, before I notice I'm losing any and all patience, and don't want to be going anywhere or doing anything/being around anyone, and it clicks why.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I’m kind of averse to medicine (maybe ‘scared of’ or ‘don’t trust’ is better said)

With ADHD, don't be.

Look back at how you've coped thus far.

How often do you have caffeine/coffee?

Sugary drinks (coke, etc.)?

[Dr. Russell Barkley], widely considered a 'leading authority' on ADHD, has mentioned a bit of that in lectures, you can find parts/whole lectures on Youtube, but the one [from 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0) on 'how you treat ADHD', mentions the sugar part, in reference to keeping focused in an exam setting, ""sipping on a bottle of coke"" or something along those lines.

And I realised ***I've done exactly that, unconsciously, for over a decade...***

Sugar cravings, at least if you have ADHD of some variety, is a whole different beast.

Most of the crap around medicating ADHD stems from people who don't understand the science, crying about the naming of the medications and/or seeing that they're derivatives of/are amphetamines, not understanding the difference from say, Methamphetamine, or other variations.

'Our' brains, quite literally, need that kind of 'boost' to make up the deficit in production, to put us as close to ""on-par"" with the average person, as we can get (and can be why caffeine, for some of us, doesn't really 'wake you up' or whatnot).

&amp;nbsp;

A friend of mine is similarly quite 'medicine-averse', and while it's one of the better options, and makes a hell of a difference, it's also not strictly **required**, either.

There's also non-stimulant options you can try, I believe, though is less effective for a smaller group of people, I think.

&amp;nbsp;

You know what surprised me most 'bout starting on the initial Concerta ER dose?

I was sat in the living room as it'd kicked in, and I paused the video I was watching and stopped for a minute, and realised, *it's quiet*.

I could sit there, and **not think**. That eternally running, constantly-switching train of thought *could actually fuck off for a minute*.

Later, in an 'argument'/panic-attack-state talk with the roommate, I realised *I could reply,* **verbally** *in real-time*... I normally needed to fuck off and calm down, then think on it for a day or so, and get back to them.

Even after the meds have *mostly* worn off, my general recall/working memory is better than it used to be. I tend to actually be able to recall what the fuck I was saying 3 seconds ago, when I get interrupted.

I can actually recall if I've taken my meds that day, by whether or not I can *remember* having taken them that day (first-thing in the morning when I wake up, usually).

But even if you're dead-set against them, there's plenty of other options, that 'the rest of us' still need to combine *with* meds, to work on, improve, and 'get by' with.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Oh and might wanna mention to whoever you've been seeing, that you *do* really mean what you say (wanna see her/love her, etc.), but sometimes you need time and space to process and recover from things, good or bad.

Good luck.","gfhuxlg",6,1607753606,"2020-12-12 06:13:26"

Medication allowed me to:

1: Perceive more often when I was talking too much or lingering.

2: Control myself when I found I was talking too much and switch off.


Without medication, I would engage in conversation and follow less often because my mind would be unable to switch from a previous.  If I did participate in a conversation that I could engage, I would never stfu until the topic was exhausted.  Then people would just talk over me because they are done with it, and I wouldnt be able to switch.

Lot's of comments in that one, might be nice to see how common this is for us, or perhaps some tips taht actually work. 

I'll also add my comment from that thread as well, might be useful to think about what has been helping me. But as a tl;dr, I suspect that what helped me most is to occupy my mind, which is why I let my imagination run wild while I'm trying to fall asleep.

=========

I'm not trying to give you actual sleeping advice, but I hope you might be able to pick something up from my sitation, because I used to have huge issues with falling asleep.

It would often take me 30 minutes to a couple of hours, and I could not fall asleep unless it was like 2 am. I always needed to sleep with a light on, as I would become alert if I turned them down (which probably stems from anxiety and/or phobia); and I had to watch a video on YouTube to drown out all the thoughts and anxieties I'd get at night (music or noise alone doesn't work for me). A lot of the times, I ended up eating or drinking warm milk just to force myself to get sleepy.

However, recently I've been able to fall asleep in a couple of minutes after closing my eyes. I changed my sleeping ritual after a conversation with my psychologist, and it has been working perfectly for a couple of weeks now.

Currently, I turn off all my lights and all my sounds, hold my favorite stuffed animal tightly and make myself small. In my head, I put a song on repeat (typically liquid dnb as I listen to that everyday) and I let my visual imagination run loose. I guess it's kinda like daydreaming in my bed, and I either visualize the game I am currently playing, a show or movie I'm watching, or have Pokémon battle each other when I can't come up with something better. Honestly, it's always some kind of battle that fits with the music I'm playing in my head.

I reckon the physical stuff is about making myself feel safe and comfortable, and the imagination stuff is about occupying my mind. I assume I can't image something that I could theoretically do as that would get me excited to act myself, which is why I let imaginary characters battle each other instead of building a sick themepark in Roller Coaster Tycoon. Still works if I wake up in the middle of the night as well.

That said, I do go to bed semi consistent (between 12 and 1am), wake up everyday around 7:30am, take my concerta before 8:30am, try not to eat anything late or drink caffeine. I don't really use my bed for much other than sleeping either. Those are some of the ""standard advice"" were always given that may or may not affect my sleep.

That's what has been working for me, and it might be food for thought. I guess I'm just occupying my mind until I don't need it occupied anymore, as I'm now asleep.","gr47f55",1,1615898729,"2021-03-16 12:45:29"

Use the library. If possible, rent a cube/locker so you can keep all your stuff in one place, and have a distraction free place to work.

Turn off the computer, the phone, all electronics (except maybe an ereader). Print out stuff that you need. The internet is too distracting, it's best to stay away from it when your don't absolutely need it.

"6298","So wait, are you diagnosed with ADHD or no? I'd refrain from jumping to conclusions and assuming you do have ADHD for now. That does nobody any good.

Now, food for thought and consideration, Hypothyroidism often exhibits similar symptoms to ADHD (predominately the inattentive type). This includes a ""mental fog"", mental confusion, fatigue, and such. Then you have something as simple as sleep habits and sleep hygiene could also result in what you're feeling. There's really no saying what causes your midday fatigue, but there are plenty of things outside of ADHD that one would need to consider.

Until you are diagnosed with ADHD, I'd refrain from associating your symptoms with it. Go see a doctor, get a proper diagnosis for whatever you might have and seek appropriate medical treatment and a trained medical professional will help you with all of your concerns.

I did go through a phase where I was depressed. And part of my depression was trying to adjust myself to the way the rest of the world is. I can not and will never be able to be like everyone else. I can't care about what they care about, I mustn't percieve myself through their eyes.

The trouble for me was I had disconnected from my authentic ""root"" or sense of power, or better put, source of magic.

I suspect you may also have a source of magic, but you may have brushed it aside in trying to be normal, do the right thing, or fit in, or even no longer get into trouble.

You've got to find out what that source is. You had it when you were young, it probably helped you release or not build stress and consequently have greater happiness and so naturally greater dopamine ability to focus and care and enjoy and feel rewarded.

So, what do you do if you're in the doldrums and can't find your way because the light within you has dimmed? You can maybe think of the sorts of things that could be your source of magic, your light. Eventually you'll at least be thinking of lighter hearted things and its my belief that if you sleep after continually searching for the brighter things you'll probably get some sort of dream and then what makes you feel alive will come to you. 

&gt; Like when I convinced myself that if I could find just one person I connected to in the world, then I might have motivation to try in life. I could certainly hyper focus on that.

Keep a list of all the friends that you define as being close to you,  and then make it a habit to text or call one of them everytime you see it. Maybe not every time. But anyway, the marker board makes it easy to erase a name in case you decide to hate one of them...  just kidding, the actual reason is so you can write a date next to the names indicating the last time you talked to that person. Then whenever you check up on your dear friend, you can erase the old date and write the new one. What window of time is too long is your preference, but as long as you have a list of your close friends and how long it's been since you gave them a moment of your time, you should see an improvement according to my hypothesis. 

I suffer from the same thing, I think I get too deep in my own life and my uncommon interests that I don't share with my friends that I forget that my friends probably think I'm neglecting them when I basically go off the radar. I like being alone and I like being with friends, so I might go days without responding to texts or whatever.

"6361","Think of your brain as a clock, a clock starts at 1 and goes to 12 and to complete a day it must go from 1 to 12 in a specific order.

Well your brain and the frontal lobe works the same way.  It has 5 different networks from a structural perspective.

* 1)  Emotion Generative Network, aka approach and withdrawl.  Located in the middle of the brain, and the middle / midline of the frontal lobe between the left and right halves of the brain

* 2)  Emotion Control Network **A** near the eyes on the bottom of the frontal lobe.  Controls your emotions by generating new emotions to fine tune behavior so you pursue long term goals.

* 3) Emotion Control Network **B** on the outside of the frontal lobe.  If you were to place your hands between your ears and your eyes you would be touching these areas.

* 4) Motor Planning and Pre Action.  If you were to place your palm of your hand on your eyebrows and your fingers pointing up this is roughly where your knuckles would be.

* 5) Motor Action.   If you were to place your hands on your eyebrows this would be roughly where the joint between your knuckles and your finger tips would be.

So to do any form of decision or action the brain must do 1 followed by 4 and 5.

If you do not have enough dopamine and norepinephrine you skip 2 and 3 and go straight to 1-&gt;4-&gt;5

But if you have too much dopamine and norepinephrine you also skip 2 and 3 and go stragiht to 1-&gt;4-&gt;5

In both situations you are using your ""fast / automatic brain"" but you are doing so for different reasons.  If you are underaroused your brain is saying nothing is important and you do not need to think about anything and you can be on autopilot.

But if you are overaroused your brain does whatever it thinks it should do from an emotional standpoint.  Whether its avoiding danger, or being superfocused on things you find reward but not are really going to affect yourself towards your long term goals.

Only when your dopamine and norepinephrine levels are in the medium zone will you uses 2 and 3.

-----

Now there is actually a 6th network which if you place the base of your palm on your eyebrows it would be where your palm of your hand.  This is the most ""frontal area"" of the frontal lobe known as the frontal polar cortex, or the anterior prefrontal cortex.  It is the coordinator of activities when you are in the ideal zone of dopamine and norepinephrine and further fine tunes all of those five networks from 1 to 5.

It works as a very good secretary who helps out your executive and helps you organize your behavior to achieve your goals.  It is the frontal lobe coordinating itself with your subcortical areas such as your basal ganglia, your thalamus, your brain stem, and your cerebellum.

-----

In summary more meds is not always a good thing with ADHD but finding the ideal zone which is different in each person.  This is why some people do well on stimulants if they have ADHD but also why we have other medications for ADHD that work on the same neurotransmitters but in different ways.  It is also why stimulants sometimes help non ADHD people focus, but also why sometimes its counterproductive.  And when it helps people focus it may help you clean house or having a singled minded focus but it may not actually help learning if you are not ADHD or if you are ADHD and the dose is too high for you actually need networks 6, 3 and 2 to be operating and talking to each other to be the most effective and to understand things instead of just route memorization which is network number 4.

**Why does this happen?** Its because you actually have different types of dopamine and norepinephrine systems and they act as switches on and off of whether to turn on this brain area or that brain area and certain combinations of these specific dopamine and norepinephrine receptors/ sensors being turned on or off activate different brain areas so you think with your fast brain on autopilot for things are boring, fast brain on autopilot for you need fast reaction speeds, or slow brain so you can process and chew on information and make sure distractions do not get you off your long term goals.

You basically just need to tell them that you suspect you may have it and would like it checked out. Even your primary care physician might be able to help.   
If anyone ever tells you 'its not real' or 'you cant have it cuz reasons' - run for the hills and look for help someplace else. Even if thats incredibly frustrating.  


I can't tell you specifics about insurance and stuff, and also it depends on how supportive your parents will be. It sounds like you may have it, so I absolutely recommend you check it out, even without their blessing. Thats also related to the next point:

"6382","I do this too, except I'm not in school anymore so it's all just boring adult stuff or various hobby stuff that I actually want to do but I end up putting off. For the stuff that's really important, like paying bills, I set phone alarms to go off at like 10am on a weekend day when I know I won't be doing anything else but will probably be awake in bed staring at my phone. Sometimes I can wrangle a friend or my boyfriend into doing something with me (or just reminding me that I wanted to do it), thereby obligating me to do the task. And sometimes if I can get started with one easy task and don't sit back down afterward, I can use that momentum and keep plowing through some more tasks. On a really good weekend, I can reasonably expect to get through maybe up to 3/4 of my list, but there's always stuff that gets ignored. Some weekends at 9:30pm I'll do the dishes out of frustration, just to say I accomplished something. 

I think it's more a matter of practice, like one weekend you do one thing on your task and you celebrate the hell out of the fact that you did. Then next weekend you try and beat your high score of 1, either wth another 1 task or even 2 if you're feeling ambitious. Keep at it until you're doing 5 whole tasks per weekend like it ain't no big thang. Reward yourself when you realize how far you've come, and keep trying. Celebrate whatever you manage to accomplish, and don't beat yourself up about what you don't accomplish. Pretend like you're training a new puppy (i.e. your brain), positive reinforcement works way better than negative. Doesn't matter how old you are, your puppy brain needs positive reinforcement and a good dose of patience from you. 

And if you are in school, don't fall prey to the tendency to feel guilty every time you're not doing school work. Literally schedule in some down time, whatever relaxes you, make sure you do it, but then stop at the end of your scheduled time. You'll feel better for having relaxed, and you won't feel guilty if you deliberately chose to relax, rather than doing it out of a compulsion to avoid work.

60mgs total makes me crash hard.

"6414","Been on 80mg strattera since October of 2015, so several months now. The Lexapro is huge for anxiety for me, maybe not so much with depression? the reason I mention it for ADHD is that anxiety makes it much harder for me to do anything productive, I find my thoughts mostly circling around ways to get rid of the anxiety instead of completing the task at hand, which puts me further behind and increases anxiety and forms a very nasty feedback loop. 

I can definitely see the dangers with adderall, I've had addiction problems in the past which is why the doctors have pushed me to try other non-stimulant solutions first. I was mostly functional even though the ADHD was pretty obvious until my early 20s, was near the top of my class in highschool and graduated undergrad without much of an issue but had it all come apart during graduate school. Since I had this sort of pattern my psych and therapist explained that the depression/anxiety is what pushed me into the realm of problematic ADHD symptoms. So far my experience with all the various medications (strattera, lexapro, ritalin, wellbutrin, adderall, concerta, xanax... not to mention caffeine, nicotine, medical marijuana and various other illicit drugs) has led me to believe that  nothing is going to 'fix' me and suddenly make everything work better. 

I'm not sure how bad your ADHD is or what specific aspects of it you're hoping to get improvements in, but at least for me the best I'm hoping to get out of the medication is enough stability to set up a routine that lets me be a productive member of society.","czxna3r",1,1455305176,"2016-02-12 19:26:16"

What finally made me realize that I’m definitely not making this up was when I recently stopped medication after 3 years of being on it.  Off medication symptoms seriously intensified and life got a lot harder. It made me realize that especially off medication I function completely different from neurotypicals. 

The other day I shared this realization with my husband and he looked at me like I was crazy then said “You *definitely* have ADHD. There’s no way you’re making that up.” 

My point: Professionals know what they’re talking about, if you’re questioning it like this you’re probably not just looking for an “easy way out,” and sometimes you can’t see how debilitating something can be until you stop treatment and see the difference.","ezq7cl8",1,1568055689,"2019-09-09 19:01:29"

I told my doctor who let me try Vyvanse / Elvanse instead and it's been a *much* smoother ride. I do sometimes still get anxiety when it wears off, but it's rarer and not as intense.  
  
If you search this sub you'll see lots of other people get anxiety issues on concerta and ritalin too, so it's not just us!  I know that's not much help for right now in the moment, but it could be something worth exploring?

"6458","It is not a black or white issue it is more complicated than that.  Feeling sedated on methyphendiate is a normal response it is not necessary the drug is bad but has more to do with fine tuning of the meds.  Getting a good drug at the specific amount at hours 2, 4,6,8, 10, etc during the day.

[PDF Link: Skip to slide 38 on this pdf.](http://learningcenter.unc.edu/files/2014/10/Thomas-Brown_Burnett-Seminar_11.14_Slide-Set-1.pdf)

[YouTube Link:Dr Thomas Brown of Yale talks about ADHD medications](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RbYEuJ2Akc&amp;t=38m0s) now I started this video roughly where he starts talking about medicines but eventually he wull get to a yellow curve and he talks about when the side effects appear.

Methyphendiate can make you feel sedated for two very different reasons both connected to dopamine and norepinephrine receptors but different receptors and different reason.

* One way is when the med wears off it makes you feel drowsy and less alert.  This is because your body uses norepinephrine and dopamine as signaling molecules when to release energy, heart rate etc.  If your neurotransmitters drop too fast your body interpret this as take a break and rest.  Modify the drug delivery or a smaller booster can counter this. Also very effective is 30 mins to an hour prior to this time (usually near the evening meal) you specifically release for 30 mins which in turn modifies how your body uses energy due to neurotransmitters and endorphins your brain releases for exercise.  Also stay well hydrated and eat at least a light meal prior to this drop.  Besides feeling sedated other people show slightly different side effects but effectively the same cause but different presentation, so e people are easily irritable/grumpy during this time period, or thsy feel depressed/blue, or can be easily angry or snappy at people and bite someone's head off.

* If these symptoms happen in the morning or afternoon this is a different thing. Stimulants increase norepinephrine and adrenaline and too much at once usually gives you energy but can also make you fatigue similar to burn out.  In this case the dose is too high or too fast.

**You need to be talking to your doctor not the net he will be better at fine tunning your meds than us.**

"6498","The single best thing my SO has ever done for my problems is simply to acknowledge that I have them, and not shame me for it. My parents instilled a deep anxiety in me over losing things. My dad used to ground me or take away privileges/activities if he had to help me find something I had lost when he was busy with something else. It wasn't until I was in my 20's that I learned I had a tendency to lose and/or forget things more than your average person.

I went to the bank last month to deposit a cheque, and when I got to the teller I couldn't find it. I was already 3 days late paying the rent (it's a non-issue to my landlord if it's not in on the 1st of the month exactly) and had forgotten every day for 3 days to go to the bank. Now here I was, proud of myself for remembering to go to the bank- and I had lost my cheque. I nearly started crying (emotional regulation can be a problem for ADHD people) in front of the teller and kept repeating out loud how worried I was I had lost the cheque, and how upset I thought my boyfriend would be. The teller gave me a sad look until I realized how I was overreacting and this was NOT the end of the world. I said ""don't worry, he's not abusive, just naggy"" and we both shared a laugh. I paid the rent out of my savings instead, and went home. 

I was so worried about the guilt, the shame, and the repeated idiocy of forgetting and losing things and disappointing my boyfriend that I forgot I couldn't find the cheque because I had already deposited it. When I got home and told my boyfriend, all he did was laugh and give me a big hug to say ""it's okay"". ","co07hbs",16,1422191691,"2015-01-25 13:14:51"

"6502","For my main GTD ""inbox"" - i use the Evernote App/system. 
Evernote makes a really good inbox for me, since it has a ""quick note"" app on mac, as well as a web clipper for chrome. Also, the Android app has a good selection of quick-add widgets which let me fire off a quick note really quickly on my phone. 

When something pops up in your brain, or some task you need to do comes up from a conversation - the name of the game is to ""get it in there"" (and out of your brain) as FAST as you can, so you can recover from the tangent/distraction as quickly as possible before your working memory overflows with too many parallel things to remember. 

Low working memory is a big part of ADD - so the better you can get at offloading emergent thoughts/tasks from your working memory - the more you will be able to maintain focus. 

Then, every morning (im thinking of doing this twice a day now) I make sure I empty all my inboxes and put them into the other parts of my ""system"" (i.e. calendar, project lists, etc). GTD gets into this other stuff - and that stuff is important to. Inboxes are unstructured to allow for speed of use, but you need to transition tasks to something more structured so you can actually know what to act on and when.

"6503","I always felt something was wrong with me but I had no idea what. Looking at endless wikipedia articles about mental illness and trying to figure out whats wrong didn't help. I only discovered than I had selective mutism throughout that. (like wow it has a name? people act like this besides me?)

I would hyperfocus into games and just play them 12 hours a day, typically had a hard time paying attention to movies or similar things, was very clingy to my partners, put as little effort into school as possible while still getting B grades, have a sensitivity to lights/sunlight &amp; sensitivity to touch, would procrastinate any project to the last minute, had really bad task initiation ability.

I'm quite sensitive to noise (at my school they would force kids in the gym for a band/pep rally, i was the only one covering my ears). This has developed more into a talent now, in competitive shooters I generally don't miss any sound queue, like if someone accidentally makes a footstep from far away I know exactly where it is.

I have rejection sensitive dysphoria, I've only learned about this recently but its very common in people with ADHD. I would be deeply upset about rejection for long periods of time, I would even isolate myself because of the feelings. Maybe this partially contributed to my selective mutism that lasted throughout middleschool up until this last year.

The predominantly inattentive is quite underdiagnosed, more so in girls. Normal grades and no hyperactivity :/. I only realized that I had adhd when I took a 10mg adderall. I became calm for once, truly my anxiety was eliminated in a way that abusing xanax, painkillers, weed, alcohol, etc had never been able to accomplish. I could have a conversation without my mind completely going blank while the other person is speaking and then turning into a long awkward silence. Before then I thought that was just social anxiety.

ADHD manifests in many different ways, most are talkative unlike I was. It is a dopamine issue and people have a wide range of experiences/coping mechanisms.

A general practitioner can prescribe ADHD medications, might attempt that route if its cheaper/easier. I go to a psychiatrist that specializes in ADHD and there is no hassle, the GP is less likely to help.","dov9c1r",1,1508941882,"2017-10-25 14:31:22"

Simply put, focusing on that show for 2.5 hours is tough for anyone, I don't believe there is much you can do to help it, since as a sound guy, you actually do have to remain focused on it pretty much the whole time. That said, basic things like keeping a good schedule, a good routine, getting the proper amount of sleep, eating right and such, all will help to an extent, especially since most people in the field don't tend to do any of those things.

You may want to try a bit of caffeine. For many people it produces a bit of a calming down effect, it might be enough for you.

As a lighting guy....I can do whatever between cues, beyond maybe having to manage a few things like fog machines or the like, it's not a constant need to adjust/tweak things like you have, so the need for focus is less intense, my job is more focused around the prep for the show, while running it is mostly just hitting go.","c7a652f",1,1354482613,"2012-12-02 21:10:13"

I consider all scenarios and outcomes and come to conclusions on how I think something can be done in the most effective way, especially in traffic. I verbalize my thoughts often and he takes them as criticism. When really I’m just noticing literally everything going on around us and sometimes those thoughts come out of my mouth. He hates it and says it makes him feel like I don’t trust his driving or whatever else he thinks I’m criticizing. We’ve been together 20 years and he still has a hard time understanding that some of the behaviors or traits I have that he doesn’t like are due my ADD and I can’t always control them.

When I started my Bachelor's degree, I tested into precalculus, a class I had already taken in my last year of highschool. It was taught like traditional mathematics. No matter how much I paid attention or did the homework, I could never do well on the exams. Same thing with all of my calculus, discrete math, and linear algebra courses.

"6564","Yes you should mention to your doctor any other medication you are on including SSRIs.

Sometimes SSRIs help ADHD meds, sometimes they hurt it, and sometimes neither.  This is because the serotonin system is highly integrated into the dopamine system and vice versa.  Specific types of serotonin receptors increase dopamine in specficic brain areas, while other decrease it so when emotional stimuli happens your body better adjusts to it.

SSRIs do not affect the specific serotonin receptors directly, what they do is they cause serotonin your body to naturally release to last longer between nerve cells before little vaccum pumps suck up the serotonin and place it into storage.  Some of the ADHD meds work the same way but for norepinephrine and dopamine vacuum pumps, and even if they block the little vacuum pumps how and where they do so in the brain is different (Strattera is different than Mehthyphendiate such as Concerta, Amphetamine such as Adderall and Vyvanse is different than both of those)

-----

In fact a couple of ADHD meds in development which may come out in a few years or may not come out in a few years seek to modify the serotonin system where they act as synthetic serotonin for some of those serotonin receptors but not other serotonin receptors (thus working different than SSRIs, which increase serotonin lasting longer for all serotonin receptors) for those serotonin receptors control dopamine and norepinephrine to some extent in brain areas that would help ADHD.

Good Luck :)

"6576","Thanks for the reply and kind words.

I tend to think or call it ""autopilot"" when I do things other than what I intended/planned to.

If it's distraction, and then totally forgetting (blankness) the current or original task then I tend to use ""Ooooh, shiny!"" as a way of expressing what's happened or is happening.  I use this because most people can understand and relate.  And that ""Ooooh shiny!"" isn't always an external thing, but often is just an random idea or thought that suddenly appeared or popped into my mind, and ""shiny"" thing ends up blotting our or overriding what I was already doing or supposed to be doing.  And the ""autopilot"" allows me to usually finish the current physical thing I was doing (putting on coat, take out pots and pans or the like).  But once the ""autopilot"" has finished the task, and ""disengages"" all that's there is ""shiny"" or more often than not the ""shiny"" has popped out or moved on and I'm left just wondering what the heck was I doing, why was I doing what I had just done, and what in the hell am I supposed to be doing??   

Then I realize that I've totally forgotten what I was trying/planning to do.  So, I try my best to remember, and if I can't and I can't figure it out by looking at what I was doing or just did, I take a llok at my dry erase board/calendar.  I also might try retracing my steps, to see if something triggers me. If it's obvious that it's not important I just throw in the towel and go back to doing something else.

It's way easier if this happens during non-business hours, because that tends to mean that I'm not missing something that might be consequential.

For out of sight out of mind, I end up using babies and toddlers as the example, since they tend to have this and people both know and understand this, to this I add ""selective blindness"" which is out of sight out of mind, when or even if the item is sitting right in front of me.  

I've also used train tracks to express how the distraction process happens for me, and that sometimes when I switch tracks (often unintentionally) there's no way to quickly switch back, because like a train line, you can only switch, where there's a place to switch, and you actually have to remember to switch when you get to that point.  The other option would be to ""stop"" and then back up, but this too is difficult or nearly impossible, because it's hard to stop a train, and there are other trains (thoughts/ideas) coming down the line, so in many cases stopping results in a total train wreck (scrambled thoughts/ideas and panic/stress) which makes stopping and reversing to try to get back on to the original track often too dangerous to try to do.

I totally get your post decision process, due to the difficulty involved in reaching a decision, I think subconsciously you end up worrying if your choice was the right or best choice.  And this is why they end up staying present and more importantly it happens in a ""intense"" way.

I use a/follow a certain set of ""criteria"" or ""rules"" when I make a decision that helps me to stick with the one I actually chose.

I simply pick ""the easiest, right way"" when it's time to make a decision.  I do this because it's usually pretty easy to figure out which way or choice would be ""easiest"" to do, and it's also pretty easy to know which of the possible/potential choices would work or bee successful.   

I'm lazy, that's a fact, so I know that it would be silly to do something in the ""wrong way"" regardless of how ""easy"" it may be to do, because a failure, which would be the logical outcome of doing something the wrong way, would meant that the effort that was just used, was wasted and I still have to do the task.

This is what leads me to always choose ""the easiest, right way"" every time.  And by ""easy"" it includes things like time, effort, energy and then balancing the cost ($$) that's involved with each ""right way"" and I choose the best overall one, and then I just execute it.  If it works, then done!  If it doesn't work, then I just go to the next less, easier, right way.  I repeat this until I'm successful, but most of the time, the first choice ends up working, so I don't have to try any other options.

I am glad to hear that I've been helpful, I know it's so hard to try to use words to express/explain what's going on.

I do recommend, that you take a notebook (actual paper) with an outline of the things that you think are important and that you want to say.

Also it might help to make a list of phrases that you want to use to express yourself and things that are going on.

I say this, because it's really easy to just go ""blank"" when you get to your appointment, and having a list, a simple list that's on paper, might be a good idea, this is what I tend to do, because it works, and a notebook with paper, tends to not crash, or have other issues.

I also use a single post-it note square, to use as a book mark/flag, to let me know where I'm supposed to start or where I last stopped at.

I do not use multiple flags or at least try to keep it at one, I might use more than one to mark where I'm supposed to start and one to mark where the ""blank"" pages start.  I limit myself, because once you go past two or three, they end up being more of a hinderance than help.

Feeling like a failure and being unable to change turned into a very negative cycle.

The afternoon/evening before, make a plan, or at least a list of things you want to do, and be specific. These should be tasks your brain can understand. Either set a specific realistic goal (""clean all the floors and/or tabletops"", ""read 50 pages"") or set an amount of time (""read for one hour"", ""study for 30 minutes"") for each task.

See how well you can stick to the plan, or how many items you can check off. Try not to feel like you've been defeated if you miss something, especially early on, as this easily leads to giving up on the whole day. Including a few low pressure and/or low effort tasks will make this easier.

"6625","I honestly couldn't tell you. When I was talking to my doc he really emphasised that it doesn't matter at all whether you're taking more or less than other people, since it's so individualistic and they don't know what all the factors are that determine why some people respond better etc at lower doses. 

My theory is that since it's a developmental disorder then it's possible that the different life experiences people have had has either made that neural impediment more or less significant; also he mentioned that he's had some patients try MPH at an effective dose, then realise they don't need it because they're able to self-generate the same effect, remarkably. 

With IR you essentially have to remember to take your second dose at the right time, and you have sharper ups and downs, whereas the XR tends to be smoother across the day. You'll have to give no-caffeine a bit longer, because remember, you're used to having it every day, so going back to baseline will take a short time - thing is the effect caffeine can have on your sleep, and then sleep's knock-on effect on how well MPH works is really significant. 

Sleep is 100% going to impact you, especially if you've lost that much, which is huge if you think about it, about 38% less time than recommended 8hrs. Two whole cycles. 

The issue with caffeine especially is it can still affect your sleep-quality even if you don't consciously feel it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWn4BP7oTpY

"6627","He's right. Hear me out...this isn't an asshole devil's advocate post. 

I was diagnosed at age 10. I'm 39 now, so I'm no stranger to ADD. &lt;-- Old school name. I went through 2/3 of my college career with a 2.7 GPA. I finished with a 3.6. I was on meds for 2 years when I was diagnosed. Back then, they thought that stimulants had the opposite effect after puberty, so at 12, I was left with nothing. Life is full less-than-engaging situations: classes, church, doctor appointments, etc. I learned how to deal with every one. My main remedy was an ever-present backpack that I took EVERYWHERE filled with items ""in case I got bored"". That was before the benefit of Internet, tablets, Android, iPhone, etc. I doodled my way through classes and found that I actually heard more. I learned that studying with music or some mindless TV station entertained the part of my brain prone to wander. I still had to work twice as hard and longer than anyone else, but I did it with a nice chunk of government money because I had ADD. I went through an organization, called Vocational Rehabilitation. I encourage you to look into it if you need some extra financial aid. I had to go through an evaluation which obviously concluded I was still symptomatic hence the money.

You can do this. Fuck uneducated douchebags. If the meds don't work, why take them? 

On the other side of all of this....I hold a job, and I do well for myself. I have talked to countless people like yourself. For me, ADD was a gift that paid my way through college and gives me the ability to think fast. You'll get there. I promise you it gets better. If you want to talk, I'm available. I hope something I said helps. I wish you the best.","clt65cn",2,1415146467,"2014-11-05 00:14:27"

"6629"," ***YES.*** Absolutely. I could have written that last paragraph myself.

Your mixed feelings of hope and fear in anticipation of answers are very normal and very valid. I sometimes wonder if denial is just part of the diagnostic process. 

For me, this was my “normal” for so long. Functioning at school and work but feeling just utter chaos inside, that was my normal. Slowly picking up coping strategies in order to put in the work “where it mattered,” leaving no energy to take care of myself or my living space at the end of the day. I didn’t know anything else, and because it was so internal and I was, on the outside, functioning relatively well, no one suspected anything. 

So yes, I did worry, and continue to worry, that no one will believe me when I talk about this thing that seems so antithetical to the image I present. Even doctors. *Especially* doctors. Although my wonderful PMHNP immediately took my concerns seriously when I mentioned ADHD, I *still* worry that maybe I’m wrong, and I’ll be found out, and everyone will know that I was wrong and either a liar or an absolute fool. 

(By the way, for me at least, these thoughts are absolutely a product of anxiety.) 

Can I ask what it was that finally made you consider ADHD? What was your “tipping point,” so to speak? ","e16ulj1",4,1529802879,"2018-06-24 01:14:39"

But in my case, sometimes the truth is I just don't want to do ""the chore thing' so I have had to find various ways to get myself kickstarted. 

u/weeeezzil's method of piling stuff up  in one spot, and working from there is great.. There is something  symbolic and affirming of being able to see a space where there was no space before. 

This is one of the best reasons for making your bed everyday.   Everytime you look at it, you will feel better and more capable of handling the bigger problems.

I also have a range of Bach Flower Remedies that I use for tweaking my spirit body. A few drops in a water bottle for a few days, and I am squared away for a while.

If you are in a medical mariujuana state, there are certain strains, like Green Crack, that have been noted for being very helpful for the ADD/ADHD syndrome.

Sometimes, I trick myself into working, by saying, ""Okay Spirit, I can give you 10% of the effort it is going to take to do this, but if you want it done, you are going to have to chip in the other 90%."" Once I get started, I usually end up exceeding the promised 10% and feeling quite virtuous

Other times I remind me that getting off my a\*\* and doing something is healthy and burns calories.

Speaking of which....it's time to do that  again.

"6631","Um.... that's not a seizure, like not even close, I promise you that. I've seen people go into them and they were completely out of the blue and disabling. By the time they came to, they were extremely confused and sore. The ones who had a history of it happening frequently usually knew when it was coming, but it was more rare because they were already on meds for it. Most of those times I witnessed them were when I worked at a jail and inmates were going into a seizure months after going to jail, normally for possession of heroin. I also hold an EMT cert. Watched an older person go into a seizure and it was also out of the blue and it turned out that she had Lupus.

"6642","So a big issue with mood is that our medications (especially XR, since it is so consistent throughout the day) make it difficult to hear our hunger and thirst levels, and general fatigue; a lot of my irritation actually comes from hunger, thirst, and over-investing in activities (since you don't always *feel* like you need a break, but you definitely get that all at once during the crash).  

Things that help a lot, for me: have a food that is a mixture of whole fats (greek yogurt, avocado, something unhealthy is fine too as long as you have real fat and not simply saturated or trans; it's for the slow digestive properties and hunger satiating effects).  Have something with protein; if you're not hungry yet, make yourself eat a little something (trail mix etc) because you'll be more likely to wait until you're already super, super overextended. I am not sure why this combination helps so much for me but I find carbs do little to nothing during a crash.

Do something for self-care that is a personal activity; something that you'd do if you had a bad day, or if you were burnt out emotionally. A lot of times we can push through our irritation, sadness, and anxiety while medicated. For me, it may be yoga, skincare routine, a 10 minute shower (even if it's just to indulge).  Activities where your mind can wander are extra nice.

 We can find that motivation/drive, but that doesn't mean our brains fully processed all the emotions and concerns of the day; that gets put on the back burner until we have time to unpack and let our thoughts drift.  So if you don't have any down time (in a mental sense), you're gonna get all of that at once when your meds wear off. It's the same when you are unmedicated, and you're trying to sleep, and suddenly all those memories from elementary school or stressors from the day seem like they're huge and looming (lots of thought loops).  The harder you push them down/want them to disappear, the more they will bounce back and loom in your mind.  Mindfulness and meditation, as well as recognizing the thoughts but not feeling as if you have to act on them, is very helpful for this.

Finally, having some mantras/phrases that remind you that the intensity of the crash is related to being medicated can provide some comfort.  Just like the feeling of being ""on"" from your meds is due to their effects, the intensity of the ""off"" isn't all on you; you may know this logically, but part of you may still feel stressed or anxious because you feel out of control or powerless in the face of all the depression, anxiety, and stress. Part of you may still believe, deep down, that you shouldn't feel this way; challenging that belief is hard, and takes time.

Reminding yourself that this is a chemical response primarily, and not you being weak/having poor control over your emotions and thoughts, can make it feel less overwhelming.  Things like ""a car can't run on empty, and my body has used most of its fuel.  Would I expect an extra 10 miles when the tank isn't full?"" or ""Right now I feel down, but I also know tomorrow that I will have a full day, and I will only feel like this when it is time to rest"" and ""this has happened before, and I made it. I can do this"" etc.

Be gentle with yourself. I say this a lot, but I emphasize it because there is a lot of pressure to **function in how we feel/believe/know is more ideal for our health, with little room for human weakness**. The urge to be on the same page/level as everyone else often makes us more critical on ourselves than others when it comes to our behavior; after all, isn't our goal to function to the best of our ability?   But, in pursuing this, we often panic at our grumpiness, anxiety, and depression; we have been struggling for so long that it is difficult to differentiate between a healthy level versus one we may consider (or may be, depending on our own experiences) illness (and especially if we have been in very low places before, we may fear sinking back into that abyss that we desperately clawed out of).

**tl;dr: Addressing your body's direct needs, such as hunger, thirst, and physical/emotional fatigue should be first. Then, self-care activities, as well as considering practices used to address anxiety/thought loops/bad days**

I wrote more than I intended, but I feel this almost every day, so I hope it was helpful.

I'm planning to switch medication when I can because the fogginess is quite a pain, but I have to wait it out for a month to see if being on the 50mg again may help. Remember though that if it really disagrees with you, you can stop taking it. From what I remember being told, Strattera doesn't have the withdrawal issues that other ADHD meds can have so if it's really unbearable you can stop.

Just keep in mind Strattera doesn't work the same way a stimulant does, so you might find it initially underwhelming in comparison. It's not going to give you the same amount of productivity as a stimulant, but you find you will have the motivation and focus to do something you wouldn't before.

"6668","I have a 13 month old so not that long ago I dealt with this. My doctor was on board to let me take vyvanse (albeit at the lowest dosage) if I felt that being off my meds was having a detrimental effect. For example, if my poor work performance being off meds was going to get me fired. An unemployed and extremely stressed momma is possibly more negative than taking a medication that they don’t have enough pregnancy data on. I ultimately made the decision for myself that I wanted to quit the meds since I felt like my tolerance was getting up there and wanted to take a med vacation soon anyway. 

I’m fortunate enough that my employer is aware of my ADHD, so I gave my boss the heads up that I was pregnant and would be tapering off my medication and to be patient with me over the next 8-9 months. They were very understanding (and happy for me lol). I really had to make a point of writing things down when someone asked me to do something. I never bought the fat kids markers to write my notes in big letters on my note pad lol. As for personal stuff, your calendar and reminders apps are your best friends. Also recommend having a shared calendar and reminder list with your SO or family member you live with. Will help tremendously if they need you to do something or you need help remembering to do something (like taking a pet to a vet appointment or getting your oil changed or whatever)

Also I cannot stress this enough if you want/have to quit: TAPER OFF YOUR MEDS!! One time I was on 50mg Vyvanse and quit cold turkey. Worst 2 weeks of my life ever. I wanted nothing more than to sleep and eat everything I could shove in my face. Regardless if you or your doctor makes the decision to stop meds, ask your dr to step you down over the course of at least 3-4 weeks. ","ebv0vfd",5,1544903376,"2018-12-15 19:49:36"

I’d be more productive if someone were theoretically watching me and I never planned on uploading these vlogs but who would want to watch me lay in bed all day, you know?

"6672","I take 3x15mg Sandoz MePh IR, generic Ritalin, a day. I take the first dose chewed 15 minutes before I have to get up. I won't be able to fall asleep, because the effect starts to come up.

15 minutes later I am fully awake. 

30 minutes later I'm ready for breakfast. The best part of this method is that the meds haven't kicked in full force yet and thus I still have a healthy appetite. 

Next dose is around 12:00 or 12:30, during or after lunch, so the meds take a while longer to kick in and last longer. 

Last dose is around 15:00, but only if I need it. Or I take a lower dose. 


Tips:

- for the first few days, take it after your breakfast. Might help with stomach pain, anxiety and blurriness or dizziness. This goes away in a week.

- no caffeine. At least for the first few days. If you want caffeine, drink a little bit first and test it out. The order also matters. Always meds first, then caffeine 45 minutes later at least. Not the other way around. Something with the amp metabolism.

- don't take brakes when you are still in titration. You want the speedy effect to disappear. This way you can also find out the right dose.

- if you start feeling strange, eat. A lot. Even if you feel full. It's your blood sugar being to low. Don't drive in this condition. 

- if you feel a headache coming up, chug a couple glasses of water. Better yet, drink a lot of water anyway.

- If you're feeling rushy or anxiety, settle down, drink some rooibos tea (seriously, this calms ya right down; no normal tea. Caffeine!) and put up some chill music. 

- side effects you may notice the first few days: higher blood pressure, faster heartbeat, tingling hands, tingling head, dizziness. This will probably go away after a while. Higher doses will bring back these effects.

"6676","I'm on 10mg three times a day.  It gives me coverage the entire day so that's a major plus.  At first I thought I was developing a tolerance but then I realized that it was just that I had adjusted to the medication; it wasn't like the first time that I took it where not only did I get a crazy sense of euphoria but also I could notice myself focusing extra hard.  I realize that it still works though because I can read several chapters of a book without getting distracted, and I can remember things easily, which means that my working memory benefits are still there.  

Also, I'm less likely to speak when it's inappropriate and I'm getting a ton of school work done.  I've read that ritalin tolerance doesn't happen or that it's less likely to happen than adderall tolerance since ritalin doesn't boost your levels of dopamine, it just keeps your brain from absorbing the dopamine that it already produces, whereas adderall's main function is to increase dopamine and to a lesser extent it keeps it from being re-absorbed.  

Just think of it like taking steroids which would boost your testorone levels, vs. some drug that just keeps your natural testosterone levels from diminishing.  There are some people who have been on ritalin for decades and have not developed a tolerance.  Right now I'm going on 4 months and the same dosage is working; I had previously been on 10mg ritalin twice a day, which I was on for 3 years but I had to stop for a few years because I lost coverage under my parents insurance.  In those 3 years I didn't notice it's effects diminishing.  Worst case scenerio if you start to develop a tolerance you can just ask for an increase to 15mg or 20mg dosages and keep doing that for a few years until you reach the maximum dosage that can be prescribed.  

Also, if you take a few weeks or months off, you lose the tolerance that you developed.  I noticed that when I got back on ritalin after 4 years of being off of it; it was like being on it for the first time again.  So, the good news is that even if you develop a tolerance to it, it's reversible if you just stop taking it for a bit.  So, if you're a student and you don't have any classes during the summer you can just stop taking it for a few months and then start taking it again in the fall; that way you'll never develop a tolerance.  

However, like I said before, I don't think that it's even possible to develop a tolerance to ritalin unless a person abuses their medication and takes too much at once, or snorts/injects it.","cqpeih9",1,1430073762,"2015-04-26 18:42:42"

There is one thing that he taught me, and he always said to NEVER SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY WILL TWIST YOUR WORDS. INVOKE YOUR MIRANDA RIGHTS. He taught us and we studied case law where things were drastically twisted against people. He always said, ""I don't care if you're telling the truth, request a lawyer and do not make one peep!""

Was the Dexedrine in plain sight? I'm going to assume that it was in this instance, but in instances of illegal search and seizures, anything found in an illegal search and seizure is inadmissible in court meaning they can't hold it against you. 

One of the best things you can do is besides not say anything and wait for a lawyer, is to do the research yourself. Research the laws and read the actual penal codes. Read case law. READ READ READ READ READ. Seriously. I've learned a lot by just reading (and professors) and because of it, I know how to protect myself against the law.

Cause you aren't saying ""I /have/ ADHD"" as though you've already been diagnosed, which is what I've seen many self-diagnosed people do. You just think you have it, which is an important start to diagnosing anything. So telling a doc "" /I think/ I have ADHD"" is just a good jumping off point for them, something to dig into and look for symptoms. 
It's how my anxiety got diagnosed. I straight up told my doc ""I think I have general anxiety"" so he asked me some questions, agreed, and got me in contact with a therapist who properly diagnosed me. This was like 5 years ago in my hometown, so I no longer have that therapist. But it was good and went pretty smooth.

Not all adhd is the same, there are different types, and unfortunately most people (some doctors included)  see adhd as someone who is constantly bouncing off the walls with hyperactivity. I had multiple doctors say well you're not hyperactive so it can't be adhd, had one doctor tell me that my being late for literally everything doesn't effect my everyday life.

This shortish documentary is actually really good, has good information about adult adhd and how it can go undiagnosed in childhood and stuff I suggest watching it.

"6733","This is TL;DR BUT

I had problems functioning in elementary school, high school, and the first two years of my undergraduate degree. Then, suddenly, things got *interesting.* I went to grad school and 4 years + 10 months later I had a Master's and Ph.D. I was convinced this meant I did not have ADHD. How do you succeed in grad school without discipline?

Then I went to work a corporate job and fell apart because I had to stick to a schedule and do things I did not find interesting. Four years + a few breakdowns + some mental health crises + diagnosis + medication + therapy later, I'm more OK now. I'm 34. I learned not long ago that I had actually been diagnosed when I was 10 but my parents hid it from me. I was angry about that for awhile, wishing I'd just known about this invisible, dominating force in my life sooner. 

If you think you have ADHD you owe it to yourself to get checked out. Don't self-diagnose, but DO go to a professional. Preferably a psychiatrist who specializes in ADHD. If you have a condition you have to know it to manage it. Living undiagnosed is... hard.","gj43pmt",1,1610547455,"2021-01-13 14:17:35"

"6735","Hey! Thanks for sharing, I think a lot of people here will have been through similar struggles - you're not alone. I know I have often felt worthless as a result of taking setbacks very seriously and personally. Knowing people disapprove of me is something I find very difficult to put up with, so I have subconsciously learned to become a people-pleaser. But that approach is actually very damaging too, because you end up making sure others are happy instead of looking after yourself first. I have started to recognise that and I'm trying to make some changes.

It's been interesting to me to find out about the emotional aspects of life with ADHD - I always just thought I was an over-sensitive person, but some research suggests that emotional challenges are actually part and parcel of the ADHD experience. (If you google, you'll find a few articles about ""rejection sensitive dysphoria"" by William Dodson, which might offer a new perspective for you.)

You are not alone and there is help out there. You've taken the first step by asking for some advice in this forum. I'd also recommend some self-help (there are many good books out there that explain the ADHD diagnosis and the challenges we face). Also if you are feeling low, I would really recommend that you seek some professional help from a doctor or psychiatrist. Therapy like CBT or DBT might help you to transform some of your thoughts and allow you to see yourself with more compassion.

You don't need to punish yourself, it will not help. The main thing is to be compassionate to yourself, and try to build upon your own self-worth, irrespective of ""performance"" or achievements. Life is all about how you see it, and because you've taken the first step, you now have a great chance to get a new positive perspective on yours.","dir12yb",8,1497178207,"2017-06-11 10:50:07"

"6743","Yeezus, I realized I sucked at life I was your age. It's now 20+ years later and I am only starting to consider the idea that maybe I don't suck at life. 

My point is: life does already a good job giving us beat downs, the #1 thing you are responsible for is to NOT beat yourself up. 

Focus on that. Doesn't matter what happens, how much you fail, focus all your energy on not beating yourself up and on seeing the things you are brilliant at, and do better than most. Doesn't matter if society thinks it's less useful. You will get to a point where you realize everyone sucks more or less, even your role models, and that's ok. You will also realize as you grow older and travel, meet more people, try different jobs/roles, that there's actually a whole bunch of things about you that make you special in a very positive way. But you won't see it if you're all about how much you suck. 

It's ok to feel like you failed or be upset at yourself or be frustrated you're not delivering at the level you know you can. Just don't beat yourself up about it. It's a bigger deal to build up self esteem and self love, than it is to not fail at life. You can have a life full of failures and be tremendously happy, if you love yourself. Sorry it's going to the mooshy  side but this stuff is critical to getting you to being happy and enjoy life how it is. ","d7jdmat",3,1473675323,"2016-09-12 10:15:23"

"6773","It depends on whether it has to do with my money situation; if it was money, I have something along the lines of an anxiety reaction, the worst of which could get me to panic attack mode (it's been a long time now since that fortunately). Otherwise, I usually got into some combination of grumpy or frustrated or discouraged, all of which usually devolved into me taking a nap to try to reset my emotional state, after which I would proceed to ignore the problem until it became urgent or went away.

So far on medication I've had nothing surprise me, at least not in a negative way (I got a small promotion at work that I feel like I bombed the interview for, which was nice). I HAVE approached some tasks that before would have been very difficult to even start, and I've had success making things happen; I used to have a difficult time making calls, especially for businessy things like doctor appointments or changing details on an account or stuff like that, but this week I've been hopping on and off the phone calling people about my student loans, as an example, which has probably been the single biggest source of stress and anxiety for me for the last several years. It's not even that big of a loan, and making payments on it isn't much of a stretch financially if I'm careful, but just the idea that I owe someone thousands of dollars was so daunting to think about I couldn't handle dealing with it properly.

Probably to also assess my tolerance i'm sure.

Honestly, there's not a doubt in my mind that he said that, the RN was in the room also. They both told me that i would be out of pills when i came back for my check up.

I tried to go without meds for a long time but I was unable to get ahead because of what you are describing. I have about 100 half started projects that will probably just sit there .....now I can finish 80% of my projects and am actually getting ahead (slowly) in the art world (in my community). 

I would suggest talking to your doc about different new options in meds. Do you exercise? That is the biggest help for our brain (if you can make yourself do it). There are also ADHD specialists that can help you modify and adjust your behavior to make things easier.

At home, I get told how to do something (by my wife) to the deepest minutia and it's very frustrating.  It's usually caretaking stuff like dressing the kids, and she feels like she is helping by telling me exactly what to do every step of the way.   The problem is, when someone asks you to do something they themselves could do ""better"", there is this tendency to be overly helpful, which ends up being fisrespectful.  Plus, it denies the person the ability to learn how to do it right by just having them act like robots instead of engaging.  It's a terrible thing to do to someone,  but it's so easy to do because you're just being helpful.

The other problem is that OHIP only covers psychiatrists and not other kinds of mental health workers.  Just adding more psychiatrists so people can access drugs more easily isn't the answer either -- has to be complimented with increasing access to therapists who can talk to you about your issues and work on you with strategies to manage them, because as we all know, pills aren't a magic bullet.

"6828","I’ve described it to my friends as basically, it felt like I was drunk for the past two years and I just sobered up one day and saw real life. I constantly go into autopilot through out my life and it doesn’t feel like I control anything. This recently just happened to me on Monday when I got fired. I am usually in autopilot mode until I get my world turned upside down. And then I come to fruition. 
This is an okay explanation but there’s some way I want to explain this or describe it to my therapist and friends and family. But I really don’t know the words to use or what to say. I’m not going to lie I feel like a lot of it is trauma related for most people. And I would say another big contributor to this effect are cellphones and social media apps. But I can never find the words to ask for help and make sense. 
I relate this a lot to how I hear dissociation used in diagnosis’s. 
My girlfriend the other day brought me a point that for some reason made so much sense at the time. But each tip I ever get towards this autopilot sensation goes in my back up memory and then it’s deleted after a week. I don’t know how to retain my reality. 

Sorry I rambled there for a minute but I completely get it. The only thing I can say Is be safe. It started out small I would just forget what I was doing or where I was at or my task at hand. But it escalated until I literally fell asleep for a couple years. I walked through life “more like stumbled” and now I have opened my eyes up again. And I realize I haven’t been present in so long. Be safe, if you feel yourself slipping please ask for help, it doesn’t matter if you ramble or think you sound stupid find a therapist or doctor and spill it all out.

"6835","Story of my life. Things got A LOT easier when I stopped trying to have a job in customer service. I was a server for 5 months and was always messing something up. If you like being a server, try catering or working at a private club. No day is ever the same and people are constantly messing up so the times you do dont seem as bad. That being said, even though I was never fired, my bosses were Aholes and the verbal abuse was too much for tiny mistakes, the nature of temporary work like that is very stressful. 

I have found working in private child care to be the best for me. I used care.com and found 2 families to work for. I was able to set my own schedule, I have 2 mornings a week off, and they are crazy flexible if I need time off last minute. Not all families have this flexibility but some do. 

Idk if your a boy or girl but both sexes are in constant demand. I fucked up big with my first family and was fired, but I found a new family almost immediately again and was never held back by my last fuck up. 

Kids think just like my ADHD brain so to them I'm awesome and random just like them. If I call out sick, they are glad that I'm not exposing their kids to germs. At times of big struggle personally, I can reduce my hours to work less and when I'm doing better I can work more hours. 

Don't feel like you have to work a certain type of job, there are so many opportunities out there that can be best for you. You could work nights at a dog kennel. Don't be afraid to work 2 different part time jobs, having something different to be doing is a great way to allow your ADHD brain to go different directions because it needs to do that!!

Good luck, I know it's not easy and being fired feels horrible. You just haven't found the right type of work, but it is out there!!! Keep looking and keep trying!

TL;DR: it's not all bad, just lots of it. Find the good stuff and try to focus on that. 

The bad comes with *some* good. That's the way I prefer to look at it.

 There are plenty of disorders and conditions out there that don't have an upside. Of any kind. We got, a little luckier on the genetic draw. 

It's not a superpower, and it can make some things hell. 30 odd years of depression and anxiety, no career movment and no relationships prove it's a disability, for the most part. 

But I also like my hyper focus moments, I like the life expeince of a million hobbies and careers, I like my ability to think outside the box and problem solve in a crises.

 I'd probably take a normally functions brain if I could swap still. I've dived head first into meds for a reason .  But I'm stuck with what I've got so I might as well try to make the best of it. 

I must say as well that getting diagnosed and being able to differentiate what I can and can not control. And how to cope with things such as time blindness and object permanence. Has made the good sides, more fun and I owe that to this sub.","g7ulugo",0,1601945423,"2020-10-06 00:50:23"

Also, carbohydrates are used for building muscle, despite the popular myth that all you need is massive loads of protein to get buff.

What I am discovering, for myself, is that I do well when I get the right amount as well as the right *kind* of carbs.  I may have a gluten allergy and I do better when I avoid it.

"6868","It is hard to pick up study habits and life skills. I have had the depression for so long that I don't know it any other way. Something that has really helped me lately is being able to take a step back and look at everything around me. This allows me to take in my situation and while I feel it's terrible or the end of the world, I am able to look at it from how someone else would see it. It helps me to see that everything really is not as bad as it seems. Sure, it may be bad, but it could always be worse. And I try to remember that even if I don't know it, there is always someone who does have it worse than me but is not letting their situation get to them as much as I let mine get to me, so I should try to take it for what it is. Think about what you do have and try not to focus on the negatives. It's really hard, I know. I really do. But trust me that it will get easier with time. 

I'll try to lay out my study habits and such, but I still have really poor ones. I have a tutor for one of my classes who I met with twice a week to have lecture notes explained and the homework explained. I try to sit down every afternoon (not at night because my focus does not last much past 7 pm) and force myself to do what I need to get done. I am also a lot more motivated because I did fail out, so I know that if I fail again I am done and I have used my second chance already. As for you, I would think about all that you hope to accomplish, what you want to achieve, and who you want to be. By knowing where you are trying to go, it may make it easier to get through what has to be done now. I know homework and studying is not fun and may not seem worth it, but doing so will allow you to the grades, to stay in school, and to ultimately graduate, and then to become successful in whatever your chosen field was.  

I know some of this sounds like it's from a book or what everyone says, but it's the little things that do make it easier and at least help me to see that the time and effort I put in now, even when I feel like it doesn't matter and there is no reason to, is going to help me become the best person and computer programmer that I can be. I think that should cover most, if I think of anything I missed, I'll post again. ","c3uo9dr",1,1330119415,"2012-02-24 21:36:55"

Sleep is definitely king. Losing sleep is like kicking my brain with a steel-toed boot.

Meditation “works” but you have to actually apply the meditative mindset consciously while working on a task. I find it doesn’t generally transfer as a skill unless I devote attention to it and say “I’m going to notice every time my attention wavers on this task, just like I do when I’m focusing on my breath.” Without that intention (remembering to apply the intention is a thing I forget to do), I don’t find meditation to be helpful.

Fasting also works. If i have a lot to do during a day, I won’t eat until dinner. Something about the quality of being hungry helps me focus.

Low carbohydrate / ketosis diet was helpful for me after the first few weeks. I did notice a general smoothening of mental energy. It’s socially restrictive and somewhat unpleasant to do, so I don’t maintain it. It did work though.

Brain training is of limited usefulness, similar to meditation. You have to actually search the task you’re doing for points of connection and how it’s similar to the game you’ve been practicing, and consciously apply the skills from the game to your task.

I'm more of the inattentive type ADHD--dont display hyperactivity externally quite as much--but I've wondered how much of that has been because of anxiety. When I was a very young child, probably 9 and younger, I was actually quite hyperactive. I got in trouble a lot for talking constantly, fidgeting constantly, moving around constantly. But mostly talking. Saying everything that came to my mind.

Didn't take long for me to start feeling like no one actually wanted to hear me talk anymore, that I was annoying, said stupid things, and was generally a nuisance.

And then very quickly I went from the talkative kid to someone that everyone in my graduating class probably remembers as the shy, quiet person who keeps her head down and stays out of the way.

Heh... rather raw to think about. But an important one. Wish I could offer some advice--but all I got for now is to say I relate and understand, in as much as I can.","gdqrct6",1,1606458987,"2020-11-27 06:36:27"

No, sorry for you, but it's not an either I'm bad at math or I'm asking a rhetorical question situation, simply because you want to try shining a negative light on me.

So forcing me to pick between your two extremes to change the focus and make me (and yourself) forget that you tried to assume, based on nothing. 

I'm going to assume myself, and say, you're trying to play some kind of white knight. Probably in attempts to feel better about yourself, because, I'm sure you have done to another the act you're trying to project onto me, which would be 'asking an unnecessary, rhetorical question'.

I was asking because I don't like to assume, especially age wise, seeing as most people don't like the wrong age label (more so younger individuals), which can put up a wall quickly and prevent open communication.

You want to do the dishes because, although they aren't as important, they are *easier*. They require less forethought and planning, less to remember, and they are *physical and visible* so it's easier to pick up where you left off if you get distracted (which you will).

Take meds, break tasks down (not mentally, no, instead break it down on a pad of paper), and remember that those pesky dishes will still be dirty later so there's no sense in fretting about them now. Treat the dishes as a reward you *get* to check off after you get started on work. Write shit down because it's externalizes your memory so when you inevitably forget you'll at least have a list. Don't put it in some app you'll never check or a notebook you'll never open, put it on a pad of legal paper on your desk and everyday you get to throw away today's page! If you didn't complete something, transfer it into tomorrow's page so you can still throw away today's page!

"6930","Sounds like most people with ADHD. It's quite obvious he still has a fair amount of growing up to do, but that's expected at his age. People with ADHD mature later.

Now imagine this: How do you think it feels to be unable to control yourself in this way? I guarantee you he understands completely what the consequences of all of these small (and sometimes big) failures are for him and the people around him. It hits him more hard than you can ever imagine. In fact, I'm fairly sure gets pretty depressed about it.

Because it doesn't matter how aware you are, you still can't fight the disorder by trying harder. It just doesn't work that way, and you need to understand that.

With time he'll realize that he can make up for some of the problems with good habits and routines, and that sleeping and eating schedules are good. Exercise helps a lot too. He needs to be considering a life that pretty much is the same every day, because few things make people with ADHD work optimally as that. We may crave a life with much daily change, but ultimately it makes the ADHD worse.

You need to consider if you're willing to see things from his perspective too. Having ADHD is much like missing your legs in the sense that it's not your fault that you can't do certain things. The sooner you understand that he can't help it and that it tears him apart, the sooner you have a chance of a good relationship. He can absolutely be great but on his own terms, not on yours. You need to change your expectations, and be more understanding.

If you don't think you are willing or able to do this, then you should seriously consider if this relationship is right for the both of you.","cqbsk7n",2,1429000070,"2015-04-14 08:27:50"

For extracurriculars I’m trying to get involved with two clubs, Engineers Without Borders and the Steel Bridge Team.

As for studying my problem is largely that I just can’t gauge how much I should study.

When I talked to my doctor about it he said either 1)my dosage is too low or 2)for the first time my brain isn’t constantly going and it’s being perceived as being tired. 
I’m not good at explaining it but you know when you adhd is untreated and running rampant your brain is constantly running, it’s always running and rarely stops on anything. But when you take meds that “stops”. Or it finally has the ability to stop on one thing and push other stuff away And you start processing things more and that seems slow. 

But as for the spacing out, that’s not too much of an issue. Meds don’t miraculously make you do things and anyone who says it does does not have ADHD. Even when I take my meds I still need to make sure I know what I need to do or I will waste my day scrolling reddit/twitter or doing nothing at all. Meds can help you by giving you the ability to focus for an extended time but it won’t give you the will to do things.

Living without medication works for some, but if your brain is just a bit broken, or if it's shaped in a way that just can't work with society as-is, you'll need to make a hard decision.

If you're an adult now, get back on some kind of ADHD medication and *manage your diet*, force yourself to eat well.

There are numerous medications of various sorts, and many techniques an adult can use to support the meds.

It can be the silliest tasks, but it feels like the information needs to go thoroughly sirup to be processed(usually school-related). 

I've been trying to implement the follow things, and they seem to work when I remember to do them
- eat more/better. I usually try to have a bag of raw cashews or other nuts with me. They are energy-dense, so they fill you up. 

- drink more water. 
Sugary drinks can also be useful if you have low blood sugar, and only need a half hour or so boost before dinner/whatever

- keep an eye on how much I sleep. I find that brain fog comes easier when sleep deprived 

- drink coffee to see if that helps. Sometimes it does. 

-exercise. 

- get up and walk. Get some fresh air, maybe talk to someone. 

-switch task. Either to something related, or to something completely different. I find that when I go back, I can focus in a different way than when I got stuck. Especially if I do something similar, but more basic.

"6998","I spoke with my psychologist about this recently as I have very similar struggles in social situations. She explained that the executive functioning that covers both emotional regulation and impulse regulation is affected by my ADHD. I found that whenever I was drinking I would always say ""dumb"" things, like things that came out meaner than they were meant or were inappropriate for the context, but were the first things that popped into my head so I would just blurt them out without being able to consider it before I spoke it. I stopped drinking for a few months, and recently went out socially while sober for a very long day, and was disheartened when I managed to still offend and insult someone by misreading the social cues and pushing a topic that was inappropriate for that context (that I did not realize at the time). I told myself that I was just a bad person and can't socialize like everyone else, and I would feel exhausted trying to ""keep up"" with over analyzing social situations then mentally beating myself up over it afterwards like ""Why did I say that? I wish I said this instead!"".   


She explained that emotional stress, fatigue, and alcohol all reduce my ADHD executive functioning ability to filter and inhibit impulsive speech. She said that being aware of what affects your own functioning is helpful to plan ways to compensate for the filtering that (as it appears to me) everyone around me is doing easily and without even being aware of it.  


She suggested that I try and avoid socializing if I know I am particularly tired or inhibited, or if that isn't possible to be around people who know and love me and are willing to understand if I say something that doesn't come out the way I intend or if I am exhibiting particular traits that day, to be aware of the conversation that is happening and try and avoid talking during ""dangerous"" topics that have potential to be inflammatory (take sips of water, eat slowly so my mouth is full) and then chip in again when a safer topic comes around that I know I can safely contribute to. But also to accept that no one is perfect and we are all going to put our foot in out mouth sometimes no matter how our brains work.   


It was helpful to talk about this with her because it allowed me to change my narrative from ""I don't like the person I am when I drink / I am not a person who can socialize well"" which is shame based and negative self-talk to ""I know that alcohol affects my executive functioning so I can choose when and how to drink it with more awareness"" and ""I understand that socializing is an area I can look at improving in"" which reflects my deficits and my strengths and removes judgement as me as a person from the narrative which I think is a more healthy and balanced self-talk narrative.","g2v64vf",2,1598405447,"2020-08-26 01:30:47"

"7004","Eh. I enjoy some aspects of it and it is a plus in some situations, but the exact same symptoms can either be enjoyable/beneficial or unpleasant/detrimental depending on the context, my overall mental state, etc.

Like...noticing *everything* can be really useful, but that inability to tune out irrelevant stimuli is a big part of why I couldn't handle driving until I was \~25 and every car I own ends up looking like something out of a demolition derby. Hyperactivity comes in handy when I'm watching my relatives' kids, but it also makes me impatient and easily distracted, resulting in multiple kitchen fires from leaving the stove unattended. Hyperfocus is great when I'm working on a project, but not when I break a toe every few years because I'm too absorbed in something to watch where I'm going. And on and on.

She's still wanting to see me (I don't see my mother much) to know more, especially how I am finding it now being medicated, I've had a brief chat with her (on Allo) with a brief summary.

the group i'm with isn't actually a performing improv group so much as a mixed bag of folks with different skill levels that meets up once a week to play games and run scenes-- they call it an open jam. it's always lead by someone who's on the more advanced end of things. but like the first time i came to the jam i was like, ""hi, i've never done improv, but i listen to a lot of podcasts about it and i love to watch it so i know a lot of the basic rules."" and the woman leading the jam was totally cool and explained things when i needed. at the end of the jam, we always sit and talk about scenes we liked and our own scenes we felt good about. so far it's a really nice environment. i'm not sure how common that kind of thing is tho. 

lately, i haven't been bc of school and work and the group is on hiatus while we find a new space to meet, but i was getting pretty good, i think. before i stepped away, my biggest struggle was with starting scenes. i freeze up a lot and i also was starting to work so hard concentrating on what other people are doing that i forget to come up with my own stuff.

I used to say I didn’t have ADHD, I have an impulsive control disorder. But that doesn’t cover the emotionally-heightened responses and other aspects of having low dopamine activity where I need it in my brain. 

I feel like we should change the name but I also want to preserve something reminiscent of ADHD so people within our community and the medical community will know how what we’re talking about.

Anemic dopamine nervous system (ADNS)
Anemic dopamine executive function disorder (ADEFD)
Abortive Dopamine Response Disorder (ADRD)

"7021","Sweetie, here's a big warm hug!    I totally remember back when I was diagnosed, it was a relief but also kind of a shock.    When I started taking Adderall a week later, the weirdest thing was I kept feeling like I must have forgotten to do something because I had all this extra time on my hands.   Turns out, I just had to get used to NOT double and triple-checking everything like I used to.   You're doing great!    Getting diagnosed is a very big step and definitely can be overwhelming at first.    Here's something that will help--see if your library has ""Taking Charge of Adult ADD"" by Russell A. Barkley, and ask the librarian to look up more books about adult ADD for you.  

And, of course, know that we're all cheering for you and you can ask literally anything.    There is no such thing as a silly question, the only silly question is the one you don't ask.   ""How to stop leaving things on top of my car and then driving away?""  is an example of a perfectly reasonable question around here.   P.S.  About medication:   Remember that you can always choose to take it only sometimes, like for school or work, especially with an IR (instant release, v XR=eXtended release) formula.  And you can try out different medications until you find what you're comfortable with.  Medications can change over time, and they are a tool for you to use--a tool you can use to help you with your challenges in your life.   You control your medication, your medication doesn't control you.

"7033","Ugh. I know where you're at. It sucks. I was there for years.

First question. Do you have meds? If no, get them. Asap. They have been life changing.

Otherwise, something I only realised this year, once I already had med, a stable job etc, but would have been amazing before, is: work on your communication and relationship building skills. They are transferable to EVERYTHING. If you don't know where you're going or what you want to do, work on things that will be useful everywhere. You can treat every interaction as a chance to do this... Because it is, you build relationships with every interaction you have with people.

Next thing I found helpful is to not be hard on yourself, your a person, you'll fuck up, you'll drop the ball, it happens. Just try not to go backwards. Start small and try and move forward, whether it's in building a skill or habit... It doesn't matter if you're getting better slowly, as long as you're getting better by some amount, you're moving in the right direction, you don't have to do everything all at once. Life is pretty long, you'd be surprised where you're at in a year after a bunch of tiny improvements.

As for the drinking... I don't really have any good advice that you don't already know. My drug of choice was/is (thankfully?) cannabis, I had the same issues minus the worry of physical addiction/alcohol related issues.

But i’m also brutally honest, “I’m sorry, I don’t really have an appropriate response.” or “I appreciate your excitement in this topic, but I don’t think i’m able to provide you with the banter you’re looking for.” Or better yet, just keep asking them questions over and over again on the topic until they bore themselves. 

When I am interested in a topic, I simply say “please give me a second to gather my thoughts.” It’s okay to force yourself to slow down and think. 

It’s important to be patient with yourself and not be over zealous or equally cold towards others. When you’re impatient with yourself (like I get when this happens) people can read that. You’re not a victim.

"7105","I'm sorry to say this, but it sounds like Adderall isn't the right med for you. In any case, had it been me going through the side effects you've been experiencing, that's what I would've concluded, especially considering that you haven't seen much improvement of you ADHD symptoms. 

If you decide to continue your med trial on Adderall, I wouldn't recommend asking your doctor for IR tablets for the evening. You're still experiencing significant side effects, with not much benefits, and adding an IR tablet will only prolong the side effects well into the evening. 

If you decide to ask your doctor for another medication, I also wouldn't recommend starting at a higher dose that the smallest one possible. The goal of the titration process is to find the lowest possible dose at which you get enough benefits for as little side effects as possible.

I'll take Concerta as an exemple, as it's the one I'm most familiar with in terms of dosage. The lowest dose is 18mg and it's where you're meant to start your trial. Now, barely anyone will experience any benefit at this dose, but you can experience side effects. Depending on the side effects you are experiencing, it can tell you and your doctor if it's worth continuing on this medication or not. As the pharmacist explained to me when I started my medication, you usually need to wait 7 to 10 days before tapering up to the next dose. The effects you feel for the first few days at a new dose are often more important than what they will be over the long term, and they stabilize after that period. So, after 7 days, you have a good idea how things will be.

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever you and your doctor decide to do, keep taking notes! They provide you with great data to make an informed decision. 

On a side note, and from personal experience, what I can tell you is that the right medication should make you feel like yourself, without much difference except improvement in your symptoms. I can't quite find the right words to explain it, but I know that on Concerta, I feel comfortable in my brain...On Vyvance, there's something not quite comfortable in my brain.

* break up with your girlfriend- it might be the solution, at this point you can't trust her with your meds and you said its stressing you out.    
* get your girlfriend help, counseling, NA, rehab, whatever fits  
* get a lock box and put the meds in there  
* put a note on your medicine bottle for your girlfriend, telling her that shes better than this   
* don't invite your girlfriend over anymore  
* tell her next time that you will report them stolen the next time she takes them and then do it  
&gt; I know that it is my fault for not taking the proper precautions to keep this from happening. 
 
* thats what people in abusive relationships say all the time. If you arn't leaving your meds in the open then it's not your fault and you just need to hang out with better people  


personally i think you should rethink your relationship with your girlfriend. This isn't good for your mental health and like you mentioned you have tried confronting her and nothing has changed. 

edit: i noticed your girlfriend might not be the only one taking it.

"7172","Here is what worked for me as a kid (and as an adult) that I wished the adults in my mind had understood.

Work with him. Side by side if need be when its bad. Encourage him. Make him accountable to you, but in a pride aspect, not a punishment one. And by that I don't mean withhold your pride in him. Always show your are proud of him. But make him want to make you more proud. Him showing you him succeeding, as he does it, keeps his mind engaged and fuels that little dopamine center he's got issues with. He's saying he's stupid. That is more than enough to show you that HE KNOWS He is having issues and that he is more than capable of dealing out his own self punishment most of the time and he doesn't need you reinforcing that. In fact, most of us ADHDers have an overdeveloped punishment cycle and an underdeveloped reward cycle. Try to compensate on the other end.

Talk to him about an incentive plan. Help him pick a series of rewards for accomplishments like chores and homework and school behavior. Talk him more into withholding rewards for poor performance and getting them for good performance. Try to steer him away from punishments for poor performance, even if he chooses them. Set up a well defined plan with microrewards, like ice cream or movie binge for day to day performance and bigger rewards for longer term or milestones. MAKE SURE that they are his rewards, not yours. He probably hyperfocuses so things that might seem dumb could very possibly be HUGE for him because he's fixated on them and they are spewing dopamine. And you can hardly get too granular with them here. Think of them like liver treats when teaching a dog a trick. You give one at EVERY sign of progress because compared to a normal human the dog has a very poor executive function system and needs constant reward. So do we.

Once you have the plan in place, DO NOT CHEAT. You need to maintain his trust that the plan is sacred. That's the only thing he's got holding himself on track and developing his artificial mental reward path and he must trust it and you. It doesn't matter if he got in 2 fistfight today, and was suspended from school for smoking pot, if the deal was he cleaned his room he gets that reward, then you dann well better give him his reward for cleaning his room. That was the deal and the other stuff needs to be dealt with seperately. Don't you dare go back on your deal. In fact, that room clean was an act of love and him going out on a limb begging you to show that you are a solid foundation of structure he can trust even when he's feeling like a total failure. He needs it then more than ever.

Regularly revisit the plan to see what is working and what isn't. What he wanted as rewards last month may not work for him this month. Iterate and improve it over time. But let him define it, not you. He will be invested in something he owns, not something forced on him. 

When you Fuck up in the deal, and you will, be open and honest and apologize and make up for it. Don't be stubborn and try to act like you didn't Fuck up. He knows you did. If you own it he'll forgive you. If you don't he may bail on your agreement altogether.

And remind him constantly of his reward when you see him deviate. Its tough for him to keep the reward in mind. ""Finish so you can have ice cream tonight"" is a gentle reminder that places the goal back into his conscious mind so he can go a bit further.

And understand its hard for you and a hell of a lot of work. Its even more work for him though. There is no magic thing you can do to make it easy. He is severely impaired in his ability to follow through with his plans. He forgets there IS a plan constantly, not because its not dreadfully important to him, but because it simply does not exist in his short term memory. That is not his fault and it has no moral implication. He is not morally deficient and he wants to do good, he just needs a lot more skills in order to do so than other people and together you can work to develop those.

And win he does win a big milestone, celebrate with him like there is no tomorrow. And help him feel comfortable in celebration. He's probably way more comfortable with self flagellation and may be embarrassed and feel unworthy with celebration.","e5y9599",6,1536903572,"2018-09-14 05:39:32"

"7183","Okay, so a bullet journal is where you create your own planner. It sounds scary AF. But once you get the hang of it, it's amazing, because it's completely 100% tailored to *your* unique needs. 

You use a blank notebook, get a few ideas from the internet about basic structure and you're ready to get started. 

That's the foundation, from there you build it into a custom made master piece. **Now I'll tell you my best tips, and the tools that I use for mine** You can use any notebook or loose leaf/binder system, this is just what I personally like to use and how I like to use it. 

1) I personally like to use a **disk bound note taking system** I use the TUL system. I'm from the US and I get these at Office Depot, but it looks like you can get the exact same thing in the UK through Staples? I'm not positive, but I'll provide the link below. 

I like this system because it allows you:

-To move pages to any part of the notebook cleanly and seamlessly

-There are various inserts to help divide and organize your planner (Page markers, pocketed dividers, color coded tab dividers, rulers etc)

-They offer smooth functionality

-You can find page refills with a variety of formatting (single lined, graphing paper, days of the week)

-There is also a special hole punch you can get to make any paper work with your planner

-You can see all of this in the link I provided. 

2) It can seem overwhelming to decide how to structure and organize your bullet journal, my best advice is to get some ideas about organization from the internet, but remember that the possibilities lie within your imagination and your own routine. 

I started my bullet journal very simply, with a few whole months written out, a few pages of ""index"" with important static bits of information, phone numbers, recurring yearly events such as birthdays etc. 

Then I carried it with me every single day and started to hone in on what was most important to me. I made sections that fit my needs and I ended up with 4 basic parts to my planner: Index, Monthly, Weekly and Daily, I only do the daily part a few days at a time and use as an entire page for each day, broken down sorta like a Panda Planner, but much simpler at the same time. 

I bought ruler inserts to mark immediately-relevant-to-my-day-pages and colored tab inserts to mark the different sections. 

It would be very easy to incorporate separate sections for work vs. social life. 

**keep it simple and don't try too hard** let your life and work flow dictate how you set it up, always remembering that this is to make your life easier, never try to be elaborate, that's why it's called a ""bullet"" journal. Short and to the point. Also don't try to sit down and ""make"" a whole planner in one sitting, this is something that should develop with time. 

3) Don't get discouraged if you let it slide for a few days or feel like you have dropped the ball. I think this goes for any planner, you have to accept that this is new and you have to practice to get good at it. In addition to that, you have to look at it like exercise or eating healthy, it's not the most exciting thing to do, in fact, you'd rather not do it, but the benefits are worth reaping. 

That's the beauty of the Bullet Journal and the Panda Planner, there are no pre-printed dates in there, so you can miss a few days, and pick up right on the next page. No big empty gaps glaring at you, reminding you of your failure. 

4) I kind of already touched on this, but look at other planners for ideas on what might interest you in a planner. You can just recreate that in your own planner. 


Okay those are my biggest tips. You probably think I'm a nut bag now for typing all this out. OR maybe it's normal around here. IDK. 
**Here are the links I promised.** 

**The original Bullet Journal** please read the whole website, it's small and to the point, but it's worth seeing the most basic structures and their simplicity outlined for you.

Hours and hours later my mom showed up at work, informed me that I had left him out there, in the snow. I forgot to let him back in. Animal control was called. They gave us back my puppers (his paws got cold but he was all okay), but charged my mom (who had nothing to do with it, but I was 16) with animal cruelty. Jesus, we spoil our pets and treat them better than humans. I LOVE animals. How could I have done this?

She understandably had me come to court and stand with her. It was just a small fee and my puppers is growing old with me, spoiled and happy, but I don't think there has ever been a moment when I was more ashamed.

"7206","Yes, I don't disagree with any of that. And yes, the spirit of that comment was clearly intended with more compassion than I perhaps reflected in my subsequent comment. 

I myself though have had a very recent diagnosis (51M) and although it's only been three months since then, I've used the interim time presented during lockdown to dig as deep as I can into the condition. I'm certainly not an expert, and do realise that there are a lot of what we currently think of as co-morbities crssoing over, and that ADHD itself is an umbrella term covering a range of issues that not evrybody shares. And so, yes, the labels are a little lacking in that regard. I've also been battling with whether this ADHD thing is 'real' (in the sense you intimate, if I've understood you correctly that is) but the more I read the more I see that my litany of failures are almost textbook in the way they've played out, and any attempts at getting help have proved fruitless because the baseline diagnosis wasn't there. For example, with 'perfectionism' the routes to redress that life-inhibiting (in very real and costly ways in my case) tendency have never worked for me. Finding out about it within the context of ADHD however has been a revelation, and led to deal with far deeper, seemingly unrelated, issues that are having a much wider effect in how I operate in general. 

So in that context, having a label, or a framework within which I can work from, has been invaluable. Using that framework for the first time in my life I can see there are tools available that directly benefit and I'm already seeing changes as a result of that.","ft3lt55",2,1591440055,"2020-06-06 10:40:55"

Remember, just because thoughts go through your head, that does not mean those thoughts are true or accurate. Depression and anxiety are ugly liars and ADHD can lead to both of those symptoms. 

Meditation does help train how to push those ugly thoughts away - I am a skeptical person and it took me a while to try these techniques, but in the time you take to worry, look it up, research it.

"7226","(Sorry this ended up super long!)

I was diagnosed and started medication at 9 years old, so I don't remember a lot of details (I am now a few weeks away from 20). What I do remember is being frustrated a lot. I remember my mother making me sit down at the kitchen table and telling me I *had* to do my homework. As soon as she left I put my head down on the table and started kicking my legs and day dreaming. And she came back later and yelled at me for not working and I got so frustrated because it was like I *couldn't* work on it. It felt like there was a physical wall in my head that kept me from being able to concentrate on it. I remember that she started sitting with me at the table and every time my attention started wandering she would pull me back to the work. And this would go on late into the night. I remember being so frustrated because she kept pulling me back but I physically *couldn't* do it, I couldn't concentrate. I remember crying a lot during those sessions. I remember mom getting frustrated and yelling and giving up. But in class it wasn't so bad. (I know now that that's because I was doing homework after class, when my adhd batteries were fully drained and we didn't know how to refill them, but in class my batteries were full). In class I really didn't realize anything was wrong until someone scolded me. I read a lot. I started hiding the book under my desk because the teacher kept getting angry with me. I talked all the time to the people at my table. I thought they were my friends and it devastated me when my teacher pulled me aside and told me that she had been getting complaints from my table mates about how annoying I was. Apparently I literally never shut up and I was always talking to them when they were trying to work. They also complained about me constantly moving and fidgeting. But I didn't realize anything was wrong with my brain. I was just so *bored* in classes, all the time. The work was boring and I would rather read, so I did. And the homework was hard and I would rather play, so I did. I got in trouble all the time. It kicked in at age 7, and I was convinced my 3rd grade teacher hated me. I couldn't understand why she was always angry with me and punishing me. I thought the same of my 4th grade teacher. She was so frustrated with me that she got nasty, and that just confirmed to me that she was just a mean old lady. I didn't understand why all the other students liked such a mean teacher. I didn't understand that it was me who had the problem, I just thought the work was hard and boring and the teacher was mean. At times I felt stupid, because all the other kids were getting their work done. They didn't think it was as hard as I did. All my previous classes had been easy, so I thought either the work was hard or I was stupid. It was confusing. I didn't know that my ADHD had developed and that was why everything was hard.

And then I got the diagnosis. A family friend recognized the symptoms and told my mom to get me tested. So she did, and I got medicated. And it was incredible. Things weren't hard anymore! Things weren't boring anymore! My teacher was nice to me! My friends were nice to me! I didn't read anymore. I waited until recesses or break or after I had finished my work. I didn't get in trouble. I started making more friends. I joined a group of girls and sang in front of the classroom. The song was about *how much we loved our teacher!* Just weeks ago I thought of her as a devil woman! And then I realized that the problem had been with me all along. I cried then. It hurt realizing that and it took a few years to adjust to the idea. But god, school was great now! I blew through my work. I had tons of extra time because I got everything done so fast. I rarely had to take home homework because I would get it all done at school. Things weren't so good at home, but school was amazing! It was like being in Antarctica for years and then someone moves you to Tahiti! Things weren't perfect, and I still have to work at it, but I can only imagine what my life would be like if I was never diagnosed. I probably would have abandoned school entirely.","d9eb75e",3,1477856451,"2016-10-30 19:40:51"

"7228","Personally, it infuriates the crap out of me.

It IS a contributor to the static you end up getting from Doctors...  I've been on meds for over 20 years, so with the levels of tolerance I've built up, I have to be VERY careful with switching physicians.  I basically have to pre-screen physicians to weed out the ones who are liable to flip out and try to kill me.  Ever had an involuntary dose cut from 100mg a day to 30mg a day?  I have, and let me tell you, the suffering is not something I would wish on my most loathed enemy. 

There is NO reason to try to dope on ADHD drugs.  None.  If you don't get something, the stims won't make it click.  Take a nap.  Work on lucid dreaming, do ANYTHING else.  But DON'T risk screwing over your brain chemistry.  

Remember, your body perfectly tunes itself to it's environment to the extent your genetics allow.  If you don't need the drug, you are only messing with how your own genes and new neurons develop.  Your life WILL end up revolving around the damn drug.  I would give  just about ANYTHING to be able to be fully ""there"" for my loved ones all the time.

"7244","Proper treatment is not just medication alone, but having a healthy life style. Sleeping correctly, eating correctly, and writing down your activities out for the day all goes with being treated. Medication may be needed yes, but he also needs to work on himself on a day to day basis.

Will this cure him and make him all better? Never. This is something he will have to deal with his entire life. It should get a lot better for him yes, but you need to support him in getting treated. This isn't about him putting it off, but rather his prioritizes and motivation to do it is not on his ""things to do.""

Sorry to say but you may need to ""hand hold"" his hand in getting treated. Talk to him about it, make the calls needed, get the schedule up and take him there. Are you treating him like a child by doing this? Yes you are. He simply may be soooo far out of it he doesn't even have the level of awareness to realize how bad he is. You need to talk to him like an adult about this. Tell him you will help him get treated. You need to tell him how important this is to you and your family.

If you have a baby sitter have them sit your children while you talk to him. That way its just you and him and no side stress.

From past personal experiences, my ADHD was so bad that I just did what was in-front of me at that very moment. I did not think further ahead then 15 minutes. I always did everything last minutes and just did what ever when It came up. If he is like that right now... he may not be able to go and get treated on his own without you. Hes a gold fish right now. Being a gold fish sucks ass and he wants help... he just can't ask because he might feel very ashamed.

I don't want to defend him like I am... but... going through ADHD is very torturous for me sometimes. You have little control over your memory and its hard to make intention become actions. People on these forums fear... straight out FEAR if they suddenly stop treatment. Why? Because if they stop they fear they will forget to get it refilled again, forget to go to the doctor... stop eating correctly...

I will end this post with this: It is his responsibility to be accountable for himself. When you talk to him, be supportive that he needs treatment and be... nice. Don't yell at him about it... he won't want to do it. Talk to him and tell him how important this is too you. Be there for him about this. Show him how good and positive this will be for him.

If he still ignores your plea and supportive positivity.... then I can not defend him.


Talking to him about this might be very hard for you... helping him get treatment and being positive might be hard... but this is the only way that I can see things turning up.

"7246","This sounds exactly like me!! Before I got the ADHD diagnosis, I had psychologists come up with “perfectionism as part of anxiety, causing procrastination” as the closest diagnosis/description to being accurate IMO. Nobody really ever nailed it as I kept seeking help. Then I came across adult ADHD. Wow!!! And there it is! There’s my tribe! 

My hyperfocus on things that are useless to me but are really interesting, has probably caused me the most difficulty. I have a lot of report writing to do for work, and it is a CONSTANT battle for me. I don’t think medications help me with this part. In fact it might even make the hyperfocussing worse. I will spend hours, days, weeks writing a report that my colleagues would have finished in 40 minutes. Sometimes I just laugh and say, “Yeah but at the end of those weeks on my one report, I will have the best three sentences you have ever seen!”… But only three sentences.  Ugh. 

It does serve me though because it saves my ass all the time. At least now, I can power through what needs to get done at the last minute and be finished late.  I have extended it over three months one time when I was in big trouble with my taxes. Every day. All day. When I bothered to eat, it was in front of my computer. I did nothing but work on my taxes. Normal people can’t do this.

This was a real concern when I was considering meds. One psych said it would even me out more like normal ppl: no more procrastination but no more hyperfocus either. I declined, because I just can’t take the risk of losing that superpower. All that said, that psychiatrist wanted to diagnosed me with bipolar and put me on meds – and I wasn’t convinced it was the right diagnosis so was really resistant to trying the meds. He is also the psychiatrist who told me I could never have gone through grad school successfully, or do work the way I was describing hyperfocus if I had ADHD. 😒Eventually I found a psychiatrist familiar with adult ADHD.

"7256","Hey man i thought id chime in because I believe i have ADHD (test is next friday) and i have a problem with weed. Im a 21 yr old college student.

I thought weed was the greatest gift to man kind. I was the dude who believed in the whole ""study high, test high, grades high"" thing. I've posted on this very sub about using weed to treat ADHD. The last 6 months i have vaped weed at least once a day. I never thought of this as a problem because I was surrounded by college kids that wouod smoke and drink even more than me. I thought I was perfectly fine until i tried to cut back on my usage.

I realized weed was making me un-motivated and lazy during the week so i thought i'd try to cut back and stick to just the weekends. I couldn't do it. I had 2g of shatter and some weed lying around so it was readily available and the only thing I would think about when I had free time. 

Id get high as balls as soon as I was done with class on friday and keep at it until sunday night. I didn't do anything productive (no HW, no chores, no studying) all weekend long. And then i'd sleep through all my morning classes during the week and procrastinate on my HW. The 'haze' or 'muddled' feeling would suck during the week. I'd approach a deadline and not do a single oz of work. Then it would be midnight the night before it was due and id think ""fuck it, ill just get high and forget about it. I'll do the next HW early (yeah right)."" Then later in the week id think ""well I already got high once this week, might as well get high again and start next week (yeah right).""

I was stuck in that cycle of blowing stuff off and using weed to make me feel better about it for about a month. My grades suffered, my personal relationships suffered and I blew through all my cash. As long as I had weed in the house, I knew I couldn't control my usage. After a few more wake-up calls, I decided I needed to drop out and get my shit together.

I wasnt physically addicted, but I was mentally addicted to weed. I thought I needed it to get through my day. But I don't and neither do you. I realized that I can't use weed without abusing it. I wish I could just smoke a little weed on the weekends when I have free time and chill with my friends but i know deep down that if I do, I will feel like crap the next day and the temptation to get high all day everyday will return. 
 
Once I made up my mind I was going to quit, I dabbed the last of my concentrates and braced for the comedown. With the help of /r/leaves I'm trying to get a handle on my addiction and stay sober.

Weed itself wasn't the problem, it was the fact that anything I do, I have to turn it up to 11. I know some people can use weed responsibly and limit their intake. I can't. I have a very addictive personality and I realize that I can't control my impulses while high and I can't make myself be productive.

If anything I have said resonates with you I'd suggest checking out /r/leaves and doing some introspection.

If not, I suggest you keep a close eye on the amount and frequency of your use and make sure it isn't negatively affecting your life and make sure to stop your self before you get to that point.","cpe7v7t",1,1426291555,"2015-03-14 00:05:55"

I didn't have regular periods for eons, and I started taking inositol for giggles - turns out that helped manage my insulin, and whammo, periods almost regular for the first time in my adult life. It meant for the first time too I could track my symptoms. Over two years, I was dating two different men, and I would routinely want to break up with them in that three day period.

I started back up again because I quit smoking weed and needed an alternative. I'll probably start tapering again soon. 

When it comes to vape/juuls I feel like you're fighting two addictions. You're fighting the nicotine addiction AND the addiction of the taste and having something to do with your hands.

"7285","No judgement at all! I'd love for everything to be legalized I'm all for personal freedom. No stigma. I don't judge mind expanding or recreational use substances. Yet, why take any risks when if it's the problem you have other resources right? I mean if you said hey I wanna see what happens with dmt ....your call or if pot helps you chill go for it. But if you want a healthier life then:

I'm not for personal diagnosis...the road to figuring it out is tricky especially for adults. If your goal is a better healthier you...you are going to want to make sure it's adhd, take care of the comorbidities which are especially likely in adult women, find the right mix and it's more than meds it's lifestyle and therapy. Also, what if extended release is the best? 

I don't want you to feel judged at all! Just would feel bad to see this and what if it was thyroid or depression instead... I'd feel so guilty. You can be pro-expertise and anti-prohibition at the same time. I hope that doesn't sound argumentative! 

I'm so glad you are going to seek that out...the more I learned the more I understood my challenges. Whatever the result it sounds like you are resourceful and up to it! And, an evaluation will give you more insight: I learned I was combined (wasnt expecting the hyperactivity) and that my impulsivity was more prone to visual stimulation which has totally changed how I work. I'd start by googling adhd centers and don't be shy to call a pediatrician-not for an appointment but they tend to have better referrals. It's a process but you sound like a badass so go get that awesome life!

The euphoria didn't sound like an adhd reaction and I know women on 30mg....you might want to tell them this..... it's good information. Maybe just the psychologist though for obvious reasons. I'm not a doctor so I'm not sure. 

I absolutely don't think you are a druggie! But, where do those pills come from? (Rhetorical)My doctor doesn't even reccomend certain manufacturers...are you sure they arent coming from someone who needs them, etc. It's not you at all....just the culture and how it hurts the community in perception and in action. 

Whelp, that was a lot to say I didn't mean to sound personally judgmental....just the best serious advice I have. The only judgment I'd have is: if you really believe you have it why self-medicate? You sound way too knowledgeable. And there are plenty of reasons we all put off going to the doctor....but if you just wanted the pills because you didn't think you'd get the answer you wanted....yea that's judgment....because the real stigma is that is how so much of the world views this community. I'm trusting that isnt you! 

I definitely take you seriously and can see how compelling that road is. But going down that road hurts an already vulnerable population and you have concerns that deserve better than strangers on the internet!

How profound/qualitative/transformative is the change in consciousness ""supposed"" to be when you finally get treatment effects from medication? 

Or does it just depend on how severe your EFDD was? 

Because my brief 4-day response to 18mg Concerta was ***not*** subtle. It was profound. And I really really wonder why others report their treatment effects in such mundane terms like ""Yeah, it helped me focus better."" Whereas for me it was like the clouds parted or whatever superlative you want to use. 

Was I just getting high off the stimulants in some weird way? 

Or do I have an extreme version of the disorder such that treatment has a qualitative and profound effect on my consciousness but for others the experiential change would be more subtle? 

Or what's the deal? 

There are ***some*** ""profound"" reports that I found when digging through this subreddit of people breaking down and crying because the change in consciousness was so awesome/beautiful/profound once they got their medication right. But for the most part these ""profound"" reports seem rare and the more mundane reports seem more common.

"7347","I completely sympathise with your situation, I really wish I could give you some helpful advice however this has been something I've been struggling with myself recently. It's absolutely fantastic you're going to see your doctor, hopefully they will be able to explain many of the issues you've been dealing with and work with you in creating a plan that helps address them. 

I'm not a doctor, however from what you've said it seems as if you were right in your first view, that the issues that you're facing are consequences of AD(H)D (whether directly or indirectly). Whilst those without ADHD can obviously suffer from depression, lack of motivation and nicotine addiction, people with ADHD are significantly more susceptible to these things. This is due to the way ADHD affects the brain, in particular dopamine production. [u/maddawg579](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1l62o9/i_think_many_minor_mental_disorders_are_really/cbw6rr3) articulates this better than I ever could have myself.

&gt;""I have almost no ability to self-motivate. I never have. I have dreams, I have goals, I have things that I want to accomplish. But my ability to motivate myself to actually start accomplishing them is simply not there. This is where the dopamine deficiency comes into play. When someone without ADHD begins a task and starts seeing positive results, dopamine is released in the brain. This puts the person in a positive state and generally makes them feel good. It's nature's reward system.

&gt;The ADHD brain has a dopamine deficiency. So when they start a task and see results, they feel little to no sense of pride or satisfaction. The chemical that fuels those emotions is lacking. In other words, ADHD all but eliminates any internal incentive to accomplish a task. As such, motivation is externally dependent. Motivation for someone with ADHD comes from two primary sources: activities that release large amounts of dopamine in the brain, and one's desire to avoid crisis situations. Sexual activity, physical activity, video games, nicotine, alcohol, drugs, etc. are highly pleasurable because they release mass amounts of dopamine, thus they offer a strong incentive. Crisis situations cause stress, anxiety, depression, and just a general sense of severe emotional discomfort. Being aware of that, a person with ADHD will want to avoid that. If the incentive to avoid a crisis situation is stronger than the incentive to stay in their mental 'safe zone', then they can use that as motivation to complete a task. But completing a task based on self-motivation simply doesn't happen because the chemical incentive is not strong enough. 

&gt;This is why ADHD medications such as Adderall and Vyvanse are so important to us. They make up for the dopamine deficiency, which then fuels our ability to self-motivate. They offer the incentive that the ADHD brain doesn't produce on its own. It allows us to feel nature's reward system as intended, which we are not used to feeling through sheer force of will""

I'm not saying that receiving treatment for ADHD will miraculously solve any issues that you're going through, because honestly it won't. I've been medicated for 15 years and I still occasionally struggle with what you're describing.

It is, however, important to recognise that there very well may be an underlying medical reason for what you're experiencing, that what you're going through is in no way whatsoever a sign of weakness and that you're not alone in this. Good luck with it all mate, and we're here if you need someone to talk to.

If this is a woman that you've had issues with in the past, and if she really said what you say she did, then it's probably not an isolated event and you're probably not the only person that's struggled dealing with her.

"7371","Drugs while young have probably affected your brain. When I was younger, I was on Ritalin, and now I have an abnormal stimulant tolerance. 

I am 17 and anything below 15mg IR Dexedrine (10mg is very much an adult dose, and 15mg is the very most my doctor is allowed to prescribe for my weight and age) has no effect on me. There are other ways of medicating though. You could try SSRIs or SNRIs, often considered second or third-line meds. Tricyclics can also have powerful dopaminergic effects and function nothing like stimulants do, but are frequently only used as last-resorts. 

As for ""accepting this disorder"", it is true: ADHD is one of the least understood disorders. I myself think that we'll find out that ""ADHD"" is actually made up of many different disorders caused by different causes, but which all have similar effects. I suppose everyone who posts here has made the assumption, correctly or not, that they have ADHD. But regardless of how much we understand the facts remain that ADHD (or the disorders that might constitute ""ADHD"") is a real disorder with an extensive history of diagnosis and treatment. 

So if you do have it, you have it. Learn it, live it, beat it. Read the books, talk the talks, do the hard miles. It'll be hard at first, coping with it and whatnot, but eventually it'll just become another facet of your life. If you do it right, while you won't become ""normal"" (neither should you, in my opinion) but you'll be able to get done what needs to get done while minimising any disadvantages. 

Saying that an ADHD is ""underdeveloped"" is a little off. Many high achievers in society have, whether correctly or not, [been diagnosed with it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_notable_individuals_with_attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder). Interestingly, those with ADHD are often the oddballs or controversials of their field. ADHD is more of an unbalanced brain, much like clinical depression is.

Do you live with someone? If you are, consider having them dole out your dose. It takes the temptation out of your hands.

Another idea might be to invest in a pill case that holds pills for a month and fill it completely. It's more of a mental thing, but since you know visually how many pills there are in todays box the ""I have enough to take more"" night be less.

It always gets progressively worse, like the second I trip on one word because I couldn’t decide which to say between a few, I’ll start messing up more and more.

ADHD and PTSD both affect similar parts of the brain (frontal lobe/prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala/limbic system, which is quite interesting. ADHD makes people a lot more overreactive and sensitive to rejection, criticism, etc. I wonder if this increases the likelihood of developing symptoms of post traumatic stress from bullying, or being spoken down to by parents, teachers, and peers because they get frustrated and blame the symptoms on us as if they're character flaws rather than involuntary actions caused by having ADHD?

1: i had this big flash of excitement (“this will be so healthy for me! i’ll keep up with it every night”) and decided to start a gratitude journal. i wrote in it for 3 nights in a row, forgot about it for a week, forgave myself, wrote it in one more time, forgot about it for 3 weeks, forgave myself, wrote in it one more time...and now i haven’t touched it since october.

2: i had this huge burst of motivation to learn how to code. i got a fancy notebook, subbed to some coding subreddits, and found a step by step guide online. i went all-in, headfirst...for 5 days. haven’t touched that notebook in over 2 years.

3: i had a sudden rush of inspiration to start a personal, private blog documenting my struggles with chronic pain and mental health (“this will be so healing for me and for whoever eventually ends up reading it publically!). i wrote 3 long, hyper focused blogs...and haven’t touched it in a year.

A neurotypical brain can go “oh yeah, the paper is due in 2 weeks, maybe I could get that outline and write an intro and some of the important sections so I can stitch it all together next week.”

The ADHD brain goes “what even is time anyway? This isn’t due now, so it literally has no meaning.”

The doc went on about how she checks for prescription drug abuse records, if I lose the script I have to wait a month the get a new one, blood work each month, that she was more or less putting her name on the line.

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

"7533","They’re very similar on a molecular level, yes; however, methamphetamine has an extra “methyl group”, which, to put it simply, enables it to cross the blood-brain barrier at a faster rate. Essentially, this makes the effects of the drug much more potent.



So while Adderall and meth may be similar on a molecular level, they’re different on a chemical level, which is the key detail when talking about drugs and their effects.



For example, did you know that meth and caffeine share the same classification? They’re both considered stimulants. In spite of this, they’re obviously quite different, considering a huge percentage of our population drinks coffee on a daily basis.



Overall, I would say don’t worry about feeling like a junkie, you’re far from it. You’re using your PRESCRIBED drug responsibly and with good reason to do so :) hope you get over your feelings on the matter my friend

Also, ADHD and trauma/PTSD can definitely irritate each others symptoms. So, I would definitely suggest addressing the trauma from your sexual assault with a therapist too.

Lastly, ADHD sucks, but there is definitely a lot more you can do to work around it and choose jobs and daily routines that set yourself up for success once you are out of school too.

Second, I worked a lot this past semester with my therapist's guidance at **not feeling like a guilty piece of shit failure.** One tool that's helped me:

Every night I think about what I accomplished that day. I do it in a kind way to myself, as though I were a friend or nurturing parent.

**I congratulate myself for small victories.** Eating meals, getting out of bed on time, showering. 

**I congratulate myself for victories that aren't longterm goal related.** Like beating video game levels, helping someone out, making a good decision. 

**And of course, I congratulate myself for getting any part of my to-do list done.** I try to avoid beating myself up over the stuff I didn't do. It's okay. It's not the end of the world and I did the best I could that day.

**It might look a little like lowering the bar for yourself but it is a lot easier to get shit done when you feel confident and when you have a positive way to deal with those feelings of anxiety and being overwhelmed.**

One other thing, I know this has gotten long so you might not even read it all, but my therapist also explained that **anxiety** about the future often **stems from my brain's inability to distinguish time**.

And overtime I told him more about the more negative sides of things but he thankfully doesn’t see it as something negative and has said he loves me with or without adhd which means well.. a lot to me.

So just go for it and tell her how it affects you and that she please be patient when you struggle. It’s helpful already if she just knows what to expect so there wont be frustration later on.","ghewsyr",1,1609265677,"2020-12-29 18:14:37"

"7564","Thanks so much for your response. I definitely hear what you're saying and I agree with you.

At this point, the family is less worried about a label. We are all familiar with my niece's issues (as best as we can be), so a label is just a label - she's two and a half, so medication isn't really an option regardless.

Maybe I should rephrase. I'd be interested in providing her (and my brother-in-law) with some resources for parents working with children with developmental disabilities. ADHD, Autism, doesn't matter - however ADHD is the one that I can best directly relate to (and because of my history, the one that my family thinks is most fitting - biased of course).

They'll be going through all the steps of pre-intervention, finding the label, professional assessments &amp; recommendations, etc. I'd just like to see if there are any other parents out there (I know there are) that have dealt with similar situations and if they had anything that they found helpful so I can share with them.

I'll add that I did x-post this to /r/mental health, but I didn't get much love there. Thanks again for your response, even when there isn't a clear answer, it's nice to have someone from outside giving a new perspective on the situation.","d9hinlq",1,1478040029,"2016-11-01 22:40:29"

My most recent job was good at the beginning, I liked my coworkers, we drank a lot, I mean a lot, it wasn’t very strict or structured. But when I stopped drinking I realized that 90% of the people I “liked” were alcoholics with a bunch of other problems and we were only friendly cause we were constantly intoxicated. I started to disassociate most every shift I worked, to the point where my brain would go entirely blank, I would forget everything I had to do, I became very clumsy and even dropped an entire tray of food just because I was so out of it that I stepped on my foot the wrong way. I developed chronic fatigue and near constant physical pain to the point where I could only get out of bed to sit on my couch and after that I was too tired to do anything else. I started going to therapy and a lot of doctors and was diagnosed with PTSD, ADHD and fibromyalgia. I miss being good at that job and the feeling of being the zone. And the quick money of course.

I had really obvious symptoms of ADHD but even then nobody was thinking of ADHD. Its just not recognized that well in my country.

I do think meds temporarily solve a problem in terms of dopamine and that stuff. But I agree with you that they're only part of the puzzle.

I think for me, I don't take enough self care to eat well and sleep well, which is making my ADHD a lot worse. I can take meds to plaster over the tiredness from this, but it doesn't fix the growing underlying problem at these times, and I am making myself worse.

It's an important thing to remember. I know I wanted the meds to be a magic bullet but they are really a tool more than a fix.

That way you won't be there thinking about it, you can try and see how it feels, and then catch up on work also.  Honestly, and this is from my experiences, there are side effects of course, but they pale in comparison to some other psych meds to be honest.  At times I've tried different SSRI's for anxiety and nothing on earth could compare to how bad those side effects were.  They make adhd meds seem like nothing.  For some people adhd meds also help with their anxiety depending on what kind it is.  You seem similar to me in that you have a fear of things looming, and I think while the medication can maybe ramp up these thoughts in your head, the upside could mitigate it a lot.  How much is the dose?  If it's 20 or even 30 or below, you should be fine.  Also eat a big breakfast and take it early in the day, etc.","cfc74uo",1,1392083755,"2014-02-11 01:55:55"

The team consist of researchers from Washington university of medicine - and a neuroscientist who has spent more than 15 years doing research on ADHD.   


The aim is to create a platform that can make users aware - in the moment - what their reactions are, and create (or return to) a healthy response to the reaction associated with that emotion - in that particular situation.

I think it depends a lot on what your problems are and what you intend to study. 


It seems to me like money is the issue here to some degree right?
Assuming you live in the US, college it self will cost far more than any medication. So regardless of who is paying for your college it could easily be argued that meds would give you a higher chance of finishing on time, thereby reducing tuition costs and increasing your lifetime salary. 

If your parents are paying for college then perhaps they could be convinced that paying for your meds would make things cheaper overall? The same goes if you are paying yourself of course. ","dfk28so",1,1490793426,"2017-03-29 13:17:06"

There's a chemical imbalance in your brain that you have zero control over. You can't blame yourself for something like that. You didn't do anything for it to happen, it just happened.

My bf is a spanish major, so our work is completely different, otherwise trying to group study would get me nowhere.

"7665","The whole depression/adhd issue is difficult, because they can each either be the only reason for symptoms, but many people, especially adults with undiagnosed adhd, suffer from both. So please remember, that they are not mutually exclusive (anxiety can also be a part of it). 

ADHD is always chronic and you should be able to trace your symptoms back to your childhood. Many people, especially with inattentive ADHD/ADD, dont really show obvious symptoms so it might go unnoticed. You might also unknowingly figured out, how to deal with your issues and ADHD doesnt always require medication. A RECENT decrease in stuff like attention, motivation and concentration is usually caused by depression. 

If you managed to keep your shit together for all that time, it might be good to first talk about depression and so on, because diagnosing adhd during a severe depressive episode is extremely difficult. ADHD might still be the underlying problem, but dont tunnelvision on that too much. Dont try to form too many theories and focus on your actual symptoms. 

And obviously keep seeing your physician (switch physicians if you have personal issues with him/her). We cant diagnose anything for you and all this stuff, I wrote here is just personal experience.

Haven’t changed since (minus a few years where I refused to take meds but that’s a completely different story). It’s a complete lifesaver and I am completely dysfunctional without it. 
I found that Vyvanse and the dextroamphetamine mixes messed with my appetite the least, and I could at least FEEL hungry instead of just not eating for 2 days. 
Also, I don’t know if you’re aware but you can get prescribed Vyvanse (lisadexamfetamine) capsules and then there’s dextroamphetamine tablets, which uses the same amphetamine as Vyvanse but it’s a short term. I take Vyvanse 50mg but I also have a Rx for dextroamphetamine 10mg tablets, and sometimes I will take the dextroamphetamine instead of the Vyvanse if I need a med vacation or have a really lazy day, or even just in the middle of the day when the Vyvanse wears off (I have a sleep disorder, so my vyvanse/dextro acts as a double agent for adhd and excessive daytime sleepiness, so my vyvanse doesn’t last nearly as long as it does for most... 50mg lasts about 6 hours for me, so I often have to reup dexto10mg between 1-3pm). It does have a harsher come down, but another benefit of it is that it is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than Vyvanse (with my insurance I pay around $85 for my vyvanse, but $15 for the dextro) and for some people they get a more consistent coverage with the dextro where as sometimes Vyvanse has a tendency to have “dips” in efficiency through the day ","ehpffg8",1,1551630770,"2019-03-03 16:32:50"

"7687","Another Good Website is this one called RxList

[RxList on Intuniv](http://www.rxlist.com/intuniv-drug/side-effects-interactions.htm) that site has about 15 pages of info just on Intuniv.  I linked you the page of the side effects of Intuniv from a couple drug studies.  Note the most common side effect is somnolence (feeling tired, less energy) but it is dose responsive, higher dose, higher frequency of occurrence.

----

Now some personal stuff for me for I am on Intuniv.

* I had been on 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg.  I only had the tired side effect on the 3 mg, the higher the dose you go the more likely it occurs.

* Intuniv is also a blood pressure lowering med, I had no problems with too low of blood pressure except when I combined it with propranolol and since propranolol is also a blood pressure lowering medicine you saw too low of blood pressure.  That said there was multiple reasons why this was a very unusual thing.  I was taking propranolol as a daily preventive for my doctor said I could do it that way or as needed.  Well I was also taking all my pills at the same time, so you got that really low dip for 1 hour, but after that was fine.  If you stagger the meds there is no problem, I was originally taking Intuniv in the morning but now do so in the afternoon or evening (helps you sleep).  Furthermore Intuniv helps with the anxiety that I am now on the lowest dose of propranolol and only as needed (not taking it daily.)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Now as for your other questions.  How Intuniv works is it s a norepinephrine substitute, its an agonist.  The stimulants and strattera work by causing your neurotransmitters to last between the cells longer and thus having more time to activate.

Intuniv by contrast literally can turn on the receptors just like norepinephrine can.

Now norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter and a hormone, it literally causes a chain of events that determine your metabolism, how alert you are, how much blood sugar you have and how much insulin your body releases, your appetite, where you body puts water if you are low on water (you are dehydrated, or close to dehydrated), etc.


Now here is the amazing thing about norepinephrine. Humans have discovered at least 9 different types of norepinephrine receptors types.  And each receptor type has multiple purposes inside the brain and the body.

While other norepinephrine receptors ""speed you up"" they stimulate you, the alpha 2 receptors ""calm you down.""  Part of the purpose of the alpha 2 receptors is to tell when your body has too much norepinephrine, to act as a warning or relief switch saying slow down or stop pumping this stuff out for there is too much.

&amp;nbsp;

Well Intuniv only activates the alpha 2 receptors, it does not do the norepinephrine receptors that ""speed you up,"" because of this Intuniv is a norepinephrine stabilizer, if your norepinephrine is to high it actually lowers it.  But too much Intuniv and you may lower it too much, for your alpha 2 receptors are fooled thinking you have X units of norepinephrine when in reality that X is the combination of norepinephrine+intuniv.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Now here is the really cool part that makes intuniv special compared to other alpha 2 drugs such as kapvay aka clondidine.

One of the things your brain does is that it uses alpha 2a in certain parts of your brain to enhance the quality of the electrical signal for nerve cells.  It increases the power (while dopamine fine tunes the signal/frequency, they work together as a team.).  It appears only Alpha 2a does this in the brain regions we want to treat with ADHD such as the frontal lobe and specifically the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, one of the brain regions tied to working memory, concentration, planning, and problem solving.  Thus it is easier to use these brain regions if you are on the right dose.  Also Intuniv turns on the cerebellum, and it also helps the anterior cingulate, and the motor area of the brain to a lesser extent, all brain regions connected to ADHD, but also tied to things like the application of movement within your spatial area (it is easier to be precise in other words).

Now Clonidine is an unselective Alpha 2 drug, so you get more of the tiredness and less of the benefit, this is because Intuniv is 15 to 20 times more selective for alpha 2a over alpha 2b and alpha 2c.

&amp;nbsp;

----

&amp;nbsp;

**I am almost done**

One of the things that is known about Intuniv and to a far greater extent with Strattera is that often the tiredness can go away in 2 to 4 weeks.  What happens is your body recalibrates some of the norepinephrine receptors so that you get the positive benefits of calming down and better focus but far less energy drained.  Your body only does this when your norepinephrine levels are higher 24 hours per day, it is designed to not recalibrate them if the fluctuation situationally like your norepinephrine is higher here for an hour due to a medicine or due to situational stress and that your body purposefully releases adrenaline and norepinephrine. 

Now Both Intuniv and Strattera can cause this side effect, and the first few weeks can suck for it takes 2+ weeks to build up effective levels of the drug in your blood so the effect is 24 hours a day, that is why you should start the dose slowly and go up.

**I am guessing** that your doctor started with 2mg since you are on adderall and adderall cancels some of the side effects of intuniv, and intuniv cancels some of the side effects of adderall and thus he or she thought you could take 2 mg.

Oh if you look at the side effects for intuniv, roughly 1 in 5 or 1 in 6 gets headaches.  This is because intuniv changes your blood pressure and changes in your blood pressure can cause headaches.","cpsk1fd",1,1427468523,"2015-03-27 15:02:03"

Now that you know ADHD is a thing (I'm still kinda unclear whether you were diagnosed or not), maybe this can help out things in perspective. But I would say that medication is certainly something that should be discussed with you and a doctor. 

As for 'convincing' your parents; I think the best approach is be honest. Tell them how you feel, how you think medication could help, and that it will be overseen by a physician. Ask if they trust the doctors, because if they do, then they should trust you, too. It's a dialogue. Doctors don't just throw pills at you. It's a process.

Laundry is hard bc I have to start several times and waste half a day I can not use for anything else.    
Both sucks!

I tried gloves, but apparently I need some that go beyond my elbow and stay there, because mine just stopped a little below elbow and that meant that some water got into them, which wasn’t that much of a problem until I wanted to use them the next time and they smelled like a dead rats guts. I think the smell is the worst anyways, so gloves can only do so much, but I’ve got peppermint oil now that I can apply under my nose, that helps a little. Luckily I love the strong peppermint smell, I know it would be a nightmare for others 😅

I don’t know if I like dishes or laundry more.. dishes are hard, exhausting, disgusting and long. But I can usually do them in one go! Getting up for laundry once is okay. But then a second time. And then a third! And then still having to fold it all and put it away! I have to get this starting energy many many times during the process, and it is just not possible to reschedule taking stuff out of the washer into the dryer, so I have to be able to do it at that specific time. Plus it takes like 3 hours total (at least, with getting all together and then folding, it might be more), and I can not use the time inbetween for anything else, because I am in this weird waiting mode..

Now that I'm 30, I think I've come to terms with my Mom's abuse. We don't talk about it - we have many communication issues.

I'm not okay with it in the sense that I consider it wrong and I'm not happy it ever happened. (Though I understand everyone has their share of pain and this was mine.) I have not forgiven her, since she never apologized. It's a logical consequence that because of what she did, there's only so much close we can be.

Back to you. Obviously, if it keeps surfacing, then it's bubbling inside and must be dealt with. The ideal case is to tell anyone who wronged you how you feel, but I understand how they may resist acknowledging it. I'm not a therapist and don't have great advice here.

It is not whether you are perfect or they are perfect, it is whether you are perfect together. (Quote from memory from someone famous. Details...)

You are lovable. You may have qualities that impact yourself or people around you in ways you don’t like. You may decide to work on those qualities. Regardless of your decision, you are worthy of love. Right now, you’re probably looking at yourself more negatively b/c you feel badly. It is understandable, but not a reflection of reality. It’s your perception of reality, through the filter of pain. It does not make it any less painful right now, but neither does it make you any less worthy of love. 

Lovability is something I struggle(d) with for a long time. If you want, feel free to PM me. Every human is lovable. You are lovable. I’m sorry you went through something painful, and I hope you find friends to help you through it, and a wonderful counselor if you continue to question whether you deserve love.

"7756","I guess this thread's a bit old now but I'm totally there with you.

23, just got diagnosed. It's grad school where it really started to be a problem.

I noticed a lot of the things in the evaluation that they ask about you as a kid did apply to me, but I was in a private school environment where certain behaviors that can signify ADHD were actually encouraged (talking in class, multitasking, hands-on learning preferences).

As a kid I was always in the 'gifted' programs, I never had issues, was straight A until high school, where I still managed a 3.7 with barely any studying.  

College was fine too. First 2 years were easy, I could get away with not doing much studying, writing my papers last minute, and still average about a 3.5. The last 2 years started kicking my butt a bit, but I just blamed it on senioritis and depression. I managed to graduate on time, with only 2 Cs, I think my final GPA was about 3.4.

Grad school though... man, 2 incompletes in one year already. Even less structure than undergrad. Can't BS a paper last minute. I finally decided to get evaluated, and yup, definitely ADHD. They also tested IQ at the same time, and gave me a range of 134-142, and said that can definitely mask ADHD for a long time.

I also have some depression and anxiety now because I've always known I can do better, but for some reason could never get myself to. The ""you just don't apply yourself"" comments have followed me for a while now. I'm hoping the diagnosis and medication can help. ","d4svdtm",1,1467223731,"2016-06-29 18:08:51"

"7774","I always get kind of upset when I hear about people buying the meds illegally, especially when it's something that I and a lot of other people I know had to really fight tooth and nail for. Depending on where you live, it can be *extremely* difficult to get prescriptions for these meds. I had one friend in high school who had an rx but their brother would always steal their pills and either sell them to friends or take them himself. I believe they had adderall and I'm not sure if it's still like this, but if you're going through too many of those pills and requesting refills too much, you can get accused of distributing or abusing and have your rx denied, which was really shitty for said friend with the asshole brother.

**But.**

Nowadays I try to think about it this way:

It took me *years* to get a diagnosis and prescription with a lot of doctors kicking and screaming that I didn't need it (if you're a girl with ADHD-PI, you know the struggle, I'm sure. I went years not even knowing 90% of my problems were from this.) 

So who is to say that the people who buy it for school aren't in the same boat? Being told they don't need it, being denied prescriptions left and right, etc. The gaslighting is so real in the ADHD world, especially for PI types, I think (because PI symptoms are so easy to be misdiagnosed as other things.)

Besides, it's not worth getting riled up over.

I used to get mad, but now I just feel sorry for them having to go through such methods just to get by in school.

It's one thing if you're doing it to go party all night or something, but if you're doing it to get by in school, who am I to decide you don't need it, y'know? Otherwise I'm just as bad as every doctor who tried telling me my symptoms were all in my head and that I just needed to apply myself better.

Anyway, you never know what other people are going through, but if they're blowing hundreds just for one-time uses (esp in college, when everyone is dirt-poor af) they're probably desperate and I'll sleep easier imagining they probably needed it just as bad as I did before I got lucky enough to get a diagnosis/rx.","ej3t56u",1,1553246080,"2019-03-22 09:14:40"

* Things to fidget with are great to keep that excess energy/attention occupied (e.g. fidget spinners, rubiks cube, pen &amp; paper for doodling, etc.)

* Completing chores together or with upbeat music playing in the background helps A LOT (you wash dishes &amp; he dries, folding laundry together, or even just being there to chat with him while they get done)

* Saying his name and waiting for him to answer you properly before speaking to him about something (if he makes a sound but doesn't look at you, don't assume he's actually paying attention - we learn how to seem like we're paying attention when we're not over the years)

* If you notice him zoning out or getting distracted while talking to him, touch him or gently say his name to bring him back 

* If he's open to it (and I hope he is!!), watch ""ADD &amp; Loving It!"" with him. It's fast paced and ridiculous enough for most of us to stay focused on it, and is a great example of ADHDers who are more hyperactive/impulsive.

* One potential way to convince him to see someone is to offer to help him get it all sorted by finding someone to see, making appointments for him, making sure he goes/going with him, getting together any documents needed to provide evidence of symptoms since childhood. Sometimes we will say no to things because the whole organising part of it is insanely overwhelming and stressful, and it's difficult for us to break things down in smaller, more manageable tasks.

As for the degree, I'm applying to a local college to finish up some prerequisites and then it's smooth sailing haha.

I'm going to try the first few weeks of school/concentration without any meds, then if it's really as bad as I remember I'll inquire with my doctor.

Just now did the first algebra I had done in 2 years, as my friend explained to me. Felt like I had to recruit every neutron to string together a simple concept. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.

I would reccomend learning the basics of asian cooking, it's a lot less recipe heavy than western cooking and imo way more versatile. Also, as long as you have some kind of broth you can throw some veggies and meat in and make a passable soup to snack on.

"7813","Hey there!! 

That is so awesome than you want to go into the medical field. I'm in medical school myself, though I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until after nearly failing my first year of med school classes (things are much better now, thank goodness!!). The diagnosis made so much sense, though unfortunately it took years of anxiety, failing some tests, depression, etc before it finally came to fruition. I tell you this just to let you know that this advice is coming from a place of experience.

First of all, it is so inspiring to hear how you have overcome so many hurdles. Clearly, you are not someone who gives up easily. That's an awesome quality to have, and it will take you far.

I think you should seek out as much academic advising at your school as you can. Find an advisor or mentor who seems to ""get"" your struggles, and who will give you honest and meaningful advice on how to move forward. If your school as a pre-med advisor, I would suggest you meet with that person as soon as you can...they will have a good perspective. Come to all your meetings prepared (bring a resume or a list of extracurriculars/volunteer/work experience if you have any, and have questions in mind that you would like to ask). 

Applying to med school is rough, and it is not the most predictable process. It sounds like you are pretty set on being a surgeon, which is awesome. It may also be useful to spend some time thinking about what you would do if becoming a physician didn't happen (this is also a common med school interview question, so it's good to think about regardless!!). To become a physician, you can go to an MD school or a DO school. DO schools, while they still produce amazing doctors, usually don't require as high of MCAT scores or GPAs. PA (physician assistant) school is also an option (and one I was considering). You could go to PA school, then still work in surgery (I know that it's not the same as being a surgeon, but PAs that work with surgeons actually get to spend a lot of time with patients, which is a plus!). I could go on about all of the awesome jobs you could get in medicine (Nursing, nurse practitioner, respiratory therapist, occupational therapy, etc). 

I am in NO WAY saying you should lower your expectations of yourself because of your history with ADHD and depression. Rather, what I am saying is that these other professions would be worthwhile to look at for anyone with a passion in medicine. My point is that the world is full of amazing opportunities. Work your hardest and find something you truly love. 

Now, I realize that I haven't given you much practical advice yet. I think finding what works to deal with ADHD and depression vary on a person to person basis, but I will let you know what worked for me. In college, I hopped around to a couple different therapists before finding one that I really clicked with. She was awesome. She suggested I join a group therapy program at my school for students suffering from depression. It was great to be able to learn from my peers and talk so openly about things that are so often kept quiet. These sessions focused on Mindfulness. If you haven't heard of Mindfulness before, I would highly suggest you google it! It is basically set on the principle of practicing self-regulating yourself by listening to your internal cues, clearing your mind through meditative techniques, and focusing on the positives. 

As far as school is concerned, I did best when I tried to hold myself accountable. I would schedule office hours with my professors in advance, and that would give me the motivation to complete a certain amount of work and have questions to ask them by the time our meeting rolled around. I get distracted easily, so I got noise canceling headphones, which are also AMAZING (I sometimes put earplugs in, then put the headphones on if I want complete silence). Most importantly, though, I tried to forgive myself for not accomplishing as much as I would have hoped to, and at the end of every day, I would list the things I accomplished, no matter how small. I am sure you understand that when you are depressed, even getting out of bed and going to class is an accomplishment to be proud of. Letting negative thoughts fade away and focusing on the positives was the best way to alleviate my anxiety. There were many times that I slipped back into an anxious mess, but having a toolbox of skills I learned from my group therapy and mindfulness sessions helped bring be back into a positive mindset.

You seem to be very invested in self-improvement (or else you would not have posted on here asking for help!). STAY THAT WAY!!! You're seriously the bomb...not everyone has the determination that you are showing right now. Just remember that you rock, no matter what, and that you are going to do something awesome with your life.

For some subjects, I just plain liked learning about them, so it was easy for me to hyperfocus on things that interested me and so everyone thought I was a hard working student. In reality there were like 1 or 2 subjects that grabbed my attention fully and I didn't bother studying for the rest. 

2300 on my SAT, graduated 2nd in my class, got in to a great school - all started falling apart in college when things stopped being easy for me. Turns out the major I picked stopped being interesting after a while, and I couldn't get hyperfocused on them anymore. And I couldn't keep up without actually doing work, work that I couldn't possibly ever start on and I just kept falling further and further behind.

You should absolutely take this up with your doctor but it just leads back to my original post. ADHD meds aren’t miracle cures and it takes a lot of practice, training and patients to really utilize it. The things you spoke about are relatively common and even after 24 years my mind still races until I do my routine. 

You should ask about mindfulness training when you speak with your doctor and also when you wake up do some form of exercising like running walking etc (granted it is difficult with the current situation). I’ve taken to do fit boxing on the Nintendo switch to avoid going outside. This helps slow your mind and will also make you happy.

I'd recommend you to read up on the wiki about getting diagnosed, there is a test there that will ask you what kind of things you have trouble with. If you have more than 6 symptoms you have grounds to go to the doctor. 

You can try medication, it helps immensely with conversations in my experience.

If you are really against that you should try to get good sleep hygiene, do lot's of excercising, eating healthy food and meditation.

"7854","It sounds like he has real self-esteem issues. A lot of people with ADHD have a lot of negative self-talk and think of themselves as lazy and blame themselves for their symptoms. He may have had a very difficult time with the way he was treated by his school or family when he was being treated as a kid. It sounds like he views it as a defect he doesn't want to be associated with. You may want to back off the topic for a while. Truthfully, many people don't want to be diagnosed by a partner. It can be painful and embarrassing. Instead, focus on ways to encourage his self-esteem and wellbeing that might get him to take an interest in it, too.

Maybe see if there's any tips that you can integrate into your environment that are helpful to people with ADHD--many times the same things can be helpful to other people as well. Here's some examples: 

See if there's any tasks that you might be able to swap with him. If paying bills and grocery shopping are too much for him (tasks that are pretty frequently stressful for people with ADHD), see if there's something else non-financially related and not in a crowded public place with a ton of sensory stimuli that he can take on instead while you handle those tasks.

Encourage him to exercise with you and to drink water.

Find novel things to do with him that will help his brain produce dopamine, but get him involved in that, too. Like, scheduling a regular date night where you try something you've never done before and you take turns planning it.

Make household schedules and to-do lists with deadlines. Remember that it will take him more time and energy when doing things than you might think, so plan appropriate down-time, too.

Play some of his favorite music while doing chores. Something energetic.

See if you can turn a chore into a competition.

Celebrate his interests and make sure he feels like there is time and space to explore them, such as giving yourselves a regular night off from each other to do your own things.

And then instead of bringing up what you've learned about ADHD, try asking him about his experiences. Ask him what it's like in his brain. When he thinks, does he hear a voice or see pictures or something else? If he hears a voice, is it his voice? How many thoughts does he normally have going through his head at one time and what can the range of topics cover? Does the background noise sound like anything in particular? Does he ever have moments when there's not thoughts in his head (probably not if he's ADHD)? What are his thoughts like when he's angry with himself? Try to get him to be as specific as possible in talking about what the experience in his head is like. Then share what your experience is like so he can see what's the same or different. You may not be able to cover all the topics all at once, depending on how open he is, but it may be enlightening for you both.","gnuo9vb",1,1613622935,"2021-02-18 04:35:35"
"7855","I think the sensory experience of rapid change of a physical state is what gets me most. Losing focus is definitely part of it, it really feels like switching tracks without any choice or warning. Not in pain -&gt; suddenly in pain; quietly writing or reading -&gt; someone walks into the room and sits to talk with you; sitting in the light -&gt; suddenly sitting in the dark; ears full of sound -&gt; suddenly back to irl noise, etc. When my brothers would jump out of closets at me or turn off the light suddenly or yank my hat off as a kid, or now when my earbuds get pulled at/out, it enraged me for a second and I couldn't figure out why for the longest time, logically it's not a big deal and once I had a few seconds to process what happened I was fine. 

But the unexpected physical feeling of being with a hat and then suddenly without was very much a sensory overload. Same with sudden fear during a prank when a second ago everything was normal, or having sound fill my ears and then suddenly I'm plunged back into a different type of noise (along with the unpleasantness of the actual yank, but I even feel it in the car when I'm vibing a song and I accidentally bump the radio off). 

A few years ago my boyfriend pulled my hat off as a joke, and I felt the EXACT same feeling of intense discomfort and rage for a second before it was gone, and was astounded, I didn't know it was from actually having the hat pulled.

Not sure I want to tell my employer about my diagnosis because this company is very old fashioned and I have a lot of older coworkers who see ADHD as a lack of discipline, and an issue of laziness rather than a disorder that needs help to be managed. But as long as I keep making steady progress and look like I'm moving towards where they want me to be at, I think I can last long enough to find a new job :)

"7878","Whether I count as having ""other mental disorders"" or not I don't know, since I've been told since starting treatment for ADHD that I never had depression. Certainly I was never actually diagnosed with depression, but had suffered with what I always assumed was depression (basically, repeated failure and self loathing cycle plus lethargy) from about when I was 14 until I was diagnosed at 27.

I had kept noticing a pattern. I knew I was a disorganised, forgetful person who found it damn near impossible to gain any motivation for anything even when it was something I liked, I had identified these things by the age of 17 but I had no idea that it was a disorder or that it was something outside of my control. So I coasted a lot trying to find the magic bullet/subject which would be my motivation.

I got pregnant when I was 19 (apparently this is extremely common for ADHD women, but I didn't know I had ADHD at the time, let alone know this fact, so hey) so from 20-25 the whole new parent/young parent/single parent/broke parent thing led me to assume the lack of motivation, organisation and constant tiredness was down to all of this so didn't really look further for a cause. I did go to my GP with feeling tired and blah all the time but he prescribed me iron and vitamin D and when those didn't help, I was too scattered to call back and say so for about another two years.

So by the time I was 25 or so. I had worked out that the normal methods of organisation just don't work for me. I can't use lists because I lose the list or forget to write things on it or forget to tick them off so I lose track of what I've done or I just forget to look at it entirely so everything doesn't get done. Just one example, repeat for every organisational method (I have tried them all.) I had started to find a few things which were unconventional but worked for me as workarounds but I didn't have any idea why I needed such elaborate workarounds. It was also starting to come up as an argument with my husband because he'd be like ""Why don't you always shower or brush your teeth?"" and I was like ""I literally forget"" and he was all ""That is not normal"". I used to frequent parenting forums a lot and one thread which comes up fairly often is organisational tips or ""why are late people always late?"" and I always found those threads a great fascinating read. Eventually one day I was reading a thread about somebody's lazy, messy, forgetful husband and the wife was so frustrated because she couldn't see how he could forget such basic things and somebody posted a link to the ADHD-PI wikipedia page, and holy shit it was like somebody had condensed everything I'd learned about myself over the last decade and put it right there into a handy little list.

So then it took me another couple of years in total to get my shit together enough to actually ask a medical professional about this (in the meantime devouring everything I could find on the matter online) and then after that to follow up all the various appointments and I was finally diagnosed at the age of 27 amid a gigantic fear that I was just imagining this and they'd say I was a fraud or just lazy, and the doctor said I was an absolutely textbook case. So there is that. There wasn't any one particular event or responsibility which kicked off the need, though I guess you could say marriage, since I was worried my husband wouldn't want to actually stay with me once he realised how terrible I am to live with, and his condition was basically if you're having issues coping with normal life then you should look at getting some help, and he'd always support me as long as he can see me trying those kind of avenues. Which I felt was fair. (The timelines of these conversations is screwy, but that is how my memory works.)","d4enzfn",3,1466283736,"2016-06-18 21:02:16"

I generally do not like giving any reason for a person to second guess me. There are always a variety of reasons why people lose confidence in people and I dont want to add prejudice and ignorance about mental illness to it. But describing it this way, when needed, kind of clicks for most people. They have usually heard of some memory or brain injury that causes memory or time issues and if you can be successful on top of that, they will see you in good standing. But remember ADHD is a disorder we need to work around. Whatever level we exist at now there is almost always room to improve in some way and should never put ourselves in a box of disorder that keeps us from seeing opportunities for growth. Absolutely not saying that we should treat ourselves harshly and pretend that we can will away or habit away our adhd, to the contrary. We should recognize our weaknesses and always be engaging with it to improve ourselves.

I’m not saying that these people are *qualitatively different* from you and I, we all have these tendencies, and they’re often amplified by stress or if we’re under pressure, but some have them to a greater degree.

"7902","Well, I try to lift weights 3x a week, and I also do spin classes 2-3x a week. I also bike commute full time. When I'm consistent with working out, I'm way less likely to eat poorly because in my personal experience, working out, healthy eating, sleeping enough, and drinking enough water all intertwine with each other.  Because I work out a lot, I can eat more so I don't beat myself up too much if I overeat...but the reality is that I am still indulging. 

A good tip with exercise is to do something that you enjoy.  I hate running but I looooove spin classes.  I also like volleyball.  I think that you should try to work out for three months straight.  It's ok if things interrupt it once in awhile, but try to get right back on top of it.  

In regards to overeating, try to set your food schedule up rigidly.  Three meals a day, prepare your snacks ahead of time and keep them in plastic baggies so that you don't overeat.  Drink a 12oz glass of water before you start eating anything.  Don't buy junk food...it's hard to binge on carrots haha.  I used to pour soap on my plate of food when I knew that I was done but was scared I was going to keep eating until I was stuffed to the point of discomfort.

I do think you should talk to your doctor about the overeating issue. Stress, anxiety, depression are all other things that can contribute to overeating.  ","cuu2skd",2,1441682625,"2015-09-08 03:23:45"
"7903","Links to and mentions of ADDitude are not allowed on /r/adhd because we feel they have demonstrated themselves to be untrustworthy and that they, despite soliciting donations from people with ADHD to fund their operation, prioritize profit and advertising dollars over our best interests.

They also have had articles for Vayarin (a medical food that is now no longer sold in the US because its research was bunk) that suspiciously looked like stealth advertisements (which is highly unethical and illegal in the US).

We also find it problematic that their medical review panel includes not only legitimate doctors and psychologists, but also (at the time of writing) one practitioner of integrative medicine, which combines legit medical practice with pseudoscience and alternative medicine.

"7933","My first job was as a dishwasher at a restaurant I had wanted to work at for a while. I was scheduled for a week of training shifts. After the first one the dishwasher I was hired to augment walked away. Then we had a ridiculous night, and as the only one with any training in that I was called in on a day off at the last minute. Almost no idea what I was doing, barely stumbling through, and then I get the news that a party of 30 just showed up without a reservation. The thing most people don't think of is that it's a lot more than the dishes from the dining room. We get all the food prep dishes too. And the barware. Oh and the silverware has to be run twice in a row. And I was responsible for cleaning the whole kitchen at the end of the night. And taking out the trash. And the grease from frying. All for minimum wage. Which was about $6 at the time. And with almost no training, they were always comparing me to the guy that I was forced to replace who had been there three years. After a month, they couldn't take my 'late' nights (getting done closing around midnight was common because of the lack of training and heavy workload for someone that had no job experience before, but it wasn't terrible, all things considered)and they fired me. Saved up enough in that time to get a couple of nice suites I still have to this day (one needs some fixing because a seam has worn out, but they're great suits).

"7948","I'm not sure if this is ADHD or just people in general.  I work in a field where I spend a lot of time with people, helping hem develop their careers and this a common thing. Something that has helped me is to embrace, the fact that it makes you uncomfortable and to be honest about it.  ADHD or not we work better under a certain amount of pressure and we learn faster when we're uncomfortable. No one out there is perfect and does everything the right/same way every single time. The way people react to that pressure (also the failure when making mistakes) is one of he most telling things leaders look at when judging a persons character and considering them for advancement. 

If you consciously choose to put yourself in the same uncomfortable place enough times it will become a comfortable place.  Putting yourself in a place that makes you vulnerable is one of the hardest things to do, but if you commit to it, I promise you, nothing bad will happen assuming you're actually achieving the right results.

I haven't taken it myself so I can't give any advice. What I can say is that Adderall/Ritalin can be very scary for many because it has the potential to be abused, so perhaps a non stimulant might be a way to ease your parents into it?

I would also say if you can, for you and your parents together to watch some videos on ADHD like HowToADHD. I think it's important for both parties to try an learn together! And I also think it may help them understand that medication doesn't have to be scary either. Good luck!","e2tfsqu",2,1532234797,"2018-07-22 04:46:37"

"7953","Steer into the skid?... Medication, routine, diet, exercise and experience.

It's difficult to explain but my work is also a good environment for ADHD in my opinion.  Our company is a highly results orientated and title-less company, one of its biggest strengths as well is the focus on responding to changing requirements and priority.  

of those projects I described all likely ""should"" be done but only a few need to be done right fucking now.  The entire company is also geared towards properly assessing the urgency of each project and accepting that less important projects will be scheduled when possible. 

So hypothetically you have 7 regular just need to be done projects on the go and you get told about a screaming urgent project, if you forget about those 7 projects for 3 days while you deal with the urgent issue its not necessarily bad assuming you've also cannibalized the project teams from most of them to address the urgent issue.  Different project managers at the company also tend to have a different focus, I happen to be the guy that typically gets to chase large fires/fuck-ups around regardless of who caused them.","d7uz4d1",1,1474398427,"2016-09-20 19:07:07"

So, my experience is in foreign language, and honestly, I don't really know yet if it's the content or the method, but I am leaning more towards the method being the better part of achievement with students with ADHD. Unfortunately, most instructional/curriculum design doesn't seem to take into account how students with ADHD learn - and this varies a lot because of multiple intelligences. I have a couple of kids (the nutcases, I love/hate them - mostly love) that just love to talk while another student who's primarily inattentive wants the full explanation, every single detail included, and takes notes very dutifully. There's definitely a different process at work there, and finding the type of curriculum that would benefit both has been a real tough balancing act.","fyqqkgh",1,1595313630,"2020-07-21 06:40:30"
"7971","Our stories almost line up so I know what you are going through. I changed jobs/careers sort-of last year. I went from one form of what I do to another. I had realized that the segment I was in, just wasn't for me. So I did the switch. I took a tole on my personal life so hopefully you can do it with more finesse than I did. 
I recommend to everyone on here to read books and learn as much as you can about ADHD. This gives you the tools to change the things that are holding you back. It isn't easy but it is possible. I would just say learn everything you can. I did and I'm in a better place to recognize my limits and try and fix them. I have changed so many things in my life over the past year, I didn't think it was possible, but I was able to. Knowing all I can about ADHD helps me overcome a lot of its effects. 

As far as the sleep thing. Keep adjusting your Rx and keep working with your Dr to get it right. I take Adderall everyday and it works for me. If I feel like I don't need it 1 day I can do that too. I'm almost to the point where I can choose when not to take it so I can focus on something intently and get it done. Not an exact science but sometimes I like to loose myself in a drawing or painting so I don't take a pill. Things like that. But if you aren't sleeping, adjust the Rx. It shouldn't keep you awake. 

It sounds like for you a career change would take some schooling and lifestyle changes. Make sure the rest of your family is on board and wiling to roll with it while you try to find some happiness. Everyone's life will be better after a few years of hard work. So hopefully they can support you.

This is such an ironic tragedy of the disorder.

Once you start having to fend for yourself and actually doing adult things, it suddenly feels like you can't do anything without someone holding your hand.

"7997","I havent had any issues with battery life. I took it out of the charger at 9am this morning, and it has 87% now. Generally I think it will last me about two days, if I dont charge it.

The great thing though, is that it charges really quick. I have a charging dock at my desk and on my bedside table. I use the watch to track my sleep, so I can't charge it at night. Instead I give it a short charge before bedtime, while getting ready to sleep, and then I give it a short charge again in the morning. Even if its below 10%, I can charge it for 20 minutes or so, and have enough of a charge to last me through the day.

So for me, battery life has not been an issue. Even after more than a year of daily usage.

About the NFC stuff. Check out [Automate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.llamalab.automate). Its pretty much a flow-chart programming thing, where its really easy to set up some simple automation. Like ""when I scan this NFC chip, do this thing.""
You can also check out [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm), but its quite a bit more complicated, and at least for me it has been too cumbersome to work with. That being said - its a lot more powerful than Automate.

My current psychiatrist finally diagnosed me after so many drs said bipolar, depression and trying medications that did nothing.

"7999","Based on what you said, and echoingbsome other responses:

Let people know ahead of time that this is an issue. Tell them to call, please, and not take it personally. Emphasize that it is a real struggle for you. People that can't cope are not going to be ideal friends/lovers.

Limit your responses in time and length. Set up a timer and word limit, and only allow a few seconds for edits. If you're writing huge responses, you have a monologue, not a dialogue, and it's a huge deal of work if you are writing an essay out for every reply. Of course it stresses you out! If you can't say it in a sentence or two, you're doing too much.

Schedule days and times to respond to certain people. Set up a call schedule with them if you can, so you can write down when you need reach out. Externalizing the deadline can help you keep consistent and accountable, and you can set alarms. 

Don't be afraid to reach out after a long silence. I have friends I talk to once or twice a year, and when we talk, it's always fun, and we still meet up when I'm in the area. Not every friend is going to be an everyday friend, and that's okay! 

You may lose people because of this issue, but as much as it may hurt at the time, it is better to be honest about what you can do, and to not feel guilty if you can't meet their needs. Not everyone is compatible as lovers or friends, and a small circle of good matches is better than a wide net of strained relationships.","exbx18g",1,1566139470,"2019-08-18 14:44:30"

I'm afraid they might insist on sorting out the depression first before addressing the adhd. The symptoms can overlap, so they need to get the depression treated well to sort out which symptoms go with which syndrome.

"8075","**#1** If you have not watched Dr. Barkley video to help parents of ADHD kids you need to watch it.

* [30 Essential Ideas Every Parent Needs to Know about ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCAGc-rkIfo) this is the video on youtube as 1 long youtube video

* [Same Video but in smaller chapters in a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhbAK1pdPM&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY)

In this video he talks about this, the 30% rule of ADHD kids (they act younger than there actual age), plus many good things you need to know to understand your son, as well as many tips on how to make his ADHD less severe with non med environmental changes and medication.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**#2** It is well known with ADHD that some symptoms of ADHD get better as a person gets older.  

* [This graph which is a timeline of ADHD Symptoms does a good job describing it](http://i.imgur.com/VnW1veN.png)

Effectively the brain is better at ""internalizing"" hyperactivity and impulsive symptoms as the brain matures.  Your son may feel the need to be busy and active, but now he is keeping those thoughts in his head instead of climbing onto furniture.

Now other symptoms of ADHD do not really improve when you get older.  For example working memory, your son will always be forgetful unless he is on medication.  That said the hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms often decrease.  Sometimes they decrease to such as point where after the kid is around age 10 to 12 they are no longer even apparent and you can be tested for ADHD and you will only have ADHD inatttentive symptoms (ADHD-PI) and you would no longer test as ADHD Hyperactive (ADHD PH) or having both categories of symptoms which is called ADHD Combined.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**#3** Lastly one of the recent developments of the last 5 years, is we have studies that did neuroimaging on the same kids for several years and we saw how their brain developments.  There are over 30+ studies that compared ADHD Kids that went on stimulant medication, ADHD kids that never went on medication, and finally non ADHD kids.

Well these studies have now created a pattern.  The use of stimulant medication does not hurt the brain, in fact the opposite pattern emerged.  The ADHD kids who went on medication and were kept on their medication had a slightly more normal looking ADHD brain than compared to the ADHD kids who never went on medication.

Now these kids were not cured of ADHD and only certain parts of the brain became ""more normal""  (it was mainly the right caudate of the basal ganglia).  That said it helped the kids see a reduction of ADHD symptoms.

Now the brain areas improved if you know your science on the brain were areas related to impulse control and hyperactivity.  They were not areas related to inattention.

----

The scientists have a hypothesis on why this is happening. We know with ADHD two things are happening.

* 1) With ADHD kids certain brain regions develop at a slower pace than non ADHD kids.  Sometimes these brain regions normalize in size as adults but sometimes these regions will be 3 to 8% smaller as adults.  These brain regions are incorporated into brain networks that do things such as self regulation, impulse control, self monitoring, working memory, planning, problem solving, time management, motivation, emotional control, etc.

* 2) The second thing is certain brain regions are under active electrically.  The brain is preferring to use certain brain regions while other brain regions are ""dark"" and thus these networks are under utilized.  The reason why this is happening is due to genetics and neurotransmitters.  The brain makes the right amount of neurotransmitters but it can not use specific neurotransmitters (such as dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine) effectively.  For example it either does not release enough neurotransmitters due to a stimuli, or it puts the neurotransmitters back into storage prior to the neurotransmitters doing their job.  Well neurotransmitters are how the brain knows to turn on certain brain regions and to not turn on other brain regions.  ADHD medications correct this imbalance of brain regions for they help the brain use its neurotransmitters correctly.  Now the ADHD medications work in different ways some allow neurotransmitters to stay out of storage longer giving them more time to do their job, some make the brain release more neurotransmitters for the same stimuli, and a third kind makes the brain need less neurotransmitters to trigger the same effects.

* 3) Well number 1 and 2 are known for sure.  The hypothesis number 3 is that we know that to form neural networks, to create the webbing that connects brain regions those regions have to be in use.  So by correcting electrical imbalances caused by neurotransmitters the brain better knows to develop those networks.


Now Medications are not a universal band aid that ""papers over the problem."" They are a legitimate treatment that helps the ADHD kid though.  That said meds work best when combined with non med treatments that modify the environment of the ADHD kids.  This is where parents and teachers come in for if they are taught what they need to do they can really help their kids.

I really put a lot of thought to the ""psychology"" of the room so that when I get super forgetful I can just think ""Well, where would an office item go? Where would I have out a drawing item?""

The trick is being mindful enough to follow my own thoughts but at least having an established ""zone"" has provided SOME order when done right.

Well you're obviously not handicapped or in a great deal of pain. 

Try to imagine for a moment that you're elderly and every day of your life is spent in excruciating pain, and you can't drive yourself anywhere. Because of those first two things, you're also quite poor.  

Any trip you have to take outside the home requires so much effort that it will be the only thing that you can do that day,.

Now - how do you get yourself back and forth to the doctor's office and then the pharmacy? 

And how does it affect your life when you have to do it extra times because the doctor isn't thinking? 


If you having trouble with this scenario, imagine someone attacked you with an axe and destroyed significant portion of your lumbar spine region and damaged your cervical spine.  After surgery, you can still walk, but your legs hurt all the time and 3 vertebrae in your neck had to be fused, with some damage to the arm and hand nerves. 

Everything is difficult and painful, and driving is now nerve wracking but you live alone and don't have anyone who can drive you around. Public transport is out because you can't walk very far. 


Now try living like that and see how painful and frustrating it is to have to make extra trips to the doctors office.

"8144","*Note I am not a doctor or medically trained*

Sounds like you had receptive aphasia [Link to Webmd for a quick summary, I am quoting webmd below](http://www.webmd.com/brain/aphasia-causes-symptoms-types-treatments)
&gt;Receptive aphasia (fluent): With receptive aphasia, the person can hear a voice or read the print, but may not understand the meaning of the message. Oftentimes, someone with receptive aphasia takes language literally. Their own speech may be disturbed because they do not understand their own language.

To my understanding (once again not medically trained) Aphasia is caused by four different causes

* Stroke
* Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) a temporary stroke where there was a blockage but the clot dissolved
* Migraines
* Seizures

You really need to talk to your doctor about this even if you are no longer experiencing Aphasia and it has been years since the last episode.  If it was caused by a seizure you may be a person that it is more likely to have seizures than the general population, for the chance of seizures is not the same throughout the human population, some people are more likely to get them than others.  **Many forms of medications change the occurrence of seizures by lowering or raising the seizure threshold.** Almost all forms of ADHD meds (stimulant and non stimulant) affect the seizure threshold in a minor or major way.  Furthermore the dosage and whether there is a multiple drug interactions can further exacerbate the effects.

You and your doctor need to be mindful of this.  This is something all your doctors (if you have multiple) should be aware of.  Make sure you write it down and do a reminder so you tell your doctor.","ci8e2mz",5,1402869692,"2014-06-15 22:01:32"

"8150","Disclaimer: you are about to get a brain dump from me. 

To the write it down and make a list in another comment. I’ve never had that work for me. But recently, I’ve figured out that if I break it down smaller than seems necessary it works wayyyy easier. Obviously this is still not going to work for everyone, but I figured I’d share cuz I like learning what works for others so I can try it too.

I have my to-do list for the day. I will only assign a max of 6 things to the list for the day, any more and I’m overwhelmed and can’t get past the emotional wall of awful. 

Two items on the list are must do’s, they get highlighted. If I get nothing else done today I want to get those done. I typically try to avoid having must-do’s that have sub-lists (like cleaning rooms). These must-do’s ensure that the time sensitive things get done, and  help me have less zero days (they definitely still happen sometimes though).

Then larger tasks, like cleaning our bedroom, have a sub list that is on a different paper. (Side note: I use a bullet journal for these lists so that I don’t have to keep track of multiple sheets of paper.) I have a check list for cleaning our room that breaks it down into every single step: pick up clothes, put away books, strip and remake  bed, take out trash, dust surfaces, vacuum, check hamper &amp; run laundry if over halfway full, etc. This way when I’m doing the task of cleaning none of my executive function energy needs to go into remembering tasks or deciding what needs to happen. 

I have very little ability to assess whether or not a room is reasonably/livably clean/organized until it is in utter chaos. But I can pick up all the laundry on the floor; I can strip our bed and change our sheets; I can vacuum. I can’t initiate/notice these tasks independently, but I can pick four things off the cleaning list each day. 

It’s also worth noting that on the sub lists I try and make each task take less than 5 mins (ideally only two mins when possible). It helps keep the emotions wall of awful small and easy to get over. I can *usually* force myself to do anything for two minutes. So on bad days I can check a task off then give myself time to recharge before doing another. Also getting to check things off can create momentum (“wow! I already got the four things done and it’s only been like fifteen minutes! I bet I can get a few more done before 30 mins is up!”).

I also keep sub lists on their own pages. Seeing multiple lists at once can cause a melt down because my brain thinks it needs to do everything right now, even if I logically understand that I don’t.

So anyway, OP, for chores around the house creating a chore journal might help. (100% ask him if he would be ok with it and if he thinks it could be helpful *before* doing it because I know friends who this could immediately overwhelm and/or upset/offend). It would be a lot of work on the front end for you to establish/create, but he would be able to have some independence in deciding what he does that day and you wouldn’t need to specifically ask about as many things. You’d need to discuss the system and criteria for doing things (picking up one sick off the floor does not qualify for one of today’s boxes, even though it is appreciated... not that I ever do this to make myself feel better or anything....) and what both of your expectations are for it (can you check the book when you go to do tasks too? Do you have your own book? Or is it a family book? Do chores overlap for both of you or is one person responsible for somethings and not for others?) 

Also, I would check out the YouTube channel *How to ADHD*. Jessica is amazing and is so helpful with explaining symptoms, how to manage them, troubleshooting roadblocks, etc. And she has some awesome videos on what it’s like to live with ADHD. 

As frustrated as you are with him, I’ll bet he is just as, if not more frustrated with the situation. We feel like those tasks *should* be easy too and we don’t understand why they are *not* for us. The wall of awful associated with many “simple” tasks is paralyzing and terrifying, and we don’t know why. Externally, the result of this might be continuing to watch tv or play on our phones (or replying to other ADHD reddit posts.....) but internally we are squirming or screaming at ourselves to get up and start. It often feels like my body and my brain aren’t connected. Or like I have two beings inside my brain, my adult self and a toddler. I need to keep the toddler occupied and content in order to get anything done. Sometimes that means studying at a coffee shop, sometimes it’s listening to an audiobook while folding laundry, sometimes the toddler needs all my attention and I end up playing video games all day. It’s exhausting. 

Medication has made the biggest different for me in this regard. Life is still hard, but meds are like putting the toddler in daycare for a few hours. I still need to have systems in place to learn the necessary skills to get things done and manage my time, but it is so much easier to do when you aren’t also having to regulate how much sensory input you’re getting.

I also want to add that my brain is noisy at all times when I’m not on meds. Imagine going to a party, all that sound around you. Now imagine not being able to tune anyone out to have a conversation; everyone is speaking at the same time, about different things, right next to you. That is what it is like inside my head (and what it’s like being at a social gathering actually). So while I’m having a conversation with you, my brain is feeding me all sorts of extra information that *it* thinks will be helpful (it’s usually wrong). That’s why I have to ask so many times what you said. I was listening to you tell me about the dishes, but my brain heard dishes and started feeding me extra thoughts about dinner, tomorrow’s lunch, that *Hell’s Kitchen* episode from two years ago, what’s that hotel show that Gordon Ramsey did too? It’d be fun to go and visit one of those now, remember when we went to the beach last year, that was really fun, I wonder if we will get to go camping this year, it’s been forever since I’ve had s’mores...... literally all of that, simultaneously, before you finish your sentence. And trying to bring my focus back in feels like when you catch a tuna when you’re deep sea fishing and are trying to reel it in. It’s *hard*. 

So I have you repeat yourself, sometimes three or four times before I can get my brain to shut up enough to process what you said to me

This is also why being asked three or four questions, or being given three or four tasks is hard. Holding a thought in the front of my mind is difficult when my brain is feeding me so much extra information that it thinks is absolutely urgent and needs attention. (You’ll often heat me mumbling my task to myself while I’m doing it so I don’t forget what I’m doing mid action and stop to do something else. Cuz I can usually pull up the last three words that I *just* said because on the feeling in my mouth. Don’t ask me to explain that one because I have no idea what it means).

Anyway, that’s about where my brain dump ends. I don’t know if any of that will be helpful on a practical level. But maybe it’ll give a bit of incite into his head. And I don’t mean to give the impression that this should let him off the hook, he still needs to step up and do his part as your spouse. But knowing what he is managing might help you be able to support and encourage him better so he in turn can support and encourage you fully too. 

My husband and I have only been married for a few years, but we’ve been dating since I was 18. It’s hard for him to understand what it’s like living in my head. I know in some ways he has felt like he is married to a child, having to remind me to do things, making sure I didn’t forget something important (like turning the stove off or blowing out a candle). But with his help and support I’ve grown a lot and found I am much more capable than I knew. When you grow up as a gifted kid with ADHD you hear a lot about potential, so many things come naturally to you, and the adults around you constantly wonder aloud why you don’t just try harder, how amazing you’d be I’m if you just worked harder. But what they don’t see or understand is how much emotional work goes into simple tasks like getting out your homework. So you stopped doing those things. And now as an adult you *need* to do those tasks, like chores, to live a healthy life. So we are all trying to figure that out now.

You’re husband is so blessed to have a wife that wants to understand him and his brain so you can support him as best as you can.

As for hyperactivity, I know it's in the name but you shouldn't focus too much on that as a symptom it's less common in girls for example and tends to decrease as the patient ages anyway the focus issues are a better thing to think about here.

"8152","Hi sillywillyphil! I totally get what you are saying. 

""one day I stopped as I felt I didn't need to take these medications"" This is a pretty common thing - you didn't feel you needed them because they were working! But without them you were vulnerable to trying to replace that dopamine somehow. Don't beat yourself up about it, addiction and ADHD are common together. 

I was diagnosed late in life, and it explained all my addictive behavior, including doing coke every day for about 4 years right before my diagnosis. It hasn't always been easy convincing my doctors that I need my stimulant meds, as they are reluctant to put me on them due to my history. I have tried non-stimulant meds but they do very little for me (your mileage may vary, so it is worth a try). Finally I did have to point out to my doctor that I was much more in danger of falling back into street drugs without them and I would rather be on a monitored dose. 

You should of course be perfectly honest with your doctor. And everyone, including yourself. It is far easier than remembering which lies were told where, I know. 

Ask them about the non stimulants, try those first - and if you need the stims after trying this for a few months you will then have a good relationship with your doctor and they should be willing to trust you.

My father has suffered from Type I manic depression for most of his adult life, certainly for as long as I remember, as well as a few bouts of melancholic depression, and schizophrenia to top it off.  It had a major impact on my family and childhood growing up.  I left home out of high-school and hardly ever looked back.  I do recall in college having periods of depression and contemplating whether or not I had inherited it from my father.  The mania coupled with fear helped me push those thoughts aside though. 

My experience with Ritalin was much of the same. I'm pretty sure I had that same thought the first time I took it too.  It was great because it, for the most part, replicated how I was when I was ""normal and productive"" (manic).  Taking a pill was like flipping a switch.  My doc took me off it because he was concerned with heart health, being over 30 and all.  He put me on wellbutrin, but I never managed to remember to take regularly.

I'm starting week 3 of clinical trial for dasotraline, a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor.  It was originally developed for major depressive disorder, but is now being retooled/trialed as an ADHD med. The first week was pretty good, I couldn't quite ""feel"" anything, but I noticed I was able to go for hours working on one thing.  I remembered to do things, and do them early.  I brushed off things that I would usually dwell, worry or obsess over.  My appetite also decreased, which was a good thing.  I often over eat -- I'm guessing to self-medicate with endorphins.  Week two was not the best as I was unable to get more than 4 hours of sleep a night, on average.  I think my serotonin, epinephrine and dopamine levels have peaked to a level my brain &amp; body have never experienced before for such a prolonged period.  I'm hoping I will adjust over this next week, but this is a trial so even if this turns out to be the med for me, it could be years before I could ever get it Rx.  

Soon it will be back to square one, but I do thank you for your posts as they have provided me with an idea of a direction I at least need to investigate.  I need to get off this track.","cz5xxme",1,1453338557,"2016-01-21 01:09:17"

"8175","Been on 80mg strattera since October of 2015, so several months now. The Lexapro is huge for anxiety for me, maybe not so much with depression? the reason I mention it for ADHD is that anxiety makes it much harder for me to do anything productive, I find my thoughts mostly circling around ways to get rid of the anxiety instead of completing the task at hand, which puts me further behind and increases anxiety and forms a very nasty feedback loop. 

I can definitely see the dangers with adderall, I've had addiction problems in the past which is why the doctors have pushed me to try other non-stimulant solutions first. I was mostly functional even though the ADHD was pretty obvious until my early 20s, was near the top of my class in highschool and graduated undergrad without much of an issue but had it all come apart during graduate school. Since I had this sort of pattern my psych and therapist explained that the depression/anxiety is what pushed me into the realm of problematic ADHD symptoms. So far my experience with all the various medications (strattera, lexapro, ritalin, wellbutrin, adderall, concerta, xanax... not to mention caffeine, nicotine, medical marijuana and various other illicit drugs) has led me to believe that  nothing is going to 'fix' me and suddenly make everything work better.

"8186","If staying in school means you don't have to leave the country, then I'd suggest taking as LIGHT a load as possible. Drop what you can, continue ONLY with the easiest and lowest number of courses you can in order to stay.

ADHD is absolutely manageable. It is persistent, it is hard for people to relate to or understand, and the effects can be severe, but it is absolutely something you can learn to manage and control. The thing is, that takes a lot of time and effort. You won't get there over night or within a month. It's a life skill that gets better over time with practice.

Right now, no, you won't be able to control it. If you're like me, whatever methods you were using to ""cope"" before your diagnosis have probably begun to feel entirely useless. You might begin to feel ""stuck"" between the new understanding you have of how you operate internally and how you want to act externally. With the stress of being in the middle of a school semester and the nagging feeling that you're ending your life before its even had a real chance to begin, you may feel worse than ever.

The thing is that this is totally normal. This is supposed to be hard. See yourself slowly sliding into a downward spiral and realize that knowledge is power. What little knowledge you've gained so far has given you a real understanding of your situation, and the knowledge you continue to gain will allow you to shape your future how you want.

The focus right now should be damage control. Put out what fires you can, continue attending the classes you MUST, and start reaching out and looking into local support immediately. Next time you see your doctor, make sure to get info on a psychologist or a therapist. Talking to people openly about what you experience with ADHD is pretty much universally difficult. People have no idea how to properly deal with it because they just can't really relate. To them, it may seem dramatic or like a self-inflicted problem. Talking to someone who actually understands and whom can offer guidance on ways to work through it will be what ultimately turns your life around.

If you can't shake the anxiety or negativity, consider that your current medication MAY be linked to that as well. Again, it's hard to say, especially at the very start. You're stressed, your life feels like it's falling apart, and you're struggling to gain a solid understanding on what this disorder means for you. To feel like shit and to feel really scared is normal.

Just don't let yourself turn away from everything and shut down. It's normal to feel paralyzed, but inaction will only hurt you in the long run. Take a deep breath.

Things CAN be okay. There's no guarantee either way, but all that means is that at least you have a say in how things go from here.","cvplsfl",1,1444094863,"2015-10-06 01:27:43"

I metabolize meds quickly and have to take larger doses of things even though I’m a smaller person. So idk if you just recently switched or recently upped your dose but my advice would be to track your meds and how you feel in writing and take that record to your doctor so they can help you figure it out.

"8213","I never had difficulties learning. I've  always loved learning and gaining knowledge, but I've always had trouble with following the program, so to speak. Throughout high-school, middle school, and elementary school I had very high test scores. I could absorb and retain information very proficiently. I did, however, have a hard time meeting deadlines. I've always been an intense procrastinator, and all too often I would completely forget about assignments, all together.

In college, I was always very involved during lectures and genuinely enjoyed interacting in class discussions. The main thing I had trouble with was time management, scheduling, and planning. I was always rushing to complete papers and projects the night before they were due. 

My diagnosis is ADHD-PI. Primarily inattentive, and it's been my experience that my inattentiveness kicks into high gear when I'm obligated to do something I don't find enjoyable. To someone who doesn't have or doesn't understand ADHD, this can come off as a lack of self discipline or pure laziness, but it's not. Before starting medication, I tried so hard to get organized and manage my time more efficiently, but to no avail. I can't tell you how many day planners, dry erase boards, and giant calendars I've purchased; all with the intent of finally becoming more organized. Too bad I could never remember to use them on a consistent basis. 

Many people with ADHD have learning difficulties, but not all. For a lot of us, myself included, our main issues are executive function and maintaining focus. I do things out of order and can be distracted by anything, including my own wandering thoughts. My ADHD hasn't prevented me from learning, but it has prevented me from performing as well as I know I'm able to.

If it is ADHD  - your brain is under stimulated. Consequently you’re looking for ways to compensate through external stimulation (mindlessly scrolling through social media, Reddit, YouTube videos, video games, impulsive decisions, etc)

"8219","TechAlchemist has said the important stuff. As far as *knowing* causes or how exactly drugs work - we don't.

*However* I can make a comparison to non-medicated states of mind, which shows roughly how they can both be involved.

Us ADHDers, we know what we have trouble with. We also, most of us, can pinpoint situations where we *don't* have nearly the same problems with motivation and focus. Generally, these situations tend to be either A) high-stress, fast-paced, imminent-deadline-pressure things, and/or B) highly interesting, enjoyable, stimulating activities with some elements of immediate feedback.

Norepinephrine is also called noradrenaline - it's a stress chemical. As both a neurotransmitter in the brain and a hormone in the blood it's a big part of the fight-or-flight response. Guess what? 🙂 Stressful situations like A) create naturally higher levels of norepinephrine.

Dopamine, of course, is the reward chemical, which mobilises many brain circuits related to pleasure, rewards, desire, etc. This is an important chemical for making us want to do things and motivates us to do them again if we got a dopamine hit the first time. Also very implicated in the neurology of addictions. And of course, enjoyable situations with rewards like B) create naturally higher levels of dopamine in the brain. 🙂

So, whether by stress or by pleasure, both of these neurotransmitters are involved in lots of the stuff ADHD brains have trouble with. Because we don't know the exact cause of ADHD (there could be many root causes), it's possible that some people with ADHD have more trouble with the norepinephrine stuff, and benefit more from a medication that addresses this.","drttpnw",2,1514400792,"2017-12-27 18:53:12"

I felt like I had to fake missing *any* of the shapes in the test. I remember looking at my results and realizing I may even score better than the control (non-ADHD) group if I'd been honest. I just wanted to try the meds, but it wasn't what I was hoping for. 

I was just posting to see if anyone else had experienced the sluggishness I felt with it, and had better results with something else. But thanks for the overview! I haven't brought up the idea with my therapist because I don't currently have health insurance and we haven't dissected my possibly having ADHD yet, because god there are so many other things to talk about. I've also honestly always been weary about having to take any medication daily aka having to rely on medication... but I do think about if it could change my life or something, or help me to change it anyway.","dtb4bnk",3,1517029107,"2018-01-27 04:58:27"
"8221","This is so encouraging.

"8222","Good luck!! That doesn't surprise me - my husband has GAD and a lot of times it can look like ADHD on the outside. I eventually realized a big difference is that with my ADHD, some anxiety is helpful because it can create a sense of urgency, which then motivates me to get things done. For my husband, his anxiety was creating mental blocks and preventing him from engaging with a stressful task. 

I eventually realized we have this totally different relationship with anxiety. When I was undiagnosed/unmedicated for my ADHD I basically used my co-morbid anxiety as a stimulant - it wasn't always enjoyable, but it could kick me into hyperfocus easily. Forget something/fuck something up/wait too long to start --&gt; get anxiety --&gt; use that anxiety to fuel hours of frantic hyperfocus --&gt; stop feeling anxious because things got done and am now emotionally spent. Rinse. Repeat. 

I developed this as a coping mechanism and created a twisted reward system with my own anxiety and also didn't realize this wasn't normal. For my husband, anxiety has been more of a crippling and less-friendly experience and addressing that issue has helped a lot with things that I thought were ADHD symptoms.","ehvayem",1,1551820709,"2019-03-05 21:18:29"

"8224","That’s a good and complex question for me.  But I could put the answer into one word:

substantially

I’ll expand on that a bit.  I would not be where I am, who I am and how I am.

I would not have moved across the country from my family.  My mother and father would have understood why I was smart but not motivated and had a plan for me to adapt and thrive.  My classmates probably would have still bullied me for being different.  Some of my teachers would not have bullied me for being different.  I would have had some understanding and positive support from my teachers and my parents.

The success I have had in life was a result of a willingness to adapt amidst a steady stream of negative reinforcement, stress, shame and lack of understanding.  I wanted to succeed because I perceived that the world did not want it.

That drove me for a long time.  On the outside I was in a good place.  On the inside it was an isolated, bitter and self-medicating existence.  I have other people that count on me.  Having that kind of existence within was going to become a failure that impacted people more precious than myself.

So I finally got an evaluation, which led to medication and therapy.  It’s going to be a long road to a better place but it’s worth it for myself and those I love.

I wish I had been evaluated earlier.  I wish my parents had the tools and the understanding to help.  It would have made things a lot easier.

In my opinion, a 504 plan and medication for a child with an established pattern of struggling is not a matter of if.  It’s a matter of when.  If this is the situation you’re in, I think you will find a way and it will change the course of your child’s life.

I’m rooting for you.

It sounds like you’re trying to like a bunch of things you’re just not that into. Or, maybe you’re like me where what you like doing most is whatever your closest friend at the time is into.

In any case, my guidance would not be to stop trying things, but to start being intentional about finishing things — even if you do so imperfectly. The loose ends sound like the most frustrating part of the situation.

Either finish them, or learn to let go and be grateful for what fun they gave you, and what they taught you. 

In my early 20’s I picked up a bunch of random skills in shallow ways. In my early 30’s, pulling bits of those skill sets into my day job makes me extremely effective in a variety of ways that others aren’t.

When some one sees you as a friend and you suddenly change it is less likely they still like you. If you was more yourself you probatly will atrackt people that are more compatible with you. Socializing can be very hard with adhd, i personally have really stuggled with it and i really had to see what i did wrong and try to change that and get out of my comfort zone. Realize that you are a bit behind with social skills meaning that you still have to be actively working on them. I also think it would be good if you talked to someone that can really benifit you social skills. It is possible i am completly wrong but i hope you don't give up on your social skills.

Part of ADHD management requires a healthy lifestyle, that's the biggest thing after medication. I make sure to exercise, get walks in, meditate, do yoga, to help myself feel calm and self-assured to help avoid the negative criticism spiral of my work. I frequently try to remind my SO when my meds have worn off so he knows I'm transitioning back into full ADHD mode, and to know that I get a bit of anxiety when I'm coming down. I also keep a super basic bullet journal for all my deadlines and personal to-do lists, if you google it, I don't do those crazy fancy ones, I just stick to the original version -- black pen, notebook, basic lists. 

One of the biggest things I had to do when I got diagnosed was learn to be realistic -- we are so not realistic with ADHD, we have a very very very poor concept of time (I use a watch that has vibrations to remind me to pay attention or stay on task now). We're usually super optimistic about what we WISH we could get done and kind of take that at face value and usually are completely wrong.

"8341","I don't know what platform or business area you are learning in, but maybe a change (for learning purposes) to something that gets your juices flowing would do you good and start a positive feedback/motivation cycle.

If you like games, the fantasy consoles [TIC-80](https://tic.computer/) and [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) are great fun. They are full development environments with code, sprite and music editors, so you can full screen and block out the world of distraction, and you code and then run what you just entered, so there's no getting daunted by code-&gt;build-&gt;run or code-&gt;deploy cycles. They are basically like the 8 and 16 bit home computers and consoles I grew up with, but with a modern high level programming language (Lua, and/or JavaScript in TIC-80). Both have a built in browser so you can play other peoples' games and learn from their code.

pico-8 is proprietary ($15) but has a bigger community around it and better documentation. TIC-80 is free and has a slightly higher resolution (a bit like a widescreen Commodore 64).

Neither of them are going to teach you web or app development for work, but they will give you plenty of practise in the basic principles of programming, and in breaking down an idea into manageable chunks.

If you are at all into music, try the music coding environment [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net) which lets you learn about programming while making music in Ruby.

For example I've been fixated on being able to hold a handstand and do a press handstand which is why I did at least some strengthening exercises every day for a while. Not a full workout (except for the rare cases when I knew I was going to shower that evening anyway) and certainly no cardio, but at least it was something. And I did get better at handstands. Problem were A) I pulled as muscle and B) my wrists after a while, they started hurting and I wouldn't stop until it was too hurtful which made it only worse. And then... I kinda lost my fixation.

Last year (for about exactly 1 year) I was obsessed with going to the gym and building muscle and protein and stuff. The good thing was that I did do a little steady state cardio and hiit too. I realized I went over the top at some point and wanted to go a little slower then.

I was undiagnosed during college. Taking the time to break shitty assignments down into smaller parts and dividing the work up over several days helped me immensely. This is basically what I'd do:

* Review the assignment instructions and grading rubric (hopefully you have one if it's worth 40% of your grade), and write down or highlight all the important info. I didn't want to lose points for something as stupid as improper formatting.

* Break down the assignment into smaller steps and write it all down (I used OneNote, but you can use anything)

* Divide the steps over several days 

Doing this made it easier to just get started on something I was dreading. Dividing it up made it feel much less overwhelming. I also enjoyed marking items off the list, and when I got off track it was much easier to get back to work. 

If you're having trouble reading your sources because of the language try googling a synopsis. I had to do that often in my business law class when we'd have to read through old cases.

I probably am not answering your question directly, but just want to say that discrimination is common. The wrong type of heath professional doesn't know a single thing about ADHD, and would do anything to discourage your pursuit for diagnosis. It's easy to be thought of as a medication-scoring fraud.

I'm not writing the above to discourage you. But I really want to encourage you to seek other health professionals if the first ones are dismissive. There are good, compassionate ones out there, you just have to go on and find them before you get too discouraged.

The visits varied widely, from what I've read here and my personal experience. Some people go through various written and practical tests, some people just have to tick enough boxes in the DSM criteria for ADHD, some needed to bring their past school reports and get parents/friends interviewed.

All in all, go through it with an open mind and don't expect miracles, you'd be fine. Don't get too easily disappointed, because even with diagnosis, it takes a while for you to find the meds that work for you.

I felt so trapped anytime I had to sit still somewhere or stay in one place. A lot of people on these Reddit have the inattentive type ADHD though (no hyperactivity), so it gets talked about a lot less on here. I think the same restlessness can also be a part of anxiety too, so I would just describe what's going on to a doctor and they should be able to tell the difference.

"8383","This seems like a fun challenge from an outsider's perspective. Not fun for you I'm sure. Here are some ideas, in the order I would probably try them:  
\- First of all, I assume you've already tried putting her phone number into google? (a lot of people pop up that way - it's actually kind of unnerving)  
\- if you ever go over to her place, look for a piece of mail (in plain sight- obviously don't dig)  
\- if you watch stuff on her streaming accounts, pay attention to the name on sign in (will backfire if she doesn't use her own account)  
\- ask for her email and tell her you want to send her something- chances are her email will have her name or part of her name in it (you have to come up with something to send though)  
\- Would you have any reason to venmo each other or create a reason? If she venmos you, you'll have her name. If you venmo her, you can just pass your phone and have her find her own handle so you can pay her. I honestly sometimes have such a hard time finding people on there, so I don't think that's suspicious.   
\- Similar to above, do you have a reason to take an uber together? You can say your account is down, have her call the car, and offer to venmo. Then you have two opportunities to get her name (when the driver checks the passenger name + venmo).   
\- 3 months seems like the time to find out her last name. If it's something non-generic, you might be able to use it and details about it to google her and find her linkedin or something. This one seems riskiest because you'd have to bring up names in the first place to find out.

While I'm all for honesty, I don't think you should fess up unless you really really have to. If it were only a couple dates in, it'd be a funny story. After 3 months, I'd be pretty crushed if someone didn't know my name, no matter how casual it was.","g0ad99b",3,1596509617,"2020-08-04 02:53:37"

"8394","There are a few different things at play here. The most important to recognize is that the medication is not a magic bullet. Procrastination, distractions, lack of focus, etc... those are all things people without ADHD suffer from as well. Just because you're now medicated you aren't going to all of a sudden develop healthy habits or a great work ethic. Secondly, 18mg is a joke dose. Especially if you've been self-medicating with stimulants for a long time already 18mg is going to do absolutely nothing. When I first started on Concerta all it did was make it easier to get out of bed in the morning, other than that I noticed no difference. Thirdly, it could be that methylphenidate or concerta specifically are not the medication for you. From what my Dr has told me concerta is expensive but its the medication her patients have been reported the most success with. If the cost of the pils aren't an issue I'd say just work with your physician/therapist to figure out what dose will work for you and if you can't find one it might be time to try a different type. 

I still struggle daily with getting work done. Medication has helped me realize that the problem wasn't me but that the problem is actually my job. So the motivation to get started is still low and I dick around a lot because I have so little interest in doing the work, BUT when I do get started I can burn through something and actually finish it. I can also more easily focus on pushing myself to actually get started on things that I know are important. 

I read someone describe it using a messy closet. Off your medication you look at a closet and you just see the mess, it's overwhelming and you have no idea where to start. On medication when you look at the closet you can actually see a pattern to the mess, you can see how it could be organized and you can visualize how it would look once it's done. At the end of the day though you still need to want to clean the closet. I'm still not doing great when it comes to my day job but I've accomplished quite a bit in relation to personal goals and hobbies.","d0c6huz",3,1456336632,"2016-02-24 17:57:12"
"8395","Say nothing about your sleep schedule? Negative on that one. That is one of the PRIME reasons you're in this situation. This should be top priority on your life right now if it is hampering your ability to complete school work this much. 

The key here is you were up until 4AM. School should not be an activity that keeps you up that late, especially because you have ADHD and it deprives you of the very sleep you *require* to avoid getting into this vicious cycle of late nights and procrastination. 

Having a mostly regular sleep schedule will help keep you productive. More importantly, however, is the time you go to sleep. If you can establish a routine where you go to bed consistently at the same time every evening, you are doing two things for yourself:

1) You are setting an earlier deadline for yourself then your class deadline. If your work is not finished by your sleep deadline, you then have to wake up earlier to compensate and complete the work, but that is OK because you had a chance to recuperate sleep and be more productive when you need to catch up on this work. This is difficult to do and it took me years to figure, out but once you get in the habit of it you realize his is how normal productive people succeed in life. 

2) You are getting the sleep you absolutely require, especially with ADHD. Burning the midnight oil is one of the worst habits you can get into with ADHD as it severely limits your executive function ability. Find a healthier alternative such as described here and work on changing your habits. It will take some time, but you will appreciate the immense impact it will make on your life.

"8420","The title of that article is somewhat misleading, as the article itself says ""Young children who die by suicide are less likely to have depression and more likely than their adolescent counterparts to have attention\-deficit disorder \(ADD\) or attention\-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \(ADHD\), new research shows.""  The important distinction here is that rather than people  \(under 12, that is, at least, if it is going off of this study [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22926661](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22926661)\) with adhd being more likely to commit suicide than those with depression, it is that more people with adhd commit suicide than those with depression in that age group.  This is arguably more important \(as it means that *more people are killing themselves* because of this, and thus could be useful to better prevent further suicide\), but it is also probably because depression is very rare in these age groups and usually develops in adolescence.","dwubrdo",1,1522914522,"2018-04-05 07:48:42"

"8446","Doing well in school was a HUGE reason I wasn’t diagnosed sooner!! I was diagnosed at age 34 after being in nursing school pre-req classes and struggling SO MUCH. After talking through it with a psychologist and a PMHNP (Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner), we realized that I always did well in school because I was thankfully mostly in situations that allowed me to work at my own pace: private Catholic school for K-8 and a Jesuit all boys school for freshman year. In K-8, the school realized that if I had to work at the pace as everyone else, I would be a huge distraction. So they let me do my work as fast as I wanted and then made me go fix computers, organize different science labs, etc. 

It all fell apart sophomore year when I transferred to a traditional public high school. Grades plummeted and I was skipping class all of the time. I dropped out and six months later enrolled in an alternative high school that allowed me to work at my own pace. BOOM. Finished three years of high school in 18 months.","er9gunv",2,1560623652,"2019-06-15 18:34:12"

"8448","Just letting you know, this feeling won't last forever. It's very common to have this euphoric feeling for the first month or so, but after a while it starts to go away. The focus will stay though. 

Don't do what I did... When I started feeling it go away I would skip days and bump up on my dosage just to get that feeling back. I did whatever I could to make it stay. It ended up really fucking up my sleep cycle and I would have bad mood swings on the days that I didn't take it.

However, I do a lot to keep myself happy and motivated to the point where it almost feels like I just started taking it. It's mostly little things but it helps so much with my overall mood.

Like for example, I keep my room very clean and organized all of the time. Having a messy room for some reason makes me feel unmotivated. I listen to a lot of music especially when I'm driving. I'm very organized, I have a planner and I just my calendar a lot. Having the perfect lighting and the right study environment, for me its somewhere well lit with a lot of people. Going to the gym helps a lot. 

Probably my most helpful one is just to fake it till you make it. There are a lot of days where even with adderall I feel like shit, so those days I'll actually pretend that I feel great. Like I'll look myself in the mirror and say ""You're gunna kill it today, you handsome mother fucker"". I know its ridiculous and silly but I end up laughing at the shit that I say and it actually does make me feel better.

"8449","Not really treatments, but a bunch of coping strategies that could be working:
 
*noise cancelling headphones. great for learning and spicing up boring chores

*make your space impulse friendly and simplify it. Assign everything you own a space, slowly sort through your stuff, look for tasks you often do and think about how you could make them easier/more efficient. (For example trashcans in every room, baskets to carry around stuff, buying tools multiple times if you need them at different rooms so you always have them at hand(cleaning supplies maybe))

*practice meditation/mindfulness, anything that can help you focus more in the moment. Takes a while, but it helps

*focus on small daily goals instead of big ones. Think of small steps that don't even really break your habits because they are so tiny. Go to bed 10 minutes earlier. Make your bed in the morning. Change one item in your shopping list for something healthier. Take a short extra walk/slightly longer route while you've been outside for an appointment.

*Don't beat yourself up over where you are now. You can't change it, you can only change where you go. Think about the things you really want to do. How long will it realistically take to achieve those? What exactly can you do to get there? What keeps you from doing those things? Can you change anything at all about it?","dt23p4o",6,1516625442,"2018-01-22 12:50:42"

"8452","Last semester, I had a field assignment that was going poorly due to some personality clashes between a couple of classmates &amp; the people we were assigned to work with. It was a bad combo of some people being thoughtless and others being oversensitive. Basically, your typical office-politics powder-keg. People had to be brought in to mediate. 

I was already stressed to the gills. I really hate conflict and I'm hypersensitive to that kind of passive-aggressive 'cold war' kinda stuff. Plus I'd had a fight with my boyfriend that morning. 

By lunchtime, I was SO DONE. I snuck out a side door &amp; booked it to the nearest mall so I could take 10 minutes, get a latte, walk around and not have to smile at anyone. 

I had just purchased my first car and was not used to mall parking lots. I was in a stress-fog and just made a mad beeline to the coffee shop. 10 minutes later, realized I had NO idea where the car was, and it was in a round parking lot that encircled the mall. 

Spent 20 minutes looking for the car. Finally realized I wasn't going to make it back in time and started hauling ass on foot. I was probably too far away to make it, but was damn well gonna try anyway...in heels. Holding coffee.

Too bad there was an intersection on the way back. Yes, just one intersection. And you could only turn left or right. I chose wrong. 

I missed an entire meeting. I walked BACK to the mall, wandered around in circles until I found the car, then sat in it while I cried and drank the remaining third of my latte that wasn't spilled all over my outfit.

"8461","We feel the neurodiversity movement is harmful to people with ADHD. While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

Words like 'neurodiverse', 'neurodivergent', and 'neurotypical' are political terms coined by the neurodiversity movement and are inextricably tied to it. They are not general-purpose medical or scientific terms. Please use 'people with(out) ADHD' or 'people with(out) mental disorders' instead.

"8464","tldr; For tasks, be accountable to someone you trust. Have a hard deadline. And make your own deadline that's days or hours before that. Get someone you trust to help bother you by intermittently asking ""how are you doing on &lt;task&gt;?""

If I ""have"" to do something, I will tend to do anything else, even on medication. Over the weekend, I was supposed to write a performance self-evaluation, which is good for my job and a necessary thing I have to do. I hate doing these and I have never turned one in on time. 

Instead, I spent hours in hyperfocus on personal work, until I gave myself a deadline (finish your evaluation by 5pm Sunday; the hard deadline for this was 8am Monday), and told my wife and had her check in on me every once in a while. It was a slog, but her prodding brought my attention back. After about 6 hours I had finished it. We celebrated the feeling of relief together.

I feel this way with everything, tasks/assignments, social engagements, fun projects I volunteered for, etc. Anything. But I focused on tasks here, it was fresh on my mind. I have no idea how to overcome resistance to other things. 

Also, for me, asking for help like this was VERY hard to get to. Medication and therapy have gotten me to the point where I can at least let someone in on what I'm doing and ask for their help. ","dn6e1qm",15,1505757198,"2017-09-18 17:53:18"

"8472","A lot of good advice here. 

The one thing I'd like to add, and that has helped me, is making a conscious effort of changing your self talk from one of negativity to one of positivity. Berating yourself on a constant basis destroys your self esteem, and can place you in a state of depression and hopelessness (I'm speaking from personal experience having ADD and EDD). Telling yourself you're capable, that you'll be fine, that you can and will overcome challenges, that you're worthy, will make you more confident. Also, ignoring, and even refuting (in self talk) external negative comments will also help tremendously. When you have ADHD and other comorbidities, you will have a very steep mountain to climb, just like others without it, but if you can focus on pushing yourself to being YOUR best (not what you think others expect), and tell yourself daily you will reach the top, you'll be fine!","gnhcawo",2,1613347668,"2021-02-15 00:07:48"

But anyway nearly everything I’ve either struggled with has almost be attributed to ADHD in one way or another... weight gain- poor impulse control, “firey temper- emotional regulation issues, even the way I struggle to talk sometimes is in some way attributed to the condition somehow ADHD is so much more than being hyper or distracted, if you get a chance have a read about “executive functions” and just how much ADHD is involved, on the upside however if medication is an option for you they really do help out with most the stuff said above. I’ve been on ritilin for about a month and have been able to finally drop below 95 kg for the first time in 2 years, I don’t snap at the little things as much as I used to and my ability to actually string along a sentence without loosing words feels like I’m finally able to talk like everyone else...

We know that when estrogen drops, dopamine also drops. Many women describe having their meds suddenly become ineffective right before and at the very beginning of their period, which is when estrogen suddenly drops. 

I quite often get a symptom that I call “nobody loves me everybody hates me” day, where I suddenly feel like I have no friends, and if I called anyone they wouldn’t really want to talk to me, etc. etc. It comes on abruptly, and it took me a while to realize that it’s pinned exactly to the day before my period starts. 

So that seems to me pretty strong anecdotal evidence that this mood/RSD, which borders sometimes on paranoia, and not based on actual facts, is tied to neurotransmitters, specifically dopamine. ","eablvfe",3,1543007932,"2018-11-23 21:18:52"

"8502","Hey. I have ADHD. I was 'diagnosed' somewhere between the age of 12 &amp; 14.

You do not have a disability. You have a superpower.

They wanted to give me medication when I was a kid and I refused for mainly 2 reasons. I knew there was nothing wrong with me and that the pill will only make the lives of the people around me easier.

I realized that ADHD is quite simply an excess of energy. So I found ways to channel that energy, and man O man, I love it. I have a superpower and I have no trouble telling people about it. Yes this power comes with some consequences. But with effort and discipline, you'll get the best benefits with the least downsides.

I strongly believe that ADHD, among many other ""disorders"", are misunderstood or maybe even lazily treated with pills.

You have the opportunity to be unique, don't let anyone make you feel bad about that. It's human nature to react negatively to someone out of the norm. After all, the definition of normal is *conforming to a standard; usual, typical, expected.

... that the saying in a way turns out to be true, that 'God doesn't give you more than you can bear'. For some of us they have a fart of ADHD and complain how bad their life is. For others there is a thunderstorm and they can't get anything done. But it all scales with the person.

"8536","How'd the new dosage go? I'm curious if you'll be able to sleep. 18mg had no perceptible effect for me (though I was subtly better focused) so I really have no idea how it might play out. 

I didn't grasp the concept of titration until I experienced it. If I was just assigned 18mg with no reevaluation I might have been like 'well  it's better than it was, I guess it works.' And would probably keep refilling it with only slight improvement. 

Hitting my ceiling at 45 was alarming, especially when I forgot to take it one lazy Sunday and ended up sleeping for some 14 hours (don't remember exactly but I woke up at 7am and couldn't tell if it was morning or night). I couldn't risk that happening during my work week. 

(Side note: it's super frustrating having to keep taking a dosage that scares you a little because it's so hard to access your healthcare providers. In my state I have to bring the physical copy of the prescription to the pharmacy and my psych is 40 minutes away, so even if I could call and get a new one written at a lower dose, I'd have to miss a couple hours of work anyway just to drive there and pick up the paperwork.)

36 is good for me, but sometimes I feel really impatient because others aren't as quick to get on the same page as I am, and I can feel hurried to get certain things done--say, buying groceries before a picnic, I should enjoy shopping with friends because it's a day off and it's casual shopping and should be fun but I'm rushing it and sorting groceries by temperature, with my card and car keys in my hand while I'm waiting in the checkout line. 

That's a slightly extreme example though. Idk, my psych jumped from 18 to 36 and up to 45, then down to 36 but I wasn't taking it consistently and felt rocky so I asked for 27, then I took that regularly and liked it but ran out so I started taking my saved-up 36's again in the meantime. Phew. I like the 36 for being perceptible and efficient but the 27 might be more stable. I'll have to choose between high-performance and high-functioning (socially) I guess, and even then I'll have days where the meds just seem to make me impulsive. 

Sorry for how long that got. 

And yes, I do the math game when driving too. 60 mph matches nicely with 60 minutes per hour and it seems like that should give some assurance about arriving on time but nope.

"8545","I went to church yesterday and had the fun of sitting through a sermon in which the guy basically said ""if you just pray and follow the bible, you as a Christian shouldn't ever have to suffer from depression or a mental disorder! Why I know of a guy who committed suicide even though his pastor counselled him blah blah blah"".

The pastor was just visiting and very new to being a pastor, but it took all my will power not to give him an informative earful after the sermon. Luckily, my mom reached him before I could and proceeded to teach him about mental health problems in a more polite but stern way. She convinced me to avoid the guy because she could see I had that ""look"".

But now that I'm much more calm about the situation, I think what my mom said afterwards is really something we should keep in mind ""He's not a doctor not a psychologist... he has absolutely no understanding of what causes depression [or other mental health conditions], let alone what it is. All we can do is just correct him so that he doesn't make that mistake again. Pastors [or any other opinionated loudmouth] shouldn't be involved in counselling for that, they are not trained- so just let them know they are wrong or ignore them.""","d27pw1a",3,1460999300,"2016-04-18 17:08:20"

I don't think neurotypical people understand how severe adhd can be for a lot of people, so they think it's not something you should worry about. To them its just Trouble Sitting Still Disorder. When they say stuff like ""it isn't so bad compared to other things"" I think they're *trying* to compliment us, because they think we WANT to be as close to ""normal"" as possible. But adhd is a genuine neurodevelopmental disability, it completely rewires our brain structure. We struggle and need to be understood and accommodated for just like any other condition. So its valid to feel angry when nt people water down your struggles. I also feel shame and like an attention-seeker whenever I complain about a negative adhd trait, but I try to remind myself that just because I don't have it ""worse"" doesn't mean I don't have it bad. My mom overshares to other people about both my mental and physical health, so I completely understand.

Having been on his end, I can say that I know it feels like he's calling you lazy, but he did his very best not to say that because that's not the core of his feeling. I think he was trying to tell you how he felt. There is a huge difference between thinking that your partner is willingly neglecting responsibilities and taking advantage and just feeling burdened by the perception that you're the one who is taking the brunt of the work. This is probably because the things you do are not visible to him.

Relationships being egalitarian isn't always natural. Sometimes it takes the really uncomfortable task of looking at it and giving the reassurance that both partners are equally invested. It sounds like you're putting in a tonne. It has helped my marriage a lot, just knowing that my wife knew how I felt.

Try to set goals that are fairly easy to achieve, and treat anything beyond that as a bonus. Rather than making your life a daily failure by being too demanding of yourself.

This is very helpful way of framing tasks when your brain gets overwhelmed and gives up easily. You really do have to be kind to yourself and take it slow. It's just a lot less stressful that way.

edit: have any of you ever tried so hard to do something well (to match your expectations) that you end up with everything muddled and overcomplicated and only when it's over do you see clearly how easy it would have been if you just kept things simpler.

In my case, I don't lose things because I've developed habits of checking for my things and keeping them all in specific places, and I'm not late because I've developed a habit of checking the time frequently and overestimating travel times.

My first suggestion would be to talk to your psychiatrist about non-amphetamine based medications. You're young, and the school year is just starting, it would probably not be too difficult to try out a different medication. I could go on about that, but, short term solution, try investing in shakes and smoothies. I'm not an expert on nutrition or diet in any way, but I would assume that drinking a fruit smoothie or carrying around some muscle milk or something like that would be better than not eating at all. If you're like me, liquids still won't be a problem, so this might help. As to the morning, although I love breakfast food, I'm not into eating in the morning either. I started drinking a big glass of milk in the morning every day. Milk, almond milk, hell, even a big glass of juice would be better than nothing at all. That first chunk of calories in the morning makes all the difference in your day, especially as a teenager. Also, if you're not eating, you should think about investing in a daily multivitamin.

This instance itself is little more than textbook reader manipulation- selling partial truths as if they were universal truths, relying on the layman's ignorance, selectively presenting ambiguous wording to allow the reader's logic flaws to lead them to a conclusion that is not outright declared, but subtly inferred.    
            
All of this, of course, performed while discussing extremely specific technical terms to a specialist in his field and never clarifying the precise idiosyncrasies that his usage demands and the context that must be recognized to fully grasp the intent behind his words.      
            
It doesn't get much more blatant than outright lies in the title of the article itself:    
             
&gt;""Inventor of ADHD's deathbed confession: 'ADHD is a fictitious disease'""     
                
We know- society, medical science, humanity in general and anyone with the *fucking capacity to google*- that the first statement is an outright lie- a simple query by anyone who posts this junk into any search engine under 'who discovered ADHD' makes it very immediately obvious that diagnosis and treatment of the condition has been going on for over a century *at the very least*.   
             
Leon Eisenberg was, of course, no 'inventor of ADHD'- briefly perusing his wikipedia page alone- the listings of his professional achievements, the section further detailing his advancements in medical science, the CV of his life's work all laid out- and strangely, this accomplishment is nowhere to be found. Obviously. He was, of course, a pioneer in child medicine and psychology- and his contributions to the field were very much beneficial and contributory to developing new models and approaches in diagnosis, treatments, methodologies for a range of childhood psychiatric conditions. Which, of course, means he played a role in modern society's approaches to Adhd.    
              
So, I guess you could say he 'invented ADHD' the way that the Chilean farmer that harvested and shipped fruit from his farm, through a network of individuals between he and I, from one side of the planet to another, passing through multiple nations, corporations, hands and distributors, to the grocery store I purchased it from yesterday and ate it for lunch- that Chilean farmer 'invented' the subsequent bowel movement I had afterwards.    
            
Coz, like, It's all so clearly just a conspiracy by Big Pharma and lazy parents and taking the bible out of school and banning public spanking, don't you agree? It's not like the condition has been diagnosed for centuries or someth- oh, wait.
                   
That garbage alone is reason enough why hostility and condemnation is a perfectly justified response to being presented with blatantly, clumsily, agenda-driven pablum and asked what such a grand revelation evokes in those who have actually lived with the condition.   
              
And I'm not deluding myself with the idea that the OP will even return to own up to posting such ignorant, offensive bullshit.   
              
I just think it's important that I make the effort to convince at least one other person that when this bullshit manifests, it is treated the same way as any other blatant ignorance or bigotry- as if the OP had just walked into a room full of people discussing their shared African and Caribbean heritage and asked them how they felt when they found out that 'science has, like, totally, *completely* proven it's a fact that blacks are lazy and more likely to be criminals'.       
                       
Maybe it's just me- perhaps it is. But I see it as no different than claiming schizophrenia is really demons, vaccines are secret mind control conspiracies, drug addiction is the result of bad choices and poor moral character. These things deserve little more than contempt, and it is a slap in the face to have others presume of me that I am obligated in perpetuity to smile sheepishly and tolerate the harm and ignorance being promoted as though it were even worthy of serious discussion or consideration as a valid viewpoint. It's not, it's ignorant, prejudicial bigotry and agenda driven lies being pushed onto everyone else with the expectation that the liars selling this garbage and the ignorant people pushing it won't be suffering, the people with the condition will bear the real effects of how many people believe the untruths are truths.     
                 
In all honesty, if you have ADHD, like I do- and if, like me, you can sincerely say that it has caused you to suffer throughout your life and had an overarching, universal impact on you-    
              
I merely want you to see these acts as what they are: he just walked in here and asked us how we feel now that  'science has, like, totally, *completely* proven your experience, your struggles, your suffering- the one that has affected your entire life, before you ever knew about ADHD- *it's a lie and you're a liar*'","cal7byv",2,1371561982,"2013-06-18 13:26:22"

"8731","First off, congrats on the weight loss and good job with developing code that allowed you to maximize your work efficiency! 

From what I'm reading, I take it you've lost most of your motivation at your break up because it also took away a source of support and interest. This is normal for you to feel dejected and unmotivated.

What you need to take your mind off of things is a true, barely beyond-reach-goal that will make you wake up and fight for it everyday. If money was no option, where would you live? where would you travel or what would you do? When you can picture that kind of life vividly in your head, figure out what steps you can take right now to get you just a little closer to what you want. Then do that everyday.

For my own goals, I don't picture specific people in my futures to fight for except for family. Because I know people will always come and go (sometimes my fault, other times not) but you should aim for a future where you are happiest. 

If you're the kind of person like me who puts a lot of my life and importance into relationships, you'll also need to learn that with or without that SO, your life will work out just fine in the end. The best person to improve your life for is -you- because you're the one who has to live with you 24/7 to the end. Your life might as well be fun and badass as fuck, right?

Tl;dr - Down feelings strongly correlated to breakup. Mourn, but don't wallow forever. Find a true goal and picture it everyday and work towards it, so that you'll wake up everyday happy and motivated to achieve your ideal life. Eventually good friends and a good s/o will find their way to you and help to complete the picture.","dadepim",1,1479960514,"2016-11-24 04:08:34"

Deep breaths, and step 1: Call your health insurance 800 number, on the back of your insurance card or online with your insurance provider, and ask if mental health services are covered. You may even be able to look it up online if you have a website to log in to.

Alternatively, step 1 is to go to your GP specifically for this problem. Say that Wellbutrin is no longer working, and your life is a mess because you cannot at all function. Ask if s/he can prescribe a different medication, or if s/he can refer you to the proper mental health professional.

After this, do not hesitate to call the GP's office back and ask for help. Or the insurance company. Every single time you are confused, no matter how awkward you feel, call and ask for help with the next step. It should be a matter of GP refers to mental health, mental health evaluates, mental health either refers you back to GP with recommendation for other medication or refers you to psychiatrist for medication (because counselors can't prescribe).

But, simply break it down. Step 1 is to go to the provider your insurance will cover, either GP or mental health, but if you're at all confused or overwhelmed, start with GP and lay it out and ask for the next step.

"8796","So Adderall is the brand name and yes, you can still get it. The question is, is it extended release (capsules) or is it immediate release (tablets)?

The brand name is made by a pharm co. called Shire. You can get the brand name, but in order for you to take advantage of the 0 copay after meeting your deductible, the medication must still be on your insurances formulary. You shoukd also note that it may require a PA (Prior Authorization) from the insurance because it is brand.

From my experience working as a pharm tech, brand adderall is hardly covered without a PA, and even then the copay are not worth it, or the insurance decides it won't authorize the PA. Talk to your MD, talk to your insurance company, and talk to your pharmacist. If I were you, I'd do it in the following order:

1. Call insurance and check if they even cover brand. If they tell you it's not on the formulary, then your search ends there, and they won't cover any of it. If they say it requires a PA, get the OA info from them and then go to step 2. If they say they do, ask for the co-pay, and go to step 3. 

2. Talk to your MD. This is mainly if it requires a PA. drugs like adderall are very sensitive, and different states have different laws and regulations to ensure it is not being handled illegally. Tell your doctor that brand adderall will require a PA, and give them the information the insurance company gave you. Now you play the waiting game. PAs can take a few days to a few weeks. I've seen them go on for months at a time. Make sure you give enough time before you need to refill in order to get the PA completed. Also make sure you follow up with the doctor and the insurance company because they can both drop the ball at times. 

3. Talk to your pharmacist. Make sure you use the same pharmacy as often as possible. Patients that fill at different pharmacies for narcotics are a red flag. Try to work something out with your pharmacist, and tell them you will need to get brand. If your pharmacist needs to order the medication, it will take a few days, sometimes a week, to get in. Medications normally come next day for us, but narcotics are a while other ball game. Pharmacists need to fill out special DEA forms in order to get the drugs. They don't just arrive every week like other meds. 

In this while process, patience is key! Also, be understanding to all parties involved. While you may want the brand name right away, understand that it could take a month or two for everything to get where it needs to be. Make sure to prepare for the worst. And honestly, if the generic is working for you, the worst is just that you don't get the brand name adderall.

WARNING LONG POST

Imagine that from a young age you consistently have been the best or at the top in every academic thing you have done. Early on it was just because you had intuition, not because you were actually smarter. This is where the idea that you must be smart is planted.

You get out of elementary school and wow, middle school is still easy. All of the math is simple still, history is just rehashed stuff of things you know, English classes are almost worthless, and you are getting to do fun science experiments. It is not too hard. You still do reasonably/very well in everything because the reality is, it is not that complex. If you forget to do homework you can just do it 15 minutes before it is due. Sure you get distracted when working but you have very little actual work and studying to do. Hell, you even get a 1600 on the SAT at age 12 because you kinda figured out algebra some during the test. 

Then you get to high school. You go into honors/AP classes because it is expected of you. It isn't so easy anymore. All of the sudden your daydreaming, mental fog, and poor organizational skills start effecting you. All of the sudden if you forget to do an assignment the night before you can't complete it in class, so you start actually doing all of it at home. You still wait until 11PM to do it, but the time pressure and peer pressure is your only real motivation. You ask how long it takes your other successful peers to do their assignments/readings. ""About 2 hours"" they say, well shit you spent double that time to complete it. Do you say anything? No, you are smart, you have always been smart, you can't not be smart. So what do you do? You buckle down and try your fucking heart out. Your other successful friends says ""wow you are so smart"" and ""It is pretty easy right?"" because they don't see you putting in over double their hours to get the same results to slightly better results. They don't see you constantly spacing out at your desk daydreaming and having to reteach yourself later.

Test start getting very difficult because now you have essay questions, and as it turns out mathematics and sciences are starting to ramp up. It isn't intuitive anymore. Suddenly you start running out of time on tests that aren't multiple choice. You know the material, you have ace'd almost every homework, but it is like every sentence is a fucking chore to devise. Every problem is just tedium, ""and wow I wonder how my sister is doing"", no stop that you need to answer the question.

Do you tell anyone the tests are difficult because your thoughts get distracted and cloudy? No, you are smart, you have always been smart, you can't not be smart. You HAVE to be smart. If you aren't smart then you have been living a lie.

Then you take your SAT's and ACT's again. Math and critical reading on these tests are an absolute joke in terms of difficulty. Multiple choice? Check. Multiple incredibly wrong answers? Check. You destroy these tests because you have been working your ass off actually trying to do hard stuff through all of the mental clutter. You get your scores back. Turns out the two sections colleges actually care about you ace. ""Hey, I guess I might be smart after all"". Your friends and family were actually right, and you fulfilled their expectations.

You decide to do a ridiculously hard academic competition. You are smart, right? Turns out, the coach of your schools team expects you to be the one of the top scorers in the state, and possible nationwide. You have to work harder than you ever have and it is barely manageable. You get scored in house, EVERY day. Guess what? You don't get to choose ""not"" to be smart for a day. So what do you do? You out work everyone else in your state. Your attitude is ""fuck the mental fog, fuck everything, I will get 3 hours of sleep at night and sleep during non-useful classes to succeed"". Sure you may have started getting a few B's and a C in other classes. But you are now CRUSHING people nationwide. You did it. You have proven without a doubt that you are smart. You have ALWAYS been smart. Hell, you even got accepted to a great college.

So you go off to college. Hey, you are smart right? You should be able to do this easily. First semester, ""oh wow that wasn't so hard after all,"" you say to yourself. You worked harder during your last two years of high school. Second semester comes by and you start running into serious issues with time management, your procrastination is now starting to kill you. Half A's, half B's, not so bad. That is still pretty smart. You justify it based on your crazy course load. Third semester comes by and you don't have time to procrastinate. You sit at your desk for double the time of people you know to get the same results. You ace the homework, but run out of time on every test you take, to the point where you even fail a few. You know the material, you just can't get it down on the page fast enough. ""Hey wait, I am smart this doesn't happen to people like me, maybe it is a fluke."" Its fine though, you still got all B's overall, but you can kinda ride on your first semester. ""My GPA still says I'm pretty smart. I am still smart right?""

Fourth semester comes, and you are overloaded on classes because you decide you are smart enough. All of the sudden you don't have enough time to do all of your homework and readings. You have friends who are doing the exact same course load and somehow they have a social life while making better grades. You spend almost every waking hour trying your ass off to stay focused and *it is not working*. You have 4-6 hours or so of work to do almost every week day, and that is for other people. It takes you 8-12 hours. Oh you have 3 hours classes everyday where attendance matters? Oh you have to eat? Oh you need to take care of yourself? Oh you want a measly 5 hours of sleep a night? Oh you want to try to maintain your shitty social status? Too bad, you need 28 hour days for that. Somehow, you are hanging on. Then you get sick for a week straight. Now you can't catch up. There is no way for you to do it. You are forced to drop a class. ""Hey wait, smart kids don't drop classes."" Now that you dropped a class you finish the semester with 2 C's, a B, and by the mercy of your one professor a single A. Your academic adviser is a little bit concerned, but you are smart, right? 

*Right?*

So your fifth semester comes and it is just as bad as the fourth. You are frustrated. You are finally about to break. ""Why can't I focus on my work? Why can't I complete any tests in the allotted time? Why can't I pay attention in lectures?"" You still carry on, but it is not going well. You are physically exhausted, staying focused on academics is the hardest thing you have ever had to do in your life. You are stressing out because you don't have any time to do anything you like, you can't focus on the things you have to do, and to top it all off, maybe you aren't smart after all. The reason for why you have been trying, is disappearing. You start skipping classes because you don't have time or the attention to go to them anyways, and your academic adviser gets notified. She wants to talk about why you are missing classes. You go to talk to her, and something she says just breaks you. 

**""You are so smart, you need to try to live up to your potential""**

Try... You need to *try*? You have been working yourself to death every single day for the last year and a half of your life. You have been trying harder than anyone you personally know of and seeing terrible fucking results. ""What is the fucking point anymore? Nothing I do is working. I can't do this. I can't do this. I *can't* do this anymore. I can't, am not smart enough. **I AM NOT SMART**"" [Note: I actual had an emotional break down after this meeting, full on sobbing in my room for days]


Everything about your life is now a lie. The reason you have worked your ass off, the reason you went to college, the reason you are who you are, is false. Then it hits you like a fucking bag of bricks. You aren't smart, smart doesn't exist, you just work incredibly fucking hard because you and everyone you know *thinks* you are smart. You are no longer smart, because smart is just used as a way to reduce the value of hard work. Maybe then, there is actually a reason that all of your time and effort that was put into trying to fulfill these expectations was less valuable than others. You have the drive. You know it is there, because even if you aren't smart, people still think so and you care about their opinions.

You call your doctor, get referred to a specialist, and wouldn't you know it you have ADHD-PI. Lo and behold there is a fucking reason for it,

Turns out being able to do well in school through trying to live up to people's expectations can mask a lot of the symptoms. I am incredibly disorganized and forgetful. I have terrible procrastination if I am given any free time and struggle to not daydream if something isn't the most interesting thing in my life at that moment. It isn't that I want to zone out it just constantly happens.

10mg of Adderall XR once a day changed my fucking life. I actually can pay attention throughout whole lectures, I can do my work in the same time as my peers, I can actually finish my tests on time. I don't lose or forget shit anymore. It's 8/8. Moral of the story, extremely hard work can mask the signs.

**TL;DR**: Trouble focusing all my life, worked super hard to live up to expectations, reached a point where hard work wasn't enough to overcome it. One emotional break down later, went to the doctor, got diagnosed. It changed my life.","cxva43k",3,1449840087,"2015-12-11 13:21:27"

Most people will get restless for a few minutes, wake up briefly, or get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and go back to bed. You probably hit this mark and are finished sleeping, so going back to bed will only wake you in the middle of a cycle, making you tired.","e3b74cf",1,1532982280,"2018-07-30 20:24:40"

"8807","I generally agree, but it is also my understanding that young children are still going through a lot of neurodeveloping in their early years. And it takes a quick google search to see lots of places do mention environmental factors as being possible causes (but not enough research has been done).

From the mayo clinic:

 ""

To help reduce your child's risk of ADHD:

* **During pregnancy,** avoid anything that could harm fetal development. For example, don't drink alcohol, use recreational drugs or smoke cigarettes.
* **Protect your child from exposure to pollutants and toxins,** including cigarette smoke and lead paint.
* **Limit screen time.** Although still unproved, it may be prudent for children to avoid excessive exposure to TV and video games in the first five years of life.

""

So no, one does not suddenly get adhd, its developed. But kids are still developing their brains at young ages, so maybe they're already at a higher risk because of how their brain developed in the womb, but screen time might still be part of the cause of actually developing adhd as a child. But more research clearly needs to be done on that front. Or, maybe, as you said, it just exacerbates the issues. But exacerbating issues could mean the difference in symptoms that are worse enough to affect daily life and lead to a diagnosis, and symptoms that are mild and don't affect your daily life that much. 

I agree with you that electronics aren't inherently bad, just depends on how you use them. But it does seem very important to be even more careful with young children whose brains are still developing.","g4s0312",1,1599786485,"2020-09-11 01:08:05"

So to get moving, when you have this impulse to work on a goal or do something you know you need to do, you count down ""5-4-3-2-1 Go"" and *move* acting on that goal. A woman named Mel Robbins recently wrote a whole book on this and has several [talks online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp7E973zozc&amp;t=838s) about it. 

If you are not sure about the goals, a good place to start is the list of things you wrote in your post of what you know you should do, and what would help. Such as talking to a psychiatrist who can help you work with ADHD, OCD, Aniexty, etc. Going back to college. Being financially independent of your parents. Fixing and maintaining your business.

I really don't think the strict 3-hour frame is a consistant thing .I ended up overlapping doses TOO many times and you'd that it's even worst when you have an empty stomach .
It took me months to find a solution to this but I ended up just letting the meds do their thing until I notice the ""I'm starting to lose focus"" signs . I usually drink water/eat sugary things to see if it's really time to take my medicine or just the signs of dehydrarion and low blood sugar . Drinking Coke is good too for giving a kick in between doses but again it's kind of (weak) stimulant that can overlap with your meds if you drink too much (Overlapping doses + 1/2 liter of Coke I've been there!)

Why is taking your meds in class not an option? You can have lunch during your break and your meds a little later during the class if you feel like the 1st dose is still working . 
I really think that you should take and adjust your meds when you need them and not stick to a strict schedule .

if you have free view tv you don't have alot  of options what you watch ans ita usually repeats . Tv can quickly become very boring very reptitive and it comes down to what is being broadcasted I mean what would you say dumb people are watching all day a 24 hr man vs food a thon lol tv is to waste time  youl learn a few things But unless your actually implementing thks to your own life what's the point.

Besides that  the tempo and shifts of concentration from relentless ads shifting your focus to states where the mind is completely uninterested I wonder does it become a habit with some people that the slightest hint of irrelevance they disengage 

And the internet , studies have shown people are  adapting to scan read instead of properly digesting, because the internet is bunged with nonsense and you can end up not even getting an answer and the internet isn't a truly reliable source anyway. Obviously I depends on what you are researching. 

I'm not saying you cannot learn from both absolutley you can and they are both great tools but I  find you can easily become lost within it  spend hours not being  mindful  and wasting time.

 we need to disengage but an habitual disengagement alongside being at the whim of ""what of is being broadcasted"" you are subjected to a duration of distraction  and complete waste of time . You will likely  not use anything you have watched anyway it is a waste of time really.

That is just my opinion

Caffeine itself is a stimulant which will explain why some people feel their day cannot begin until after a few cups of coffee. Others don't do well with this combo, myself included.

-Ritalin does better when taken with food, most find that it helps with the nausea they tend to feel when on an empty stomach. Most prescribers tend to stress that it be taken with or right after a meal and encourage hydration+snacking during the day as it may affect appetite.

-Some prescribers suggest not going taking a ""med holiday"". Some people don't do well with the difference of how they feel ""off"" their meds vs ""on"". But that usually is best discussed with your doctor.

I suggest talking with your doctor, while Ritalin is one of the first line medications for ADHD, it is not the only effective medication. Some people swear by Vyvanse, others Straterra and then there's Intuiv. Ultimately, your doctor has to work with you to find the best match that works for you and that helps you live your best life.

My son was in Adderall and it was not a good match, his mood swings became unmanageable. Through feedback from his teachers and a conversation with his pediatrician, we switched to Ritalin and the difference was like night and day.

I hope this helps.

Edit:
For sleep have you tried Melatonin? 1-3mg in the evening may be helpful. Again let your doc know if you decide to take it.

Honestly Ritalin does not make everything ok. It only opens the door, if you have social anxiety it will not take it away. Therapy sessions may help give you tools to help with the anxiety?","dm8fdq4",3,1503927853,"2017-08-28 13:44:13"

"8887","Yup.  Almost everything about the American system is about corporations and banks making a profit.  If the government gave financial aid to all lower and middle income citizens so that they can graduate in 4 years and not have to get into debt, then the banks who rely on making a profit off of student loans would get pissed and lobby like crazy.  And, unlike all other forms of debt, you can never declare bankruptcy to escape student loans.  

I work with a woman who dropped out of college because she had to take care of her two daughters by herself, since her abusive boyfriend ended up going to prison.  She is still paying off those student loans over two decades later and will continue to pay them off for the rest of her life.  They automatically take out a certain percentage of her paycheck for the student loans, so she can barely make ends meet.  

Now, who benefits from this situation other than the bank that loaned her the money in the first place and the corporations that now have employees who are too scared to look for other jobs for fear of not being able to make payments on their loans?  That's something that often gets ignored by the media.  Even if I graduate and get a job, I'm pretty much going to avoid taking any risks like starting my own business or moving to another city, since if it doesn't work out then my student loans won't get paid and will just keep increasing.

We Americans would be better off if she was able to go back to school and finish her degree so that she can earn a higher wage and pay more in taxes.  Her children would be better off since they would be able to live in better neighborhoods and get a better start in their education so that they too can graduate from college.  But, of course she can't go back to school since she has to continue making payments on her student loans, which means that she has to work a low wage job for the rest of her life. 

Unsurprisingly, one of her daughters never went to college and now works a low wage job, while the other one has taken out student loans to pay for her college, which she is still attending.

One of the hardest parts of my life has been the guilt that I get when I have leisure time and I spend it not being ""productive"". 

I kind of realized that I don't really need to be productive every second of my life and there is no shame in fucking around and wasting time as long as I don't do it all the time or at times when I shouldn't be. 

I read somewhere that in order to be fulfilled you need to divide your leisure time into three categories:

- activities that challenge you (you know these will improve yourself)

- activities that you love (anything that gives you pleasure, it doesn't have to be productive)

- activities that give back to others (seeing your friends, volunteering)

Anyways, the point I'm trying to make is that you aren't obligated to always be improving yourself. Sometimes improving yourself means relaxing for a bit and giving yourself permission to enjoy shitposts guilt-free.","d4riqx1",2,1467138645,"2016-06-28 18:30:45"

I perform better with some time pressure on me: it’s like playing Beat the Clock. And at the end of the fifteen minutes I have to walk away. It really helps me use my time more effectively.

I think my handwriting has only gotten better in adulthood, but I take a lot of notes for school (bad memory) so I think it just happened over time. If you're committed to handwriting but think your notes are too messy, they have smart notebooks where you write with a stylus, and then it converts your writing to typed up text for future reference. Typing notes is always helpful, and speech-to-text software is helpful too if your hands are fidgety.

"8916","That’s an interesting explanation.  So kids were more impulsive before and now that is no longer the norm.  Thats one trait but there are so many others...  I strongly believe that kids are more stressed because of lack of proper education.  Schools do not teach kids well nor prepare them for the next step. Stress causes anxiety and lack of focus. Life is more expensive and I think parents are forced to both work leaving kids to daycares / preschools that will not nurture them nor prepare them for school.  Schools force little kids to sit still for hours not because of “rigorous education” but because it’s difficult for teachers to be creative enough to deal with 30kids unless they all sit straight through.  I think this freaking society is making kids gain all sorts of issues then to take them to doctors making those docs and pharmaceuticals rich.  I wish someone with money and power and compassion for kids would step in to conduct this research.

I've met young people who I think are just too afraid of student loans at all. With finding jobs out of college so competitive these days, a high GPA might pay for itself if you can quit the job and devote yourself to school. For some reason, employers and post-grad programs don't seem to count having held a job with a 3.0 GPA as good as having had no job and getting a 3.6+, even though I'd argue the former is far more difficult and indicative of talent and dedication.

"8932","While both my parents were accepting of my ADHD, my dad still held me to a very high standard with (from my perspective) not much leeway to account for my ADHD. For a long time my understanding of ADHD was limited to a vague ""it's hard for me to concentrate"". I didn't really start to gain a deeper understanding of all the facets of ADHD until college, so prior to that time I attributed a lot of my ADHD-influenced shortcomings to ""not applying myself"" and ""not caring enough"" and ""just not thinking"". 

I agree that conditioning stays, and I think that's why I still have a hard time cutting myself some slack. I'll hold myself to a standard that I \_know\_ is unreasonable to hold someone else to, yet I'll still try and then beat myself up when I inevitably fail to meet it. I'm trying to not do that, and I think I've gotten better than I was, but it's still a challenge, and some days I win, some days I lose.

I actually tend to not take my meds every so often (on days where I can afford to crash-and-burn responsibilities-wise) just to remind myself of how much of an effect they have. Sometimes I'll feel guilty at the end of such days for not accomplishing even a quarter of what I wanted to, but I think it also helps convince me a bit more that I \_really do\_ have ADHD, so the guilt might be worth it.

"8934","There are things that are going to be boring, thats for sure. 

This is going to be a long explanation. 

Here we go, our brain work in a certain way and everyone is different especially the ADD brain. Everyone has this, its called the Default Mode Network (DMN), and what it is basically in the shortest detail, its the way we tap into when we are bored. So when you are drifting off during middle of class and day dream, thats what your brain is doing, tapping into the DMN. Everyone does this, but the ADD brain does it more frequent, hence the explanation why we can't focus on somethings. The hyperactivity of the ADD, before called ADHD is the part where we hyper focus on somethings. That maybe from being annoying to only focusing on the things you like, because thats what hyper focusing is.. The explanation of the tapping into DMN and ADD, correlates strongly because we can hyper focus on being in la-la land. 

Now for some neuro-chemistry. Our brain has receptors which accepts certain molecules. Our neuropathway has neurons and end of those neurons have receptors. When you feel ""happy,"" the brain releases flux of dopamine. When you need to focus, brain releases (or more production of) norepinephrine. The different parts of the brain correlates with each other to function properly. Such as the frontal lobe storing short term memory, then to a different part of the brain. The front brain is where it's most likely to receive the norepinephrine first. Then the cascade of norepinephrine (more production of) production happens different parts of the brain where it needs it. Here is the the part ADD brains wonders off. The brain receives the norepinephrine, right? ADD brains has less of it, simple right? Thats why the psycho stimulating drugs such as, Ritalin and Adderall inhibits (stops) the dissolving of the chemical. Don't worry dopamine and norepinephrine will dissolve, because they don't last forever and the drugs will digest short period of time, with limited half-life. So with help of drugs such as these will help ""focus"" towards learning. Hence the reason why so many people abuse them.

The effects of the psycho-simulating drugs can cause great effects towards the ADD brain, and reason why people try to find the balance in quality of life. Here is a big, huge, enormous warning though, the brain will have negative effects on these psycho-simulating drugs if not taking in the proper dosage range. A study has been done where they tested children with ADD brain vs non-ADD brain. The study showed that the ADD and non-ADD brains have improved academically, then they gave them more to find out if improvements increases. Nope, the more they took less proficient academically showed toward the non-ADD brains. 

So in all, when your searching for hobbies don't let things try to bother you because you can't keep track of them, because in some ways our brain will automatically places the priority of importance. Such as placing the keys are more important then where you put the wallet, something like that. All brains does this to become efficient and balancing importance. I don't know your priorities are, and this just an example. 

If you need to find organization, I suggest to write down priorities and list them from importance and figure out the amount of time it will take (realistically and this could mean that you have to figure out how long A will take, and when you have enough time for B then C, etc...). This will help you adapt to your situation.

The situation I will refer to as genetics on top of genetics, called epigenetic. There are strong studies showing that the ADD parents will produce offsprings with ADD, so strong correlation with actual genetics. But some individuals have developed ADD even though family tree shows that the parents or past generation never had ADD or symptoms of ADD. How does this explain actual genetics? Well, people adapt towards situations, so here should be a vague, super vague example: Kid had a good life, but all of a sudden the parents divorce and results in decrease in wealth and less time with parents. The kid will make ""imaginary"" friends and day dream to fill the gap of the once caring life he had before. So he keeps tapping into DMN and resulting in less production of norepinephrine and other chemicals in the brain for focusing function. The brain will adapt towards this behavior and the kid academics drops. So, this explains ADD can be developed in this scenario and this all made up for explanation. 

The point of me explaining epigenetics is, you can adapt towards your situation by developing the habit of organization. I don't know if this will change you but, as you keep organizing your life, you will find that you become ""less"" hyper focus on things. Magically the brain produce more norepinephrine on its own because you need that production for organizing and production of things that need to get done. 

With this explained, you should have a good idea of the symptoms, reasons, and development of ADD. 

Reason why I explain this is because I want you to understand about yourself and you, yourself can identify your own faults and fix them in a way that will bring quality of life. 

TL:TR: Start organizing and take the recommended dosage amount of prescribed medication.

"8948","I feel that to my core. 

We have such an urge to learn and do good, almost a craving for it, but our brains are constantly working against us. I was reading a book, and apparently ADHD affects our frontal lobe, the part of the brain right behind our foreheads. ADHD means that our frontal lobe never fully developed. In the frontal lobe is where our impulse control is, memory, attention span, social interactions, etc. A lot of us have the frontal lobe of a child, which explains the temper tantrums, the need for things immediately, bad time management.

I felt the same way when I first took adderall. I felt like I awakened a sage mode or something, I could see better, hear better, learn better etc lol. It still helps me at a pretty low dose.

But I keep hearing so many good things about Vyvanse. I may have to consider that, as Vyvanse tends to be a more extended release, and Adderall is like a quick boost, but even taking it twice a day, it doesn't always last all day.

Try to do your most complicated tasks within the first 4-6 hours of your dose.

This way when my brain is ready to focus if only for a split second, I'll already have the assignment up.

Think about it- there are less distractions in the lesson, you get to follow along at your own pace. You can actually work for five minutes, check out for a while, and come right back to what you were doing without missing anything. I've had a lot of success with online classes- I've made A's in all of them. 

Honestly, the key is rigid organization- I write out a to-do list with tasks such as read module 1, take notes, complete assignment 1, read p.1-13, etc. Then out beside those tasks, I put the due date in parentheses. Whenever it comes to assignments, I often will take the time to create a draft once I know the requirements- because I break an assignment down into simpler tasks with the draft, I'm able to periodically do 5-10 minutes of work at a time without creating a mess of a paper.  

As for remembering to log on, put the site on your bookmarks bar. My first three or so bookmarks are sites I need to visit every day- before I start browsing anything else, I open those three sites and do what I need to do.

"9006","I was diagnosed last month, and it was very straightforward. You need to see a psych who specialises in ADHD, not any random psych. I was also super afraid of being treated like I just want drugs. But they were great about it. I was upfront with them about historical recreational drugs use too. They're used to people with ADHD self-medicating, so it wasn't an issue. I think you should get yourself on the waitlist for an ADHD psych ASAP.

Alternatively, if you're in Melbourne, I recommend One Point Medical. You get screened by a GP who's an expert in ADHD first, and then they recommend you to their psych. Since the psych knows you've already been screened and found likely to have ADHD, you're not on the huge long waitlist, they fast-track you. The psych's job is then to rule out other similar things that could be causing the symptoms (eg borderline personality disorder, complex PTSD, etc etc). (It's not bulk-billed, so even after medicare rebate, the GP appointment costs $150 and the psych appointment costs $400, which is pretty painful.)

There may be GP-based options in other states as well, I found One Point just by googling.

(FYI since I also fell foul of reading too much US-based info - you can't get Adderall in Australia or many of the other meds you hear talked about on this sub. We have short-acting dex, vyvanse (long-acting dex), ritalin, long-acting ritalin, and that's it. The long-acting forms are not covered by medicare, so they're a lot more expensive (like $100-200 a month instead of $27).","ebwm9in",1,1544962097,"2018-12-16 12:08:17"

You stated that you’re competent and relatively talented in your field, but you’re “terrible at masking”....

I think it’s understandable that you’re terrible at masking.  I think anyone would be terrible at being something that they are not... in this case, you’re trying to be a neurotypical person when you’re not.  I spent many years doing the same thing only to find myself hopping around from job to job.

 Hiding your ADHD makes you vulnerable at work because you’ll be expected to work like a normal person, which you aren’t.  When you find your next gig (and YOU WILL!), embrace your ADHD.  

After you land your next job, as for a 1 on 1 meeting with your new manager and tell this person about ADHD and how it affects you.  By doing this, you help your boss become a more effective manager and you can make having ADHD your armor instead of your burden.  You can’t expect a neurotypical person to understand the struggles with ADHD, but by being open to your manager and asking for help from time to time when it comes to prioritizing tasks or creating smaller milestones for big projects... you will get more out of your job and your team can create a strategy to capitalize on your strengths and mitigate the risks that comes with our weaknesses.  

If they never know you have ADHD, everyone (including you) is put at a disadvantage because you become a resource that’s not properly utilized.

This has been my experience and it’s completely changed my relationship with my employer.  I understand that my situation won’t be like everyone else’s, but at the end of the day, you have to be true to yourself.  Don’t be a fish trying to climb a tree... otherwise, you’ll always fail.  &lt;3","ge4uk0z",1,1606728401,"2020-11-30 09:26:41"

"9016","That's odd! I'm taking Zoloft with my Vyvanse and I've never done better in my whole life. 


I took Celexa and Wellbutrin for a few years when I was a teenager and absolutely hated it. The psychiatrists at Kaiser Permanente wouldn't prescribe me anything but that combo and it made me so miserable. 


Fast forward a few years later and I was taking Adderall XR and Buspar but the Buspar made feel too mellow and complacent so I went to another specialist and after trial and error we made our way to Vyvanse since it was gentler that Adderall for people with anxiety and because I didn't respond well to Concerta. After finding a stable stimulant treatment we just added in Zoloft, which I was reluctant to take because of my bad experiences with Celexa, Prozac, and Wellbutrin, but this combo is the best.


I have no idea why you're being told that you can't take an antidepressant or SSRI with Adderall, because Vyvanse isn't that much different and in addition to that I've got a friend that is being treated with a low dose of Adderall XR and Paxil and it does wonders for her. 


I feel your pain, though, because that is similar to what I dealt with when I had Kaiser insurance. One doctor had listed me as Asperger's, one added Depression to my chart, and another added Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety and then every psychiatrist refused to treat my ADHD. The weirdest part though was that every single doctor I saw through Kaiser kept trying to prescribe me the same thing: Celexa, Wellbutrin, a combination of the two, or Prozac. One doctor tried telling me that I couldn't have stimulant medication because I am asthmatic and another tried telling me that they couldn't prescribe it to me because they wanted to treat my anxiety, depression, and Asperger's. 


You might try finding a psychiatrist that specializes in ADHD and/or depression. My current one has a lot of experience with anxiety, depression, ADHD, and it was a huge change interacting with her versus the rest of the psychiatrists I've ever seen. You may even search for a psychiatrist that works with teenagers a lot, since they often seem to be good at working with ADHD and the such.

"9071","Have you ever heard of Sensory Processing Disorder? I have it, and what you're describing sounds terribly similar to my experiences.

People with SPD can be largely one of two types, or a mix of both: hypersensitive and hyposensitive. The hyper type is overly sensitive to sensory stimulation. Auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory cues are amplified to the point of discomfort or even pain. Hyposensitive types may struggle to interpret sensory input; their perception might be slowed or lessened or both, among other things.

Your sensory issues could also be a product of your anxiety. Really anxious people sometimes report feeling overwhelmed by their surroundings, not necessarily just during panic attacks.

I think they key difference is that anxiety disorders can lead to moments of sensory overload, but SPD causes near-constant sensory overload throughout one's entire life. Sounds like you've dealt with it all your life. Might want to ask your doctor about it or try to get tested someplace.","es4qot9",1,1561591368,"2019-06-26 23:22:48"

"9077","So I started meds recently, and luckily my headaches disappeared after the first few weeks, even when I increased the dose, but in those weeks here are some things that really helped! 
- a proper amount of sleep, you mention that being a source of headaches for you. Have you considered melatonin to help regulate your sleeping hours? Adhd reduces production of it and it's changed my life, maybe mention it to your therapist!
- screen time. It's really hard this year, depending on what you do in life it's worse, but not looking at screens would help a lot. Blue light glasses might be a solution here, they worked for me! You can find them for about 20 bucks online, and if you look for ones with good reviews they genuinely make a difference. In the meantime try reducing blue light/activating night shift on your devices!
- a cup of coffee helped when the headache arrived (not decaf, it's the caffeine that helps)
- sugar, eating something sweet can also help
- fresh air away from all screens and music, I'd go on a walk for half an hour without my headphones (I know, I thought I'd go crazy but the lack of stimulation is actually important here) or looking at my phone throughout and I usually felt my head was a lot light after 
- as a lot of others have said... change your meds if it's ruining your life, meds should make life easier, not worse

Yes, I can. Sometimes it helps with concentration. Sometimes it has the same effect as on you (i.e. I focus on people talking instead of my actual task). 

It is the same with music. Sometimes it helps me to concentrate. Sometimes it gets super distracting, and I need silence.

"9091","I didn't have any unusual childhood trauma and I am extremely, dysfunctionally avoidant.   


Basically if you have ADHD you have a history of stressful situations: being in trouble with other people, screwing things up, being in a position where you don't know what to do. You develop anxiety reactions. Your system floods with cortisol, the stress response hormone. This is basically what it means to be triggered.   


It's like an overly sensitive alarm system. After enough stress, the alarm system just starts going off all the time. Every time you encounter a reminder of a situation that was really stressful in the past, your nervous system goes HERE WE GO AGAIN. TIME TO PANIC and dumps the exact same chemicals into your bloodstream it uses to warn you of impending death.  


And this is more conjectural on my part, but it seems like after that alarm goes off unnecessarily 800,000 times, some other part of your brain starts to turn it off after two beeps. It does this by refusing to let you think about or engage with whatever set the alarm off. You develop this quick, instinctual avoidance of certain kinds of thoughts in which your mind just leaps to something else.   


All of this is dysfunctional to some degree.   


I think it develops roughly the same way for any mental disorder that involves anxiety and memory.","es47qx6",1,1561578886,"2019-06-26 19:54:46"

"9096","Seriously, this is probably one of the most relatable posts I've ever read in this sub.. this is exactly how I've always been, and it has definitely been a struggle.

Realizing and (correctly) identifying this pattern in ourselves is the hardest part and it really seems like you're doing really well at that -- it took me 10 years to figure out that my initial obsessions were not, in fact, all love. I spent my entire 20s falling in and out of that initial infatuation with people, feeling heartbroken, shifting my priorities around and letting other goals fall to the wayside so I could chase those dopamine hits. 

After being diagnosed and medicated for almost 2 years now, I pretty much see this as one of the bad habits I'll always be managing. It has gotten a lot easier as I have gotten older, luckily!

I really had to learn that it didn't make my emotions any less valid if I refused to let them dictate my life and my choices. I had to learn how to give myself room to be sad WITHOUT letting it affect my life in a negative way. Being mindful of this was the biggest piece of the puzzle for me.

I actually spent a lot of time basically making pros and cons lists -- for example, when I'm sad, I am much more likely to daydream the day away at work and end up feeling shitty. At the same time, I'm usually very motivated to paint or work on art when I'm feeling down. Daydreaming at work makes me feel shittier and the cycle continues, but spending some time in my art studio helps lift me out. Refusing to give the negative any space in my life leaves me with more room for the positive.

But most of all, go easy on yourself and keep your chin up! It's normal to have crushes on people and you deserve to enjoy the highs as well as experiencing the lows. Just don't let your emotions run your life -- remember that even if you can't change how you feel, you can still work on how you act.

I don't know if this is true for everyone but for me, at least, it just gets easier with time. If you do anything enough times in a row, you'll get better at it.

My girlfriend and I just celebrated our three year anniversary last month, and if someone had told me five years ago that this would be my life now, I would never have believed them. 

**TL;DR -- Go easy on yourself, but be honest with yourself. Identify your feelings of obsession and the good and bad habits that go along with them. Try and cultivate the GOOD habits, and hopefully that will leave less room for the bad habits to mess with your life and your psyche. It's possible to get a handle on this habit, and it gets easier with time -- just like any other habit that we have like exercising or budgeting or time management. You already are on the right track so just keep being mindful and honest with yourself.**","e3ykxlh",3,1533921097,"2018-08-10 17:11:37"

With starting college and work, I don't think missing 1-2 days of either every other week is going to be a good idea.

"9120","You just have to find what you’re good at and let it ride. I understand how you feel 1000 times over. As a kid, my school thought that I was severely autistic. A very extensive IQ test was administered over an 8 hour period around the age of 9-11. Not that it matters, but my IQ was “measured” at 130, but it was noted that my true IQ is likely 138-141 (I think). The outside psychologist determined many things that were far from what the school psychologist “determined.” I had far above average verbal/reasoning skills when compared to peers of my age (above 12th grade level). My reading comprehension was at a 9-10th grade level and all other skills were either slightly above or at the grade/age bracket. The main problem was that I needed more time because my brain processes information faster in certain areas than it can verbalize or remember at times. 

Basically, just find what you’re really good at and keep trying. I found out two years ago that I’m actually really fantastic with mechanical issues. I can fully work on a car from front to back and I had never done it before age 24. There’s a small catch though. I can explain it to myself in my head when I’m working on it, but as soon as someone else comes around the knowledge is gone and I babble like a doofus.

"9136","I was very lucky to find a psychiatrist who was of the opinion ADHD is too often indirectly treated via the wrong meds. 

Since 2003, I've been on a combination of Concerta and Ambien, later ativan for anxiety.

My dependence on Ambien was worrisome to me (not addiction, the fact that I can't sleep without it specifically) and I've since very recently switched to klonopin for both.

Now I take Concerta in the morning and klonopin at night. I can go without them, but it's harder (and pointless). I also have DSPS and they are basically all interlinked- I have DSPD insomnia which is part of ADHD. Anxiety is of course part of the package.

ANYWAY my point is that they're treatable, but the sucky part is all our drugs are ones people use for fun. So it's hard to get a regimen that isn't getting SSRIs passed off on you when stimulants are really the only effective tx for ADHD symptoms.

Non-pharmaceutically, kratom and kava are both helpful for anxiety, I find. My cousin had to quit smoking trees to find a new job, and I gave her some kratom and it's helping her a lot.

But yes, basically we have this dysfunctional brain lobe that needs to be told when to be alert, when to go to fucking sleep, and not to be processing everything all the time :) That combination has enabled me to join the adult world. 

I resist SSRIs because I don't have mood lability and I don't want that to change. I'm happy as balls, I just get *anxious*. Bad, too.

ETA: I like very much that the klonopin does the job the ambien and ativan did, and moreso that my dermatophagia has reduced by about 80% in two weeks. ","cy7btey",2,1450751522,"2015-12-22 02:32:02"

"9160","**A** ) We can't diagnose you

You could very much be ADHD, we can't tell if you are or not.  All your symptoms look like ADHD but other disorders can look like ADHD and we can't diagnose you over the internet.

A trained psych who knows what ADHD is and has been following ADHD research and diagnosis of the last 20 years is the best way to determine if its ADHD or some other condition.

**B** ) It could be ADHD but see **A**

That said your condition very much could be ADHD.  In fact it matches several stereotypes of a specific unofficial subtypes of ADHD+ a certain collections of comorbidity (things related to anxiety and such)

There are many types of ADHD they are not all the same.  One brother may be a hyperactive, extroverted, impulsive kid.  His blood brother may be the quiet, shy inattentive type, with neuroticism and is extremely precise.  Both brothers will share the vast majority of the genes but how these genes activate (epigenetic effects aka environment+genetics),  prenatal development in your mother womb and the first few years of life, and environmental traumas can change how your ADHD may manifest.  Furthermore things like your age and your personality also effect this.  Children are more likely to be hyperactive, but as adults they may not be hyperactive but internally restless, and always have their mind racing or daydreaming and never stopping.

And some ADHD people are never hyperactive.

&amp;nbsp;

**C)** Many types of ADHD meds that work differently, many types of ADHD for there are many genes and other causes that cause ADHD and thus one person ADHD is not like another ADHD and thus different meds for different people.

We have 6 different types of mainstream ADHD medications that work completely differently.  Two of the types of medications are stimulants, 4+ are non stimulants.  The stimulant Adderall an amphetamine works different than the stimulant Methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin, Focalin)

Only about 2/3rds of ADHD people have their ADHD treated by Adderall.  The rest either have too severe of side effects or they just do not benefit.  If you try both stimulants (Amphetamine and Methylphenidate) the number rises to about 8 in 10 depending on the study benefit from 1 or the other medicine or both.  If you try the non stimulants the number is **roughly** about 92%, with about **roughly** half of that 8% just have too severe of side effects for any medication (remember we have 6 types of mainstream medications) and the other half just do not benefit on a cost benefit ratio (some improvement but not enough to justify the cost or side effects of medication).

Finding the right med is trial and error, in most people that are ADHD the degree of improvement greatly outweighs the side effects, and in most ADHD people the side effects are minor such as decreased appetite. (Bigger problem with kids though)

&amp;nbsp;

And we have no clue if that dose was right for you.  Too low of dose will not treat ADHD.  Too high of dose will cause emotional side effects such as anxiety, emotional flattening (you feel kinda zoned out emotionally like a zombie), or hyperfocus where you can focus but your mind loses its flexibility.

Finding the right med is trial and error, this is why you should be with a doctor instead of self experimentation for first they can speed up finding the right med to treat your life problems, second they know far more about this than you and they can help you get the best results, third while these meds are generally safe they know about the side effects and they can do tests whether you should or should not be on such a med.

For example did you due an EKG?  Do you know if you have a minor heart defect which in daily life will not cause a problem...until you go on a stimulant and now have a serious health risk.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this helps and I hope you get help for whatever is causing your issues, it very could be ADHD or something else.","cporc06",2,1427168847,"2015-03-24 03:47:27"

"9173","I apologize for the rambling response as I tried to think through this:

Looking back on it, I can see I used anger as a way to do several things. I guess it gave me a dopamine hit and helped me get over the my trouble getting started or keeping at things. For example, I wrote a novel over a couple year period but found I had to whip myself into a state of anger to write it. I told myself that it was having to get into my character's head, but I realize now it was just how I motivated myself to write. I needed to be angry to walk away from my family and sit at my desk. And man, it was exhausting.

I also found that some confrontations just get me interested and excited. Not random lashing out, but getting worked up and confrontational. It kind of gave me a bit of a high. I am really not an a-hole. But I would catch myself in situations where I had a reasonable grievance and letting it get bigger because somehow or other it felt good. For example, at a soccer game, a parent for the other team cheered when my son apparently got injured. I had no problem calling him out, dressing him down in front of his fellow parents and pointing out that not one of them was defending him because they new he was wrong. The guy got up and left. I knew nothing was going to happen - I can spot an arm chair tough guy at a thousand yards. Was I justified? A bit. I certainly wasn't wrong. But here's the thing: I now realize that I did it because I enjoyed it and that it gave me focus. (Seriously, I am a nice guy - I'm talking about something that would happen once in awhile, not constantly, and that I know have some understanding of.)  

Other times I would feel impatience well up - annoyance with traffic, people on the train, pointless crap.  While the anger was real, i indulged in it internally.

I guess what I'm working towards is that **I used anger to self-medicate much in the same way I used caffeine** \- treating a problem I was aware of but had not defined. I'm in my 50s and assume I'm older than you. Maybe that's why I could put weird parameters around my anger and use it somehow. When I was younger, it was more despairing. I didn't act it out, but it crushed me. I used to say flippantly that at least I know my anger is my own. It didn't give me any control over anything (and I never acted out) but it helped me temporarily overcome my inner confusion. 

So, if you stayed with me through this ramble, ask yourself: **is your anger serving some purpose**?  Is it your way of asserting control or whipping up your emotions to just get yourself engaged? For me, that was the connection to my ADHD and I realized it was a way to manage and motivate me - at a great emotional cost. And that sort of anger was one of the first major improvements medication brought me. I just feel better and don't need the self-medicating of using anger. (As for my other self-medicating tool, my caffeine consumption, once my defining characteristic in the eyes of some people, has dwindled to almost nothing.)  Maybe if you can see it in the context of your ADHD, something that may arise from it but something you unconsciously use in some way, maybe you can find away to mitigate it.

You are the one with adhd now. The lesser one the grown-ups have to look out for.

I cannot advice you on what to do.. but I can tell you what I would do:

I would look for a good job. Pray that I land in a good team with a chill vibe.

When asked by your current company why you are leaving I would say ""Because my supervisor does anything she can to make my life miserable and HR did nothing to stop the mobbing, nor did they believe me. Instead I had to listen to them blaming me for the problems.""

Then I would visit your countries equivalent of kununu (a website were you can rate your ex-employer. People looking for a job often check that) and write a lenghty report about the situation, your supervisor (you can even mention her name, or write S. M. instead of ""Sara Madison"".. you know) and **how badly** the HR handled this model case of mobbing. Victim blaming in 2020... Really?

This is for getting my sweet revenge, for warning future applicants (there could be people like us applying) and to help the company change (for many it has to hurt.. otherwise they'll never change).

Then I would not mention my adhd at the next workplace, as I want to be taken seriously.. and the chance that HR has an actual understanding of adhd is slim.

Depending on the region/country people use the word depression in a casual way pretty much just like sadness. That's why I started saying 'clinical depression'. Meaning clinically relevant, thus depression to a degree that it impairs your functioning. But I'm not an expert.

But it really works for pretty much all mental illnesses. Like OCD for example. Everyone is not sure if they locked the door and have to check again or something like that.

Or anxiety. Anxiety is a totally normal emotion. Every human being is anxious at times, and it was evolutionary totally essential for our existence.
But 'clinical anxiety' (or 'generalized anxiety disorder') is when your anxiety is that prominent that it affects your functioning. And other people having anxiety too, does not invalidate that at all.","fdqqaib",1,1578672577,"2020-01-10 16:09:37"

With that said, it's hard to find the correct dosage. However my GP doctor is having my DNA tested ($250) so she can identify what will work best, time release, etc. This may be an option to help him with the best possible results.

"9216","It sounds like you took way too much Adderall. Why on earth would your doctor start with the max dose? Granted, I was diagnosed later in life and haven't been on medicine enough to build a tolerance because I couldn't afford insurance for a while, but I can't even imagine taking a 60mg dose. That sounds torturous.

Ritalin put me in a daze, I couldn't focus at all. I felt like some kind of mindless zombie who could just lay on the couch and do nothing. This was at 10mg. Adderall at 10 mg helped me focus, but put me in a little bit of a mental fog. My therapist said I was on a low dose, so I cut one of my pills in half and took 15mg, which made me feel as bad as the Ritalin. It completely obliterated my appetite and sapped all of my energy. The symptoms you described sound similar to when I took the extra Adderall and it was miserable. The next day I tried taking the remaining half pill by itself and realized 5mg was my sweet spot. I felt alert, I felt like me, but I was calm and my thoughts were no longer constantly racing. I no longer cared if a slow person was driving in front of me on the road. My appetite was lower than usual, but not to the point that I couldn't enjoy a meal (as an overweight, impulsive eater, I consider it a perk that the edge is taken off of my usually insatiable appetite). Now when it wears off, my appetite is pretty ravenous for a bit and it also makes me thirsty. For a little while I was on Adderall xr and I think that was 10mg, and it felt the same as 5mg of IR, but the medicine lasted much longer of course before the crash came.","d7h0g4k",1,1473521290,"2016-09-10 15:28:10"

"9218","""Hyperfocus"" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD.

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

Haven't had a single anxiety attack since then, and general anxiety is drastically lower too as I've worked on other self-esteem issues that accompany Codependency.

It can cause suicidal thoughts, overwhelming emotional meltdowns, panic attacks, you name it. In less severe cases, it can just cause some really unwarranted overreaction and aggressive behavior on the part of the ADHD person.

"9273","I have a language/speech disorder that was more obvious than my adhd as a young kid. Mine is expressive. I didn’t start talking until I was five, and when I did start talking, no one understood what I saying. In fact, I can still REMEMBER having no idea how people knew the difference between the words “wife” and “white” and “grass” and “glass”. Like, I inherently knew the meanings were different, but it’s like I couldn’t hear “glass” as a word alone and automatically know if someone meant “glass” or “grass”. 

I spent a few years in speech therapy... I only really remember practicing certain sounds, like R’s. As I got older, it would frequently happen where I would say something totally loud and clear, and the person talking to me would ask, “did you just words?” adamantly suggest that I just made a random string of sounds. People also love to suggest I am on drugs because I appear to be spacey sometimes -  even though I’m not. 

Never had a terrible stutter and it’s gotten a lot better in the past few years. But I would occasionally get stuck on a word three or four times before finishing a sentence. 

All of these are relatively minor and the adults in my life never made it seem like it was something to address. I just sort of dealt with people giggling every now and then. Maybe people who knew me were just used to it.

BUT nothing has caused me more anxiety about speaking in a professional setting than my inability to recall specific words or common phrases! I mean, it’s like my mind goes into a black hole in the middle of a sentence! It’s totally random, but all of the sudden the word I wanted to use just isn’t there - like stupid words that everyone knows and uses. There are some words that it happens with more than others, but nothing is off limits! I’ll think of every word that sounds like it, but not the word. Beyond that, I have an extremely hard time getting my point across to people when I’m speaking. I’ve pretty much resorted to finishing my thoughts with “does that make sense?” Because it usually doesn’t. I feel like I need to carry around a picture book for people to understand me. 

So that, and common phrases like, “ruffle my feathers” or something stupid like that. I really like to mix those fun phrases up and say just the weirdest things and have no idea that it’s wrong. You don’t want to know how long I said “I don’t mean to fluff my feathers” to mean “brag” before I realized I was mixing up “I don’t mean to brag” with “I don’t want to ruffle any feathers”


Wow. I have never said or written that all out together before. But there’s some speech stuff that been linked to comorbidity with adhd. I was diagnosed with adhd after college.","f1l4b8k",1,1569545861,"2019-09-27 00:57:41"

&amp;#x200B;

What is the reason for his repetitive behaviour? If this happens on a regular basis, those could be compulsions and is possibly part of a different disorder. It is not a criteria for ADHD.

Besides, I think it is really sweet that you are asking advice how to talk to him. You tried talking to him? What are you afraid for when you address this? Besides... after such a long relationship things are becoming more irritating. So please find a way to tell him. IF he can't do something about it...:  
1. Honey please stop the banging! And he will stop... he will start again because it is probably a habit. But habits are learned, so new ones can be learned as well. Reminds me of my ex that was clapping when my posture was bad. After a while I start making the clapping sounds myself and correcting my posture without her being around...  
2. Change also needs to come from you. You are in control of YOUR experiences. Let's be honest; the same situation isn't irritated in every situation, sometimes we can let something go. That is the power that is within you. The banging noises maybe can't change, but the way you feel emotions can.

"9308","Man I’m sorry to hear that. When I was a kid I had a number of teachers refer me to a councillor due to my erratic and inattentive behaviour. 

Mum refused to take me to the sessions or have me medicated. Instead she sent me to an after-school church program believing I would be disciplined by “God”.

She’d drop me off to the church and I would just walk over to the nearest park until I was ready to be picked up. She didn’t find out I was truanting until the day of our holy communion ceremony, where they told her I only showed up to one class a few months back. I was then forced to go to a proper catholic school, isolated from my friends and it only made my ADHD worse. I was punished so frequently for my inattentive behaviour that eventually I was expelled and dropped out of school.

10 hard years later and after accumulating a lot of debt, anxiety and depression, I was diagnosed. Last year I told mum about it and for the first time ever I witnessed her cry. I think she always new but struggled to believe her daughter had a mental disorder. 

She was in the Bosnian War back in the early 90’s, witnessed many close friends die and other horrible events I couldn’t even begin to imagine. I’m certain she has PTSD, but refuses to accept it. She hides her emotions well, and growing up I’ve always had any negative emotions invalidated with the phrase “there are people currently living in refuge, starving. There are always people who have it worse. You have no right to be upset.” You can imagine how that conditioning can lead to avoidance, which I believe is a huge factor of ADHD symptoms. 

After seeing a therapist, I realised that I had inherited intergenerational trauma and only recently have I learned to forgive my past and trauma during childhood. Mum isn’t supportive of the medication however recently I have heard a bit of feedback around my ability to manage my time and savings, so I hope that in the future she will begin to see that they actually do help and medication is sometimes necessary.

Neither, it's totally normal. Nobody can just browse through their memory like files on a hard drive. Our brains encode memories and only recall them when they receive certain cues. That encoding process is dependent upon attention -- that's where ADHD memory issues arise. It's not that we can't recall information we've stored, it's that we don't store as much information in the first place.","dynhey6",2,1525800898,"2018-05-08 17:34:58"

"9323","Ben, this sounds like a total bummer and I totally sympathise. The only thing I would note from personal experience of trialling two different methylphenidate meds in the UK (Concerta and Medikinet XL), is that there was a world of difference between the two in how they affected me. I switched to Concerta for a month to compare it to Medikinet and found it not only ineffective in treating ADD symptoms, but exacerbated depression and a general feeling of malaise.

I've since settled on 2 daily doses of 40mg Medikinet, which works like a dream and in fact gives my mood a real boost. Obviously, this is just my own annecdotal experience, but the takeaway perhaps is that if you can bear it and your doctor is on board, it might be worth trying a different brand of methylphenidate before moving on.

"9365","Yeah I think a therapist or a phycologist (?) Would be beneficial, although I wouldn't really like doing it. I guess I don't open up often, hesistant on sharing, etc. I try to talk to my loving parents, but I feel like I annoy them at times, and dont always completely understand (hell, I hardly do at times).


I try to make my sleep schedule consistent, same bedtime, same wake time, but it never sticks.

I always try to get at least 7hours, well, it's probably worse than that because that's when I try to go to bed. But 8, or even 9, I'd my sweet spot.

Getting not enough sleep doesn't happen too often, as it makes me totally useless and it's AWFUL with meds. Not effective, and just feels uncomfortable at times. I avoid it at all costs. I'll even miss class if needed to get sleep, if I could not sleep well(not often, lavender helps a lot, melatonin maybe does).

Other times I just stay up to late, focused on work, partly because I start working to late know the day. (Before or after I started meds). Or I guess I just distract myself, kind of like sleep procrastination for the next day, didnt really realize this, but I think it's that. Maybe cause if depression or anxiety more than I realize

I really need to get a static schedule, and my doc insists on it too.


I'll try being more proactive and mindful with my focusing and strats to help. Lists do help at times, other times I'll write it out and it gets ignored, forgotten, and lost (rarely). I think I big part is just avoidance underneath of it, maybe, scared of failure, I don't know. If I don't fully try and I fail? Well it's because I didn't try. If I try and fail? Then I'm either dumb/failure/idk. I don't activitly think that, but it's just rooted in the back of my mind.

All I know meds for sure, made any procrastination worse: longer and harder to stop.

It all seemed to stem from Legos and/or K’nex for me. I would get a set, build it then realize I didn’t like the way they built or designed something and I’d take it apart and fix it or change it, then I’d keep modifying until it was nothing like where I started then abandon it and/or start on something new. I’d build way beyond the age recommendations without any help and be occupied by building with Legos for hours on end without realizing time was going by. 

Sometimes during the summers I’d have on the TV for some background noise and be building all day and night. My parents thought it was great I could occupy myself but I never got tested until I was an adult. Because I could focus on things I wanted to but not what needed to get done, along with rarely being at my desk and not finishing projects. My boss spoke candidly with me and asked me to talk to my Dr, he thinks I may have a form of ADD/ADHD. I’m glad he said this as I’m 28 now and my Dr just put me on Adderall last week and the results have been incredible.

"9376","Old school psychiatrists were also trained in psychotherapy/talk therapy modalities. Nowadays, a psychiatrists method of practice is more based on psychopharmacological treatments.
Here's my breakdown of who does what:

LPC: Licensed Professional Counselor - they can provide mental health assessments, and provide mental health treatments through psychotherapy or other therapeutic treatment modalities.

PhD: Psychologist who likely has additional, specialized training in providing therapy. Typically does not have training in the biomedical field. They can also provide mental health evaluations and treatment. Does not prescribe medication.

LMSW/LCSW: Clinical social worker who can provide mental health assessments and therapy treatment. They may have a different spin on how to approach mental health. 

Psychiatrist: Either MD or DO - the medical doc who does mental health evaluations and biomedical treatment for the determined mental health condition. The direction they want to go for medical treatment is based on a number of factors, so sometimes they will not prescribe medication due to a biomedical or ethical reason.

Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner: Medical professional with specialized training in psychiatric/mental health treatment. Can prescribe medications.

Neuropsychiatrist: a PhD who specializes in cognitive testing to assess mental health conditions. This is a bit more balanced with qualitative and quantitative tests and assessments to determine something like ADHD. They typically do not provide treatment, but will often recommend interventions and treatments.


Sometimes your PCP will automatically direct you to one of the mental health professionals listed above. Sometimes you are sent to a person who does not specialize in the service you would like to receive (like sent to a LPC but wanted to see someone who has the ability to prescribe medication). Sometimes a PCP would like you to see a therapist in addition to seeing a psychiatrist. The same point with a psychiatrist - sometimes they want you to see a therapist as well. 

Hopefully, this gives a little more clarity to a pretty confusing mental health system.","dw11gxb",1,1521597813,"2018-03-21 02:03:33"

A person takes 20mg at 8am and their half-life is 12 hours.  This means, at 8pm, they have half of the med left in their bloodstream, or 10.  

If that same person takes 40, at 8pm they will have 20 in their bloodstream, or the maximum that they would have had at any point at the smaller dose.

So when you take a higher dose, you get more and it has a stronger effect.  It will also last longer because it has a higher starting point and decreases exponentially.","chxmxdl",2,1401754667,"2014-06-03 00:17:47"

I've given up on looking for ""that one thing"" that will work out for me, and have instead accepted that there'll never be one thing and with ADHD it will always be more about the journey.

"9391","Yes I started doing lists. I have a Goodreads Account, and a Letterboxd account. Both there I have lists with books and movies. I have the fantasy that as I soon want to watch a movie, I just go to my list and pick the first one and just let it roll and enjoy the process.

But in reality the lists are just getting bigger and bigger. I hear somebody talking about a book and i think about ""This must be life-changing and so emotional and so exciting, I NEED to read this."" - Boom added it to the list. 

So when deciding I don't pick the first movie and go movie by movie. I scroll through them and can't decide. And if I just randomly pick one, I get second thoughts like after 10 minutes, if it was the right choice, and the other movies seemed so interesting, why am I not watching one of those.

The same with books. I am currently reading a book, which I am kind of enjoying. I have 100 pages left. Now when I read it's not that I just let myself go and enjoy the final pages. I now have the feeling of I Have to finish the last 100 pages, because I want to go on the next book of my list, which sounds so damn interesting. So now the book which I in fact enjoy is hard work for me, just so I can get to the next one, without having bad thoughts.

And that's the thing then I have the next book, which I think will be soooo amazing, and as soon as I start I will get disappointed and just want to get done with it, so I can jump to the next one.","dqlpgxn",2,1512123378,"2017-12-01 10:16:18"

Do you think you still have problems with focus/attention, or are these other things holding you back? If you read moderately interesting things, can you read a whole page, or do you have to switch back and forth?

That's a good indicator of whether or not the meds are working.

As for the therapy - what kind of therapy are you taking? CBT? Remember that psychiatrists usually will give you drugs, but won't help you much in getting your life in order.

Finally, how about getting out to people? Taking yoga or meditation class? Or Toastmasters? These are the places that will get you moving, and get you out of house. If you're super-short on cash, most of these places will let you in for free once you ask, I think.

"9442","This is my personal experience and I am obviously not able or trying to give any medical advice.

I have been taking 54mg of Concerta. My doctor told me to take it when necessary, eg for studying or demanding days at work. I take it in the morning and I feel the effects for about 12h: focus, but also virtually no appetite and no feeling of exhaustion whatsoever.

During Christmas break I like to sleep in (because I am ✨sleep deprived✨) and eat all the delicious foods. If I sleep until about 10 am and take my meds right after waking up, I would be able to focus until about midnight... but I would also miss out on nice foods, or if I somewhat forced myself to eat anyways, I would be feeling sick from eating and struggling to sleep off my food hang over lol.

Plus, I dont feel the need of that extra focus during social interactions. Today I am not doing anything remotely mentally challenging, thats why I enjoy my appetite, my tiredness and my switching thoughts. It actually helps me be social because I am much more talkative when I dont feel my thoughts being filtered or sifted. 

I will be back on the grind tomorrow, but for today, I like to let my mind wander, to eat all the foods I want and to take a nap if I want. Because without my meds I can. It gives me a much needed break from productivity. I also feel the need to be productive when taking my meds because otherwise they would be kinda wasted on nothing.","ggwoh06",1,1608825897,"2020-12-24 16:04:57"

In The Netherlands, we generally don't write such documents, as we feel your own physician can't do that objectively and doing so can risk the patient doctor relationship; you might aggravate or play down your symptoms, for instance.
We hand out this document explaining that: http://www.knmg.nl/web/file?uuid=550291ca-b494-4eab-852e-36ab6b1a526d&amp;owner=80fb0b25-0b16-441f-8e19-2137dd0cacf9

"9445","I was recently diagnosed and prescribed 40 mg of vyvanse, and I have no issue taking it as prescribed, and I don't feel the need to take it on the weekends unless I have work to do. Before I was diagnosed, I felt the need to take other drugs, mainly weed, to alleviate my symptoms or just to feel better, but usually these drugs wouldn't be to help me focus, but to take the edge off so I could feel better. I knew I wasn't helping myself, but my brain didn't care. Since I've been taking vyvanse, I no longer feel the urge to take other drugs, because it is really the only drug I need to be content and feel like I have control. Most people with ADHD have addictive personalities because they are constantly seeking more dopamine, and drugs are the easiest solution, which is why around 80% of people with untreated ADHD will develop a drug addiction (I could be wrong on the percentage, but I know it's around 80%) at some point in their life, because they will seek dopamine in any way possible to feel relief. Not saying you will get addicted to ADHD meds, because you probably won't especially if you are as careful as you are being, but if I had to be dependent on any drug, I would rather be dependent on  vyvanse than just about anything else, because it makes me feel content with life AND it helps my ADHD. It turns me into the person I feel like I'm supposed to be rather than a person that I'm not, like many other drugs do.","e8ow3ed",1,1540852156,"2018-10-29 22:29:16"

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

Or, panicking over a presentation: ""you *just* have to get dressed and go to class."" Followed by, ""you *just* have to keep talking for 3 minutes to pass the class and never ever have speak in public again"" 

The problem is when people present huge ideas (like *just* getting all your work in on time - or worse, some colloquialism like *just* buckling down) as something so minute anyone can do it.

It's more of a risk factor than a given.  But every Rx med has a long list of risk factors.  So I get confused why it is treated as a lot more likely than other risk factors on other meds.  I'm also on lamictal, and that has a high risk factor of developing a serious rash.  But they weren't hesitant to Rx it to me, they just wanted me to report right away if I noticed a problem.

If anything the amps reduce mania/psychosis symptoms.  If I have racing thoughts or music looping or voices rambling on about random things, the amphetamine just makes my brain completely quiet.

Don't kid yourself, there's no excuse for the way he treated you, and I really admire the fact that despite your ADHD went undiagnosed for so long, you still demonstrated alot of willpower and determination in getting back on your feet later in life. 

 At one time, I almost had something similar with my parents, definitely not as bad, but there was a sense of 'is something wrong with this kid? Why can't he just sit down and work for 3 minutes?' 


They eventually put me on medication, but my dad resisted at first. He said it was 'unnatural' and didn't make sense to drug me up. In the end though, I had a few struggles with the side effects but overall, I think he came round in the end. The funny thing is, my mom told me he didn't even believe the condition existed when I was young, but as I grew older, I suddenly realized that my dad exhibited all the signs of ADHD, and probably suffered it even worse than me. In the end though, iambob's right, don't ever pin the insecurities of others onto yourself as your own fault. You did pretty good in my books, and honestly, it's nice to have a dad who appreciates you, but if he doesn't, and you genuinely a good guy, then let him stew in his own hate.

does not sound like ADHD. Now, I'm definitely not a doctor and not qualified in any way (so take this with a grain of salt) but there really is no ""self"" to get back to when you have ADHD, it's something you're born with.  

According to the DSM-5, multiple ADHD symptoms have to be present before the age of 12 in order for a diagnosis to be made, so it's unusual for an individual to suddenly ""get"" ADHD and start exhibiting symptoms that haven't been present before.  

However, there are numerous other disorders that can make it difficult to concentrate and can decrease motivation, such as anxiety, depression and PTSD.

Also I've never heard the approach that you're required to try max dose IR before trialing XR. Many physicians and psychiatrists actually start with XR from the get go, and some exclusively use XR (sometimes with an IR booster afternoon dose). If you've never been on stimulants before and you're starting with max dose, I would certainly expect that you're experiencing considerable euphoria. That doesn't mean your meds won't ""work"" in the future, but you likely won't feel like this forever.

For me, I took it as a good thing that I didn't react horribly to it or have side effects from the get go! It may take a few weeks/months to titrate your dose, depending on your psych's preference. I've worked my way up and I'm at 40mg per day currently. Once I increased the dose, I could definitely tell it was working. I'm still not certain of my ideal dose and I know I'll never feel 100%, but the med gives such a huge boost. Don't worry, you'll get there. Hopefully your psych will titrate your dose; if you're still not feeling a benefit or having side effects then there are other medications. The beauty of these meds is that there's so many options out there, you *will* find something that works for you. It's just going to take time. Be patient, you have your whole life ahead of you. You cannot let this make or break you. I just got diagnosed at 30, and I can't even imagine how much more I'd have achieved in life if I'd started meds back then. Try to focus on the fact that you have a diagnosis and a psych who is willing to prescribe meds and work with you. Many people run into difficulty even accomplishing that much.

What country are you in? In the US doctors treat stimulants as the first line of defense because it's around 90% effective. Medication is the *only* way to get rid of ADHD symptoms, and it's the only ADHD treatment that's proven to work reliably. 

&gt;It might fix my attention, but it won't keep me from being a disorganized and procrastinating mess. I'm afraid it won't even fix my attention at all

There are two main stimulants, plus atypical stimulants and two non-stimulant options that work in different ways. You will definitely find something that will fix your attention. 

&gt;I'm seeing a new psychiatrist on Monday. I'm so scared of so many things. First of all, I'm scared of not being able to tell her my whole story. I'm terrible at expressing myself.

For me, the first visit was an intake appointment. The actual *diagnosis* was given as a result of a computer test and a questionnaire with one-sentence questions. So I never really had to be super organized when it mattered. 

Besides, these people are used to seeing people with ADHD. I forgot my school records for the intake appointment but it all worked out. 

&gt;I just feel sad and hopeless. And I like what I study too, I really wanted to have a good career. Maybe I could if I ""tried hard enough""

ADHD isn't about ""trying hard enough"" it's about being physically incapable because of how your brain is wired. Don't think you're lazy. Depression is comorbid with ADHD and has similar symptoms, so you're going to have to look back to your childhood/adolescence for symptoms then. For the record, it's totally possible to do well in school and still have ADHD if you're smart. ","d7ga3x3",2,1473460989,"2016-09-09 22:43:09"

My mom taught me a good work ethic. Anyway, I always do well at work, partly because I'm a good faker, and partly for survival - if I don't work, I don't eat. 

That said, I struggle with concentration at work a lot. There are days when I can't focus on anything and I spend 8 hours doing nothing in front of a computer (though this is fixed now with medication). I am a good faker though. With emails for example, I put them off a lot, I just make sure I don't put off the ones for my boss so he sees me as productive. I am fortunate that I take projects and have a unique position so there is no one to compare it to, and I can fluff up what I'm working on. As long as it looks to them like I do a lot, I get good reviews. 

So the point is, on paper, I look like an amazing worker, but I know the truth which is I could be ten times better and I waste way too much time.

"9556","Medication greatly helps me manage my emotions, the irrational highs and lows, identifying thoughts, having more logic during discussions, higher moods overall, and listening. However I'm still having the same problem as you, and medication isn't my saving grace. I HAVE to take it to get by in my relationship, however, it's not enough alone. 

I've had to do a lot of research into my own personal problems such as the communication issues, learning how to listen, learning how to self soothe, ACT (somewhat like CBT), I've had to do a lot of work... the ADHD symptoms are still there. Forgetting important things, not learning from my mistakes, talking too fast, mood swings, etc etc.. these all affect my relationship.. even with medication. But they are lessened. Unfortunately I think I'm in a relationship with someone that can't handle any sort of issue, so no matter how hard I try it will never be enough. 

So, I can't say whether medication will be your saving grace. I don't know your exact issues in the relationship. I do know that it would probably help the symptoms if those are causing the issues. But you may still have to work really hard, or you maybe you're just with someone that can't tough it out. Maybe all the issues aren't even yours.. I know that my partner won't even negotiate on his issues because mine are so much more massive and damaging. He won't indulge in the fact I need positive affirmations regularly, because of all the other issues I've caused. Everything comes back on me. I really hope that isn't happening to you!

Definitely try to get the medication if you can, to test it out. But also try to identify the issues and do research into what else you can do to learn how to mitigate them.. or if the problem in fact lies with the other party.. (my counselor says I need to find a partner that doesn't want to change me and will like me, for me, for example).","fyjgh7a",1,1595144614,"2020-07-19 07:43:34"
"9557","In short apply the whole ""what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger"" spiel. So, like me, you're probably a bit annoyed you didn't find out earlier, ""help and/or medication would have seriously helped my academic life"" right? Well our consolation is that we have lived through our childhood trying to do what is expected of an average brain. We've been playing the game of life on a higher difficulty thus we depend less on the ""cushions"" available to us, a gift, not a necessity.

As for your wife, I read a lot on ADHD, hyperfocus kicks in on facts concerning my own body/mind. anyway:

if she thinks the medication is a cop-out:

- Medication, unlike the seemingly common consensus it isn't some cheap-easy focus drug, it tries to sort out the chemical imbalances in our brain such as dopamine, on top of that for a lot of us our dopamine receptors aren't doing fabulous either... (take a look at DRD4 gene if you're interested). For a normal person the medication in high enough dosages may have effects akin to taking speed (In the case of Adderall atleast) .

If her problem is that she believes ADHD is not real:

- EEG scans can often determine a patient with ADHD by lower than average brain wave frequencies. We usually have an excess of theta and/or alpha brain waves. Excess theta waves are more common in children with ADHD, excess alpha waves are more common in adults with ADHD. By some it is believed that hyperactivity may be a coping mechanism of sorts to deal with the excess theta waves to keep us more awake (which might explain why often the hyperactive symptoms become less prevalent in adulthood, haven't looked into this enough so don't quote me on that)

- While it isn't an official diagnosis they've found that you can accurately determine a patient with ADHD using an MRI scan, not quite sure about how they work... but yeah.

Both of those are actual physical suggestions of a problem, not some made up condition to describe being lazy.


If she believes you will use it as a scapegoat:

- You haven't used it yet, don't start now regardless of how tempting it may be. Then there shouldn't be a problem.

"9566","This is going to be long,  sorry but just a question,  How'd you come round to thinking you possibly had it. 

I recently was looking up the symptoms for school and came across this subreddit, and pretty much everything has hit home, from both people's experiences and the symptoms listed on websites. 

I realised many of these problems were pretty defined back in primary school and middle school. 

However, I am doing well in school (I'm in my final year (17yo) in Australia and finishing my exams in 14 days)  averaging As and A+s, but that's because I study at home without distractions since at school im always zoning out after like 15 mins.  What's stopping me from achieving hundi's is simple stupid mistakes which for some reason I can never fix. (I heard this can also be a symptom) 

So just curious how you came round to thinking you had it? 

I've always felt different from everybody else I know, especially in a social setting because I find general convos and other people  talking boring as fuck.  

If I ask a question,  I usually end up zoning out when they're speaking and going off tangents than realising halfway through. 

I am also a MASSIVE procrastinator and looking around my room all my notes and books are everywhere in random piles. 

I never miss someone when they're not around. 

My biggest fear is going for a diagnosis because I am functioning very well atm in society  ""faking it till I make it""  (took me like the last 4 years to learn)  so everyone shrugs me off and says I probs don't since I can mask it all well. 

Someone did suggest I did once but because whenever I speak my mind asking someone something or suggesting an idea I stutter or speak fast and make absolutely no sense, I've noticed a lot of people especially teachers ask me to repeat what I said because they said they didn't understand my point the first time. 

I also noticed I'm always fidgeting, Wether it's my foot, bouncing my leg,  or constantly twirling a pen in my hand or my phone such as on a bus which I've noticed I always do.

Music is my escape but that also increases my fidgeting, without music Idk if I could cope with how dull life seems. 

Terrible self esteem too, it's gotten amazingly better in the past year (now I just feel like people are judging me when I talk/hang around them) , originally stemming from being bullied back in primary school basically for having no spatial awareness and saying whatever was in my head and being competitive. 

Now

First your question about having 3 months of adderall at a time: Assuming you're in the US and there are no state guidelines in play, it's the only legal way to give out prescriptions for controlled substances like Adderall without being seen or making equivalent arrangements (e.g. drop by the office to pick up a prescription) every month. It's a convenience thing for doctors and patients alike. See http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2007/fr1119.htm

Second, your question about what she wrote to the school? Maybe you can just ask her next time you see her, without making assumptions about why she wrote it.

If you sit with him, he's going to focus on you and miss the class activity entirely.  That's not going to be beneficial to him in the long run.  

It's perfectly okay to tell the teacher that you've noticed Martin can be a handful and ask them what they'd prefer you do to help Martin out.  Martin may have an IEP or 504 plan filed with the school that allows him to test differently (out loud rather than on paper, for example) and lays out what his educational plan is, including how to handle his problem behaviors.  If that's the case, the school is bound by federal law to follow that plan.  Asking the teacher where you can best pitch in is going to be your best bet.

This is such an important point.  It's what stood out for me in your post.

Why are these important people in your life not supporting you?  You need to stand up for yourself, and tell them they are NOT helping.  Fuck them.

Also, everyone who starts an exercise program falls off the wagon one day.  That doesn't give you permission to give up entirely.  The next day you have to pick it up again.

"9639","&gt;Wow this! I've been thinking on how trippy it is to have differences in your brain, because that's going to alter your perception of literally everything. I think, therefore I am type stuff.

Yep; neurological issues are fundamentally *all* existential crises waiting to happen the second you think about them. Look into Korsakoff's some time, if you want to see the fucking scariest thing that can happen to a human being.

You can literally lose the entirety of your Self, and I don't mean Amnesia. There are people out there with literally no memory of anything that happened more than a few minutes ago, that do not know this is the case; every time you speak to them, they'll create a new Self, out of whole cloth, complete with detailed backstories and anecdotes and personality traits. And then, a few minutes later, it'll be gone, because that person was just something the brain improvised on the fly.

&gt;People don't really, truly get how subconscious the majority of things are. Most of the brain is still used for basic animal things, as far as we know, because there's a lot about the brain we don't know. To think anyone has the capability to override that by just thinking more is underestimating nature... Which is rarely a good idea.

It's worse than that, honestly; it's fundamentally misunderstanding what human beings are and the nature of physical reality. The idea of 'free will' or that a person can just overcome the shortcomings of their brain is a bit like expecting an engine cylinder to overcome the fact that a car's out of gas; you and me are only one of *many* systems in our brains, not the Ghosts in the Machines in charge of *all* of it. 

It's not underestimating nature, it's a holdover from the idea that we're a soul that has a body, rather than a particularly strange and difficult to explain emergent phenomena from different biological neural networks communicating with a maximum of 400ms latency.","eluakho",3,1556294867,"2019-04-26 16:07:47"

I get so bored and sometimes I can't even force myself to do anything and have to bail out early. Leads to guilt and anxiety of course. 

I have an appointment next week with my doctor and I'm going to see about switching to Adderall XR with an ER for the end of the day. I have a gene that metabolizes the methylphenidate faster which makes it less effective for me. I was on 20mg Adderall XR for maybe a month, stopped because I thought it was giving me a bloody nose, but it was just allergies since that didn't go away with Concerta lol. 

It's hard to know about balancing med dose vs. behavioral therapy work. I don't want to keep increasing either, especially because I've read that it's not safe to be on the meds when you're pregnant, and that's a future goal of mine. 

I keep thinking about how I was without it- my main thing was anxiety which started me down this path.

"9649","You are asking for legal advice. I’d try to find a person who could give you genuine professional advisement as to whether it is ‘allowed’.
What I would say is this, your manager is not going to give you serving shifts at the bar because of your ‘going down stairs too often and messing up the other servers’.

Is your bathroom use causing unequal distribution of the workload or workflow problems on the service floor in your opinion?
Have there been any recorded issues relating to your bathroom usage, like complaints from guests or other staff? Are there ‘records’ like forms or emails?
Does this affect your overall pay? (# of shifts, hours per shift, tips per shift)

From a restaurant standpoint, it’s a time sensitive gig. Regardless of the reason for it, no matter how valid, if you are not in the right place at the right time, you’ve failed. 

For a service manager and boss, the focus SHOULD BE on working with any server whose putting in the effort to show up and do the job. They should be focused on what actions they can take to create a situation where you can thrive as a server. Maybe this means putting you closer to the bathroom?

If they can’t find a way to run service and let you go to the bathroom when you need to they’ve failed or they aren’t willing to put in the effort to have a strong staff and you should jump from that sinking ship as quick as you can.

It may be that, in this situation, the only way they can accommodate you would be to limit your shifts, and maybe that does constitute discrimination.
But if this limitation doesn’t affect hours / tips, then I guess it is just sort of an accommodation?
Either way, nobody should be asking about your medication unless you spilled them into someone’s food / drink or are visibly intoxicated by its effects.","g7mad7i",1,1601786828,"2020-10-04 04:47:08"

"9654","Grades whether good or bad do not fully determine ADHD.  Many of us got good grades up until a certain point. The ""pleasure-seeking"" things he is talking about are more than likely your brain looking for dopamine; ADHD individuals are deficient in dopamine, which is the neurotransmitter for pleasure after all... I think your boyfriend needs to become educated on ADHD before he assumes things. I can recommend the youtube channel ""How To ADHD."" The girl who makes the videos is extremely informative, and she sheds light on some of the other aspects of the condition that people don't typically know about. The common way people think of  ADHD is like: ""OMG LOOK A SQUIRREL!"" and bad grades, but truthfully there is much more to it than that.

As the other poster has said, maybe explain to them that your psychologist is a professional, and that he should trust the diagnosis that the psych has given you.

Relationships between an ADHD and non ADHD partner can be difficult, however not impossible. It is difficult for the non ADHD'er to understand what it's like to have ADHD. The youtube channel I mentioned above also has videos on this.

I've been reading my son ""The Hobbit"" and I can't very well speed through the lists of the dwarves names unless I want to end up tongue tied. 

My son, who also has ADHD, has a mild articulation delay. He talks very quickly, using very large words discussing very complicated topics. Getting him to slow down is a daily task for me.

"9665","&gt;Firstly let me warn you that if you do get stimulant medication, you're going to want insurance companies to pay for it, and if you're on one of you're parents insurance plans they'll know (I'm just guessing you are).

Really?  How will they know?  I'm honestly curious.

When I was much younger (late teens), I worried about that kind of thing.  And it's sometimes brought up by college-aged women as an argument against using oral contraceptives.  But since I've been paying for my own insurance, it's occurred to me that I've never once gotten any sort of 'report' detailing my prescription usage, or naming the prescriptions I'm on, and I've been with several different companies.  And I don't recall ever actually seeing my parents get any such report or notification.

So, has anyone else ever really had that happen?  Because, as far as I know, once you're 18+ (and even younger, in some countries), your medical history, including any prescriptions you're on, is confidential.

"9690","Also, the personal organizers, who had experience working with people with ADHD, pointed out some issues I had:

I had trouble persisting when given repeated piles of stuff to sort through and choose whether to keep or discard each item. I would get fatigued and frustrated. At times, I would get distracted by what I was looking at or I would have a mental block preventing me from even making a decision.

I had to take frequent breaks from the tasks while the organizers worked. I felt best when taking the trash out.

When choosing what clothes to keep or throw out, I struggled. I have difficulty even wrapping my mind around or comprehending the clothes I'm looking at. The organizers, however, did one thing that made it much easier: They laid out clothes by category, first the t-shirts, then the sweatshirts, then the pants, on so on. The decision-making process was much simpler and less like trying to find your way through the dark. With just a single type of clothing laid out each time, I made my decisions and was satisfied with the process.

At times I would get distracted by another task that needed to be done and had to be redirected by the organizers.

I was so so tired of spending all of psychotherapy just talking about the issues and about how having a messy apartment made me feel. Yuck! I'm glad to have finally done something real.

I read the list above to my psychiatrist and he said that this is clearly ADHD, which I was first diagnosed with at 5, though more severe issues at 13 caused it to fall by the wayside. I asked my psychiatrist why and he said when you have a gangrenous leg you don't worry about an ingrown toenail.","cxs5par",3,1449617029,"2015-12-08 23:23:49"

"9693","It’s tough because I think the path diagnosis varies among those of us who were diagnosed in adulthood. I also never considered adhd... ever. I went to weekly counseling and my therapist observed that my anxiety wasn’t managed well with current meds. We tried practicing self-calming techniques and she noticed that I struggled to focus. It was completely by accident. She shared with me some one page questionnaires to have a family member and a close friend complete and return to her. I did the questionnaire too. Once she had those all returned, she shared them along with her own observational notes to a psychologist at the office and they confirmed adhd. 

I would suggest bringing it up with your primary or a therapist who you see regularly and have a rapport with.

"9696","I think you should definitely have it looked into, I recognize a lot of those things from myself as well, ADHD-PI with a hint of anxiety (sometimes called evasive personality).

A few tips in the meantime:  
Always have a block of paper and two pens out so you can easily access them.  
When there is something you want to do but can't seem to get started, break it into small steps on a piece of paper. Cleaning a room can be lots of little steps like ""get trash sorted in this part, put things away in that part, clean one part, etc."". Then give yourself the blessing to just do one part, you can do more after if you want but just do one and feel good about striking it from the list. Miracles won't happen but you can make a little progress.

Let your IRL friends, SO, or family know that you are happy they initiated a thing, even if you have to say 'no' tell them know that you are glad they asked.  
When we are bad at doing the things that make relationships work we have to make sure those who take the steps feel appreciated, when we never initiate they start to suspect we don't like them.

This one is going to sound impossible: But take care what you eat and try to get some exercise, also try to keep steady sleep hours.  
It helps more than you might think, but obviously it is also some hard thing for ADHD people to get done. I have been able to tell lately that if I eat mostly carbohydrates (bread, fries, ice-cream, pasta, rice, cake, ketchup) one day, the next day activation for tasks is even harder and the ""I don't want to be around anyone today"" is tenfold. Fat is not as bad as people thought previously, and protein is great.  
Not getting proper sleep also increases the likelihood of saying something stupid as well as making even the smallest tasks seem daunting. Sleep medicine is somewhat overused but having some to reset your sleep rhythm on occasion might be a good idea (it has worked well for me), assuming you struggle with that stuff like a lot of us do.    
Some exercise can make everything just constantly a little better.  
Start with considering the food, that one is the easiest to accomplish I think.

Edit: One more that I just remembered. Even if you are not going anywhere or seeing anyone, bathe at least every 2 days. I don't really know why it matters but it seems to.","dhrhnbq",1,1495195161,"2017-05-19 11:59:21"

I developed a block around doing algebra that lasted me OVER 3 years, which of course seriously impaired my educational outcomes.

"9720","Same, I don't even enjoy my old favorites with my brothers/friends, beacuse then I would have to learn how to play the new stuff. Unless I have nothing to do at all, which is really rare.

But it doesn't have to be like that. I only play one game, but I am passionate about it. I don't play for fun, but for the esport part. For improving my decision-making skills, focusing, multitasking, creativity. Also for it's community. I felt guilty too, but I won't let my parents make every decision for me, even subconsciously, when they don't even know what is gaming like and it's much better than watching long, never-ending series, learning for unnecessary subjects, having a hobby where I have to travel a lot. They give a motivation buff in the shortest time span. So it makes me focused. I am even a ""one trick pony"", which means I play only one champion, so that I can actually improve with the time I got. But this champion has a lot of combos and situations so I never get bored of it. ^^ League of legends if you haven't guessed it yet. Play games only if you have fun with them, for me, fun is improving, which can be anything.","f4zd8dm",1,1571904266,"2019-10-24 08:04:26"

"9742","Before Adderall: Couldn't focus on literally anything for more than 45 seconds at best, no exaggeration. The exception being games, because they checked both boxes of enjoyment AND rewarding. Shower OR brushing my teeth (just one or the other, both was like solving advanced physics for me) just once in a week was a huge achievement! 

After Adderall, but before Welbutrin for the depression:Gained focus to pay attention to things, but only fun things like  games and TV. The INSTANT that something stopped entertaining me, I'd switch to checking my phone for something more entertaining, only half hearing the tv(before Adderall, if I'm not watching the tv i literally don't hear it, like it's on silent unless something big and shocking sounding happened). 

After Adderall and Welbutrin: Super ridiculous surge in motivation. I NEED to be productive. If I'm not doing something productive I feel weird and antsy.

 However, if you happen to skip meals most days because of it, you will royally fuck up your metabolism. Essentially, your body wont make to good use of the food it takes in and it will go to fat etc.

You know the great things you're capable of and you know the times when you have to do things differently to get them done. Don't let anyone else convince you differently. 

I got a college degree and taught myself to excel in several of my interests with no medication. (I'm currently having to rebalance my life because I've taken on rather more than I can handle, so I'm trying to figure out how to work with it and with myself, but I'll get it figured out.) I know people with ADHD who have made great lives for themselves and accomplished their ambitious goals, from working in medicine to writing a novel to programming.

ADHD makes things hard, but it doesn't make any of us incapable. It just means sometimes we need to come at things differently. (And it may be easier to make some of those accommodations for yourself when you're living on your own. Also, consider getting a few physical pads of paper and pencils for times when your Apple Pencil is lost, so you can still ground yourself.)

"9759","Ah I understand that- but for many people especially students and those who are below the poverty line, they are actually a hindrance to getting a diagnosis. Where I live it would cost me about $1000 out of pocket to get the damn thing, which would mean I would never have gotten help. That is over 8 months worth of food which I desperately needed. That $1000 is the cost of my university books for an entire year and a half. I know I'm not the only one who has been through that. I didn't have medical coverage at the time, so I would have had to go to another doctor who had a wait list of 2 years. That 2 years of waiting would have costed me the chance to fight my depression, to finish my degree and enter an internship program. It's kind of like saying ""if you are poor, too bad you can't get diagnosed with ADHD- it's only for those who can get medical coverage or those who can pay out of pocket.""

"9778","I'm not a doctor, but I am a psych student with ADHD and a few other issues so I can offer some insight with a few things here...

When I was younger, they suspected ADHD and ran a few tests, however they ruled it impossible to say with certainty as a few other disabilities (learning disabilities mainly) carried overlapping symptoms so they weren't sure. Finally one psychiatrist diagnosed me BUT since the medications they tried on me were ineffective, they said it was untreatable and should be ignored in favor of addressing the other issues. Why I'm mentioning this is because ADHD is so so so comorbidly diagnosed (meaning diagnosed with other disorders) that when one thing is treated, another rears it's ugly head. Think of some one who has depression and anxiety, most people I've spoken with who have both (myself included) it's one or the other (kinda hard to fear for your life when you want to kill yourself) so if you treated say, the depression, the anxiety would become more obvious and appear worse. This could be happening to you as well. You may have underlying issues that are hidden when not on medication so when you do take medication, they appear worse because you're no longer experiencing the brunt of your ADHD.

As a side note, you say the only time you got things done is when you used caffeine and cigarettes, just wanted to say that ADHD causes people to constantly seek dopamine, thus pleasure. Drug use, and smoking is common with us. Before I started taking better medication I would drink 3 red bulls a day just to function and I've herd a lot of ADHDers say that caffeine helps them focus so I'm not surprised.

I think the thing you need to do right now is see a psychiatrist who is specialized with ADHD patients and start trying medications, everyone is different and medications work differently for everyone - finding the right one is a process.","f27mi2n",1,1570041523,"2019-10-02 18:38:43"

"9792","We feel the neurodiversity movement is harmful to people with ADHD. While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

"9833","&gt;Because they would open themselves and/or their department up to a massive wrongful arrest lawsuit?

So, how is that different from this scenario:

&gt; they could still arrest the person and tell them to work it out with the judge. Obviously any charge relating to that would be thrown out, but it doesn't mean it won't seriously inconvenience the person.

If the charge would obviously be thrown out, it would ""open themselves and/or their department up to a massive wrongful arrest lawsuit"".

Edit, from the response to this post: 
&gt;[Here is a nice story about what can happen to you in some states in the US.](http://edfolsomlaw.com/2013/01/illegal-possession-of-your-own-prescription-drugs/)

Very convincing article.  It would be more convincing if it could tell the difference between scheduled and prescription medications, but it can't. It would be more convincing for your point if it - and the Maine law in question - didn't specifically exempt repackaging for more convenient use.

&gt;[...only in the container in which it was delivered by the person selling or dispensing the drug or substance. **For purposes of this subsection, ""when in use"" includes reasonable repackaging for more convenient legitimate medical use.**](http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/22/title22sec2383-b.html)

The article argues, ""But placing a pill in a pocket does not involve repackaging, so the person would arguably commit unlawful possession while the drug is in his or her pocket."" It doesn't back this assumption up. 

 The only example it provides is for  someone who got in trouble for a single pill not in the original packaging.  But he had a prescription! An outdated prescription. So, he didn't actually have a valid scrip and having the original packaging wouldn't have changed that.  But your article glosses over that.

But I find it’s more of a long term strategy because the new thought patterns need to be engrained by repetition over time. I have had stressful jobs in the past where I’ve used CBT to try to talk myself out of the anxiety, but ultimately when I’m being bombarded with triggering situations daily, I just can’t keep up. My body is conditioned to react a certain way and it takes time to recondition that.

Don't be concerned - it's nothing debilitating, it's just going to be a little bit more of a struggle than you're used to as of recently. I'd try to take it as easy as you can and don't beat yourself up if you make more mistakes, are more forgetful, etc.

Insomnia

Mood Swings

Retarded Orgasm(Not as bad as it's sounds)

Heartburn (Only when i hadn't eaten before taking)

Apart from insomnia which was really bad (got better with diet changes) the others symptoms have gone after about 2 months.

The benefits are quite astounding (for people who understand what it's like)

I stopped biting my nails, been doing it for 20 years and then just stopped. I quit smoking (6 years). After dropping out of college 3 times in my teens I actually managed to go to evening school and will soon pass my electrical 3 year course with good grades.

"9892","Thanks for the decent reply :). US companies have definitely led the charge on ADHD medical research in all aspects, including medication. And I appreciate where you're coming from re: pricing having an impact on research &amp; investment. I'm certainly very happy to be a beneficiary of that research and investment too! 

That said, I still don't feel in reality (proportionally speaking), that the price folks pay for medication in the US  stacks up against the net benefit (in terms of future investment &amp; research) that higher cost generates.

All of that aside though, if you look at the situation and the absolutely devastating effect untreated adult ADHD has not only on an individual but also society as a whole (think productivity, health effects etc and associated flow ons of that), it's hard for me to agree. The fact the drugs which effectively treat ADHD are simply out of reach to so many Americans simply because they cost *so much* (while costing next to nothing to actually manufacture), is not only really upsetting on a base human level - it actually makes no sense from a strictly rational, economic perspective...  :/

I dunno, I don't live in America. But I'd like to think that there are better ways of driving innovation in medical research than simply charging patients more and more until only the comparatively lucky, elite can afford to receive treatment.

"9912","Hi! I ended up not starting the Zoloft when recommended to avoid dealing with side effects while I was super busy. After about two weeks off Prozac I felt SO much better! It felt like I was finally me again, and the clarity was insane. I decided to ride that out and see if it was just post-Prozac euphoria before starting anything else and ruining it, but surprisingly I felt good for a while.

I went back for monthly appointment and told my psychiatrist how well I was doing and voiced my apprehension about starting Zoloft when I felt like I didn’t truly need it at the moment. She agreed and told me I could continue taking just the Adderall and see how it goes. So I haven’t taken Zoloft yet! I’m still doing pretty well now although my anxiety has definitely come back a bit, but it’s nothing compared to what is was while on Prozac.

Doctors are skittish because it is Class 1 and state laws can make it impossible to transfer prescriptions across state lines. Physicians are way easier to schedule than psychiatrists but you need to ask them ""would you prescribe Adderall for adult ADHD"" and get a straight answer. I've been lied to by receptionists, and we had to pay for the appointment anyway. My own personal issue is anxiety, and I had one doctor tell me to ""suck it up"", refuse to prescribe anything, and went on to bill me $140 for the visit.

"9930","I think that I don't understand the idea behind your first paragraph. What I understand is the following:

We, (as persons), may on may not have goals, the problem is that as persons we grow tired of things. We tend to procrastinate, until there is something that force us to stop.

I have to understand that I'm a human, (with a brain that works slightly different), but as such If I can externalize my reward I'll have an easier time getting stuff done?

&gt; That person getting a degree? They procrastinated studying until they forced themselves into a study group. That language your buddy is learning? Well, there's a really hot girl in his class that he will never admit that in the back of his mind he is always trying to impress her. 

The problem that I see with your example is what if my buddy is learning a language on his own. He is using duolingo or some other tool and is making progress, why can't I do the same thing that he is doing?. Why is it so hard for me to force myself to study German every/day/week. Why can't I focus?.

Do I need a different environment in order to get the same things done?. I won't work until I get into a course and try to impress a lady that catch my eye. What will happen the day I don't find this lady in my class/job/life?. Will I fail miserable because I can't externalize my reward?.

And in the third paragraph I think that there is the answer. ""Then start small and grow in time"".

Don't force yourself to study German everyday if you haven't do so. Open the website and learn 2 words today. Do it, and once you do it feel proud of it for you can do it. Other people can study on their own for hours and that is good.

Is something they have been doing and growing to do for years. But just don't compare yourself to others. If other people can do X and Y, good for them. But feel proud if today you can enter to a website and learn 2 words in a different language, because yesterday you didn't do that, you didn't knew those words, and today you do, and grow higher in time.

The structures of amphetamine and meth amphetamine are different not only in orientation but also in substituents. 

They both affect dopamine but affect it in different ways and at different levels.

Methamphetamine has a higher binding affinity to your dopamine receptor so at similar doses, much more methamphetamine will enter your brain than amphetamine and can lead to a destruction of the nervous system whereas amphetamine will not.

Also, when people compare the two drugs they are comparing street made methamphetamine which are full of impurities that will affect you in other ways in which pure methamphetamine will not.

It made it tough to get assessed, because my psychiatrist kept saying, ""Well this is probably just your anxiety,"" but I kept saying I thought the anxiety was at least partially caused by inattention, and I finally got proven right when he let me try stimulants. I take an SSRI and concerta, and it's a tough balance, but I find the stimulants improve my anxiety in a lot of ways - saying fewer stupid things, remembering commitments, making fewer mistakes, and being more lucid in stimulating environments. I'm nervous about trying a higher dose because the stimulant could make me more anxious, so that's where I am right now. Tons of CBT, self-care, and meds, and it's an ongoing struggle. A big factor in helping my anxiety has been CBT and work with a therapist with my self-esteem, which isn't always addressed in Social Anxiety treatment. I really liked [this one.](http://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/resources/infopax.cfm?Info_ID=47)

"9978","I like to write a high level outline (just topics/ideas, not full sentences) and then I treat it like a puzzle, trying to rearrange them such that I can make connections between each of them.  Once I have the outline of topics and connectors then I zoom in and add details for each of the sections and connectors.  Also could be good to go back over and decide if any sentences should move to a different section once you’re done.","g7z2gdv",1,1602045302,"2020-10-07 04:35:02"
"9979","You can use the psychologytoday.com website or zocdoc.com, both have search functions where u can enter your location and insurance.  I'm in a major urban area which obviously helps there be a bigger pool.  If you are in an area where you still can't find practitioners, use these websites to find docs that do online sessions - more and more do.","e8ix70a",2,1540604750,"2018-10-27 01:45:50"

"9981","I remember sitting in college once, before I was diagnosed being completely fascinated by the people sitting there in the front row. 

The voice in my head: “How do they do that? How they just sit there completely still? No fidgeting, no nail biting, they don’t even seen to care that literally everyone is staring at the back of their heads right now. Amazing. And here I am, gnawing my nails to little stubs, leg bouncing up and down. I can’t even focus on what the professor is saying. What class am I even in now? Seriously, like statues...”

Professor: Uhtred, do you have the answer for exercise 34?

Me: Huh? Oh, right. Uh, yeah... It’s um... Hold on... I was just distracted for a second and uh... Is it C?

Professor: No, it’s $179.32 

Me: Oh, right! Yes, of course. I see. Just got uh... confused there for a second. I got it, thanks.","fafl8pp",1,1576025582,"2019-12-11 00:53:02"
"9982","Yeah, by realizing it, I was able to see when I was taking things too personally. Many times I came to realize after understanding different examples, that things were meant differently, not personally","dc0juzx",8,1483583054,"2017-01-05 02:24:14"
"9983","Yeah I'm a 24yo male and I cried when I first read a post that described what living with ADHD felt like. It was on /r/bestof so it totally took me off guard. Honestly the thought had never occurred to me that I had a disorder, but I believed that everyone was like me, they just handled it better than I did. If I'm being even more honest I thought ADHD wasn't real. I thought it was an excuse kids would be able to give their teachers and get pills from doctors. I was very wrong. So much about myself makes sense now. I'm glad that we have a such a good community on here to read of others experiences and help each other cope. ","cw6jazk",7,1445359627,"2015-10-20 16:47:07"

"9987","I always did decent in Tech School and High School because of lenient teachers and I learned how to take tests. It's pretty easy - every teacher puts in a deadwrong answer, a wrong answer, a best-guess answer, and the right answer; so I just played it off.

My High School also didn't require homework to be turned in and projects were all in-class work and I can type 100 wpm so I always had extra time (and learned how to use Wikipedia effectively for projects) 

My GPA was 3.6ish in Highschool and in College it kinda dipped down and I got a couple C's last semester just because A) I didn't understand what the teacher wanted in 1 and B) I didn't do any of the 'choose your own homework' papers in the other.

I guess my coping mechanism is just learning how to play the educational system game... but I have a tough time when it comes to application but that's where I truly,actually learn - and that's why I joined a club where there's no stress about grades or anything like that.","cufwnoi",1,1440561167,"2015-08-26 03:52:47"

"9992","What has worked for me in the past is switching to biphentin. I was on 40mg in the am and then a 10mg at 5pm and the 10mg boost at 5pmreally helped me stay calm the rest of the evening and finish off what Id need to do and go to bed. If you are fine with your meds as is id stillrecommend at least the 10mg biphentin in the evening. Being on a bit of medication for bed helps me sleep otherwise the rebound effect(basically what youre experiencing itseems) can last hours","d3s3e70",1,1464807839,"2016-06-01 19:03:59"
