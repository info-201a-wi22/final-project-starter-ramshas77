I'm going to save you some future headaches - read this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ax7zhb/i\_get\_really\_annoyed\_by\_the\_whole\_idea\_of\_adhd\_is\_a\_positive\_thing\_or\_adhd\_/eht0dkd/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ax7zhb/i_get_really_annoyed_by_the_whole_idea_of_adhd_is_a_positive_thing_or_adhd_/eht0dkd/?context=3) 

**Here is the hard-truth TL;DR:**

1. No one cares that you have ADHD but you
2. YOU are the person who has to live with it
3. You DO **NOT** REQUIRE other people's validation to have ADHD
4. People don't take it seriously and never will, *and that doesn't matter in the least!*

You can spend your whole life crusading against people's ignorance if you want, and sure, maybe you can change a few people's minds...but *why?*  So you can feel better about yourself?  So you can feel validated when you get their approval &amp; sympathy?  The reality is that you don't require anyone else's validation that you have ADHD; you simply *have* it, and *you* have to deal with it - other people aren't relevant to that story.  I'm not saying this to be mean, not at all - just as a wake-up call to a situation that pretty much everyone here has had to go through already.

My advice is to save yourself a lifetime of frustration by *stopping* telling people that you have ADHD &amp; *start* working on coping mechanisms that will enable you to deal with it at a functional level.  When I first got diagnosed, I spent a long time whining about my situation to other people too - people who didn't care &amp; didn't even think it was real, because exactly as you've found out, all they say is ""but *everyone* has ADHD, and *you're just lazy!*""  You &amp; I know that's not true, but as long as you keep giving people ammunition to throw at you, you're going to keep running into this situation.

**The bottom line is:**

1. It's not their problem
2. It's not your job to ""educate"" them
3. Your job is to work on your problems

Despite how obvious you feel your behavior is, no one has to know you have ADHD unless you tell them.  Other people with ADHD will be able to identify you (lol), but to everyone else, you're just a little scattered is all.  My recommend would be to switch from informing people about your ADHD to figuring out how you can get up to a functional level in all aspects of your life with it.  Having ADHD doesn't mean success is impossible; it simply means that you have to take a different route to success.

My suggestion would be to work on developing a personal productivity system (""PPS"") around how you operate, in order to allow you to be functional &amp; even successful.  My life was a mess for a long time, not out of maliciousness, but simply because I didn't understand how to appropriately handle my ADHD.  I dropped the ball on homework assignments, relationships, finances, my health, you name it...I had a *very* poor ability to follow-through on things, not because I was lazy, but because I literally *didn't know how*.  Neuro-typical people (i.e. ""normal"" people) sometimes fall of the wagon, but they can simply grit their teeth, push through it, and get caught up...that approach works zero percent for me, lol.  I *know* that's how things *normally* work, but that is not the reality that *I* live in, and I've had to adjust my habits &amp; environments to gear me up for success (I have suggestions on this if you're interested, btw).

Anyway...save yourself some grief &amp; decide to let it go.  Let go of telling people that you have ADHD, let go of caring about their opinion that ADHD is bogus &amp; that everyone has ADHD, and just focus on ways that you can improve your situation, now that you've been gifted with a clear explanation of what you've been struggling with.  It was such a revelation to me to learn that I had ADHD, because it cemented the fact that I wasn't lazy or undisciplined, I was simply struggling with a real problem - a goofed-up executive-function in my brain that made me kinda scattered &amp; kinda unfocused and made it hard to function normally.  Being told to ""just try harder"" is so annoying when you don't know *how* to escape your situation!

Anyway, welcome to the club!  I'd say we have jackets, but we forgot &amp; got sidetracked :D","ejopwl4",3,1553891227,"2019-03-29 20:27:07"

I won't lie, I've struggled a lot with maintaining habits, and still do. But honestly, I don't attribute that to the ADD as much as I do to being unable to accept that I'm different, or focusing too hard on how consistently I practice my resolved habits. 

I've found that habits are easier to enforce when I'm not too attached to them.

I think we're wired to constantly seek stimulus, so when we fail to hit that vein, things can get rough. 

In my most most successful or consistent habits, I've more or less embraced that I'll look like an utter weirdo to some people. That got easier to accept and deal with over time, so that now I'm not so bothered by it. It's not that I don't care what people think, it's just that I can't control how people see me. It sucks, but that's why I try to seek out and value people who accept me for who I am, even when I interrupt their serious conversation to inform them that I can turn my paper cup into a duck. 

(...Because that was important to get out, godamn it! I know we're talking about my bad childhood memories, but look! A godamn duck!)

Anyways. It's tough. We live in a society that is obsessed about reaching goals and so godamn nosey about -how- we achieve those goals, thinking there's only so many ways you can do things, and if you don't do it the way they think you should be doing it, well, here comes the side-eye or the lectures. If you resolve to embrace being kind of weird in the eyes of others, well, it helps. ","d9zmokh",2,1479116245,"2016-11-14 09:37:25"

"71","same. I need structure to function. I can only suggest-

Try and create a new structure. If you cant leave your house, find a specific room in your house and make it your 'classroom'. Only go in there for class, and between each class leave, for a bit, walk around, get a drink/ snack, then return, same as you would a normal school day. if you cant use another room, use a specific section of your room, say your desk. and do the same thing, set it up in the same manner you would for school. only the class books on the desk, pencil case, laptop etc. 

Close your door if you can, find big headphones, and blast your music in your headphones. tell yourself that this is your new routine, modify it until its something you like, and then tell yourself that this is the only way. Type it up, print it out and stick it on your wall, so you have a clear structure that you cannot break. But include specific times, make sure you have a cut-off time for doing school work, so for example, stop all school work at 8:30pm, anything that didnt get done, do the next day or whatever. 

i know it can be frustrating, and daunting, not having structure, but just bc you dont have structure now, doesnt mean you cant impliment it. It wont be the same as school, but think- what is it about the school structure that works so well? and then think about how you can modify it and impliment it at home, in a way that might work. and remember, it might take a bit of trial and error, and may take a while to get used to, but it is possible! good luck!","fl38ybs",1,1584773246,"2020-03-21 06:47:26"

"79","I'm quoting Wikipedia here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder

&gt;In 1775, Melchior Adam Weikard, a prominent German physician, published the textbook Der Philosophische Arzt. Weikard's text contained a description of ADHD-like behaviours, possibly the first ever such description in medical literature[3] Weikard described many of the symptoms now associated with the inattentive dimension of ADHD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. For instance, according to the English translation provided by Barkley and Peters, Weikard stated that:

&gt;""An inattentive person won’t remark anything but will be shallow everywhere. He studies his matters only superficially; his judgements are erroneous and he misconceives the worth of things because he does not spend enough time and patience to search a matter individually or by the piece with the adequate accuracy. Such people only hear half of everything; they memorize or inform only half of it or do it in a messy manner. According to a proverb they generally know a little bit of all and nothing of the whole....They are mostly reckless, often copious considering imprudent projects, but they are also most inconstant in execution. They treat everything in a light manner since they are not attentive enough to feel denigration or disadvantages.""

They didn't have a name for ADHD but ADHD symptoms were never considered normal and acceptable.

"86","I think that setting a timer is absolutely fundamental. A Pomodoro timer, egg timer, or watch timer whatever it is. 

One thing that I have learned about ADHD from Barkley and other research is that people with ADHD have a sort of 'time blindness.' Remembering the past, seeing the future, or even gauging passage of time we lack at. 

A few weeks ago I bought a Pebble Time smartwatch. I have mine set up to only forward certain notifications from my phone so that everytime my phone buzzes I don't have to check it. But honestly my favorite feature of this smartwatch is I have it set to buzz every half hour and I can set a timer on it for 15 or 25 or whatever minutes. 

Sometimes I'll set a timer to remind me to do something. Earlier tonight as I was leaving a friends house on the drive home I remembered that I wanted to check my grades in an online course. Knowing that I wouldn't just remember to do that when I got home, I set my timer for 12 minutes knowing that I had about 8 minutes to get home. So when my watch buzzed I looked at it for a sec thinking 'why is this buzzing now? why did I set a timer?' and then remembering the thing I wanted to do. I set short timers like this frequently throughout the day to remind myself to do something. 

Pebble Time smartwatches are pretty cheap now because a new generation just released. You can get them for 80-90$ at amazon or at Target. ","dahb99c",2,1480227892,"2016-11-27 06:24:52"

How do you make sure they’ll take you seriously? You can’t know that. What you can do is being specific about what you need from them.

The psychologist will most likely ask you why you made an appointment. Just tell them you want to be evaluated for ADHD. That you want to confirm your suspicions. 

I have found that diagnostic report the neurologist provided to me to be a very useful tool. Sure, it helped as I took it to my doctor to get medication. But what I found really valuable is that it highlighted the areas where I do well, and those where I struggle the most.

- been playing video games since 11yrs old, up to 8hrs/day minimum 1hrs/day. Very irregular though, and usually I switched games every 2-3 months, some games would return.
- I felt safe gaming, it felt more like going to a ""default"" mode. Indecissiveness, anxiety, lack of motivation to do things led to gaming.
- In the beginning, with friends, or when starting a new game, yes. Eventually, no. Games are designed to be fun, but were they that fun to me to commit so much time? No.
- yes, often.
- yes
- yes
- back then it helped me connect with friends outside school, in hindsight it may have prevented worse habits to evolve (drugs, criminality, or worse.. reading books). I would say it was a neutral activity (but standing still when the race has started is pretty much negative too).
- my parents and family chose that wording, but I did accept there was no other way to call it, even though I always 'felt' it was different.
- I use the term ""escapism"", because I tended to exhibit the same behavior with reading (fantasy) books, movie/tv series, even just my own fantasy.
- I still do, mostly when I smoke weed on my own (which is why I am only smoking socially from now on). I tend to fall back on this ""default"" mode, or ""escapism"" if I smoke weed continuously for a couple days or so. When sober, I rarely think about it (used to  be obsessed, particularily if it was new), now it occurs to me in free moments or high-stress moments (in ADHD, free time = high stress time), but I manage to choose better alternatives most of the time (taking a walk, sports, drawing, reading a book and on rare occasions actually doing what I need to be doing).","e4b8bjo",1,1534449055,"2018-08-16 19:50:55"

It should be ok to let them know you're ""suffering"" and that your lack of focus is hindering your abiities. etc can't put words in your mouth beyond general ideas. Shit when I was a kid, nurses did the vitals and check ins and Dr.s did the diagnosing and writing scripts. Now nurses do the scripts too, but they are so general, they don't want to take any risks and have not a clue about psychotropics beyond ""here have some prozac""","cjvchud",3,1408516669,"2014-08-20 06:37:49"

"119","hi sorry, i just saw this!

other than like, coffee, this is actually my first stimulant so i can't really compare to other meds i'm afraid. but it does actually kinda feel like coffee if you've ever experienced the appetite suppressant from that, except with vyvanse i don't feel as ""wired"" and the appetite suppression lasts until evening. 

i did not mention binge eating issues to my provider initially, as my main concern was ADHD treatment (and some people find ADHD meds increase their appetite, so i wasn't sure how it'd affect me anyway). however once i discovered how effective it was for my constant desire to eat, i mentioned the side effect to my provider and that i had always struggled with binge eating, and she seemed happy for me.

you might be able to bring up binge eating concerns as vyvanse is also prescribed for binge eating treatment! it's hard to say how any particular provider will react to that, but considering your binge eating is a genuine health concern it really might be worth trying for you. really stress to them that you've had long term BINGE eating struggles, not just occasional overeating. don't be afraid to go into detail, and don't give up if they initially brush you off, unfortunately some people have to try a lot to get the meds they need. if you have ADHD concerns definitely bring that up as well.

Then it’s usually about $550 for 45 minutes there after (rebate of about 250-280)  . I need this rebate because of regular weeks or fortnight visits will drain my wallet .

"150","I've definitely had that response too, if I try and look back on past relationships I really cannot imagine them, even if they were long and serious and even if I do remember some of it I can't actually remember or imagine what it felt like. Like I'm looking back on it like the same way I watch a movie, and it was a different me or something. 

I also wonder if I checked out and processed the end before the end even happened, if that makes sense? 

Also, if you were made to feel like you weren't doing enough and weren't given the space or opportunity to really be able to communicate or even understand your feelings then that can be pretty stressful to deal with. In one of my past relationships I felt like that and on reflection I think I then made myself and my feelings more and more invisible and distracted with other things and just checked out. So once I was out of the relationship I kind of just felt nothing or it was hard to go back and uncover all of that and process it because I did such a good job supressing it and maybe in some ways had already moved on.  

I also always wonder if some of it is like, oh I broke up I'm meant to be sad or something and then if I don't feel that it's really disjointing and confusing. But you don't have to be sad, you could feel any emotion, including not really feeling anything, so trying to figure out how I really feel in those situations, like maybe actually relief, and then acknowledging it and letting myself feel those things, then I find the feelings pass and I can move on better. And then other times it's like I can flip a switch like oh it's over and completely forget it ever happened.

Those of us with ADHD will probably always struggle in those environments. However there are some environments where quality &gt; quantity. The ability to take care of the mundane will always play some role, but there are different jobs out there and you can pick one that better suits your style.

Positive story: I'm a grad student in biology. I struggle to sit down and write or read papers.

"157","While I agree with what other people have said here about school being the place for asking questions, I understand how you feel with the almost compulsive need to ask them. I have a similar thing with asking for feedback from coworkers and teachers and I think it comes from that super awesome place of ADHD and anxiety meeting. Enough about my issues though. 

One trick I use to keep myself from asking for too much feedback is making a little game for myself. During one day, I'm only allowed to ask five feedback type questions. This gives me that little external reminder for when I'm going about the day to really think about whether or not I want to ""waste"" one of my five questions. Since I'm super competitive (and I bet you are too) this is enough to give me that small external reminder that I need to stop and truly consider whether I actually need to be asking my feedback question. 

You could try this with your questions in class. Again, it's really not about stopping you from asking questions, but about making you stop the ADHD brain train long enough to consider of the question really needs to be asked at that moment. If you ask five really important questions and then come up with another really important one, by all means, ask it. Just think first. Making it into a game will help with that thinking. :)","cqbju3n",2,1428977798,"2015-04-14 02:16:38"

"170","I wasn’t diagnosed until a few weeks ago at 25 and felt exactly like you when I was a senior in college. Depressed, lost, overwhelmed by the idea of graduating and moving on. Everyone around me had internships and job interviews or were applying to grad school. I felt like an adult baby in comparison. It wasn’t until I graduated and learned I had ADHD that I understood why I felt this way. Knowing you have ADHD now is actually a huge plus for you because you understand yourself better than I ever did. 

You know what else I realized? Having a plan isn’t always the answer. Having things lined up isn’t always the right way or the easy way to navigate life. No detailed vision for your future? No problem. 

Chip away at college a bit at a time. Focus on doing well in your classes and balancing college life in the short term. Take care of your health. Then, think about what you want to do within the next year. Internship? Job? New apartment? What small steps can you take to chip away at that long term goal? Once you take that step you’ll realize it isn’t always as overwhelming as it seems to think about the future.

And just a reminder, ADHD isn’t a death sentence. You are not your ADHD. You are a whole, capable person who has to deal with problems caused by ADHD. These are speed bumps, not road blocks. Listen to your therapist on this one and don’t beat yourself up so much, you’re doing fine.","g2tyygt",2,1598382904,"2020-08-25 19:15:04"

I don't necessarily want to sit down and try to work, because I'm afraid I'll fail regardless of how hard I try. I worry that I'm not good enough because I'm not doing enough, since society greatly values output. This is ridiculously counterproductive. It's significantly harder to get stuff done if you beat yourself up after every step that hasn't gone perfectly.

I kind of chalk it up to how it exhausting it feels to focus. Normally I just try to keep my momentum going after I'm off work - I don't relax until I've felt like I've gotten through what I've planned. I'm not sure if this the most healthy because it also leads to me putting off dinner and sometimes eating in general, but I find as soon as I sit down at the end of my day, it is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to get back up again.

In terms of remembering your meds at work, I generally carry several/keep bottles of my meds in various places so I'm never without. The trick is to then refill those when you run out, which is a whole other thing 🤣. I've also tried to use those weekly pill reminder containers, but again it comes down to making sure you remember to refill. I tend to use my calendar &amp; constant reminders for that stuff until it becomes routine and I don't have to keep bugging myself.

"192","Yeah ! I feel you on the second part of your post. I feel like I empathise a lot. I just got out of a three years long relationship and started to meet new people and go on dates and shit. I feel like I empathise a lot. I always try to be connected with the person as  much as posisble. Of course I don't force it, if I don't feel attracted to the person I won't force the connection. But When I feel it, when we both have a good feeling it's like we're really connected. And I feel like I have always found the date as memorable and outstanding as possible. As someone with ADHD, I've always lived very passionate and long relationships. It was really bursting with feelings, and I have always be extremely dedicated in my relationships. I put a lot of myself in it (dates or relationships) sometimes for the good, sometimes for the bad. I can easily suffer over love, but yeah.

And don't worry OP ! It's you don't connect, it's not because of you. Sometimes you find people that don't really suit you and you can't force it. The person have to be into you as well. So don't worry about that ! ","ed11vhg",1,1546370918,"2019-01-01 19:28:38"

"202","Yep. The moment you approach something from the position of “you’re wrong”, even with good intentions, you put the other person on the defensive. Simply adding information from a neutral perspective avoids that. If presented from a position of you and the other person being on the same team with the main goal of becoming more informed about things, then they’re more open to hearing new information. And that’s the best way for one to change their mind because changing your mind is typically a personal thing that comes with time and new information and rarely is it ever due to another person persuading them through argument and debate. 

This applies to a lot of things in life. Nobody wants to be wrong about something and egoic defenses are powerful, so the best way to educate others is to find ways to provide them with information in ways that don’t bring their guard up and in ways that sneak past their autopilot responses. That’s how it has to be in a world where double standards, tribalism, and all sorts of cognitive biases exist and for a reason. It’s not about assuming that everybody is 100% rational and then approaching with a 100% rational argument. It’s about acknowledging the way people think and finding ways around that. Which isn’t exactly common knowledge unless you’re really into things like psychology, marketing/persuasion, etc. 

For example, when talking about ADHD with someone I know that I feel I owe an explanation to, I don’t start with the term ADHD and I don’t mention the poor focus/attention aspects (which everybody can relate to these days). Rather, I describe a deficit in executive functioning, outline particular symptoms, and state that it could potentially be partially due to a deficit of dopamine and norepinephrine in certain parts of the brain. If the person is a gamer, I just say it’s like in the Sims when you click to do certain things but your Sim simply doesn’t listen. Or that it’s like playing a game with unresponsive controls and a lot of lag. For depression, rather than use terms like “sad” or “feeling the blues” which are normal feelings that everybody experiences, it’s more about emphasizing the overall numbness, the inability to conceptualize the future (“fog of war” if talking to a Starcraft fan), the struggle to do even the most basic things like get out of bed to go to the washroom, the learned helplessness of the whole thing.

"210","I made a top level comment about what I'm doing, but what you're saying sounds similar to how I was before. One of the most important things I do is a list that I call my bible. If I forget everything I'm supposed to do, completely fall off the bandwagon for days, this list has everything I need to remember about what I'm supposed to do. All my coping mechanisms and the thing I want to think or change are in there. The order that I do things in and the time when I do things is in the note. And I cling to that note, I read it when I'm awake enough to read it (after I shower) and I read it in my car when I'm leaving work. Everything I'm supposed to do, even that I'm supposed to check my reminders before I leave for work, and as soon as I get home. All my expectations for my self are very clear and written in the note, so I know if I suceseded or failed. And I'm constant improving the note to handle my life better and to make things in a way that I'll do them (I have recurring reminders, and I have a time that I'm supposed to check them every day, instead of a line in the note that says ""do X three times a week"") Everything is a daily success or failure. I did all the reminders that showed up for today or not. Remembering things for more than one day is not reliable for me, so I've worked on my note and my expectations so that remembering something across days is not necessary. A good example is I have second note that I also read after work. The Bible note says I have to update this note at night and I have to read it after work. It will say things like ""stop by the store for X on the way home"" plus a few extra things to get me in the right mindset again. I can't forget to stop by the store after work tomorrow, because I'm not even expected to. Im just expected to follow along with my bible note all day, while I'm leaving work I see ""read the leaving work note"" and then I see what I left the night before.","dnlw24u",1,1506562033,"2017-09-28 01:27:13"

He was asking a fair question. OP wasn't happy with being questioned, and starts filling in with his interpretation of how he was behaving. That's all this is. The doctor did exactly what he was supposed to. It's not supposed to be roll up to a doctor and demand pills. They need to diagnose and make an informed decision based on their own evaluation.  This is universal. If you go to a new doctor, they will always do an evaluation, regardless of previous diagnosis by other doctors, and regardless of specialty. This is how medicine works. And the doctor got answers from OP that seemed to show no need for medication, and asked him to further explain why he felt he needed medication. The more I think about this story, the more sympathetic I am to the doctor. ADHD is not an easy diagnosis to make, OP did well on the tests, and only through pushing OP to explain his story fully could he make the diagnosis.

"255","I'm so sorry you are struggling.

First, I would schedule an appointment with a qualified mental health professional to get screened for ADHD / ADD. Be sure they have experience diagnosing adults. This needs to happen before you can be consistently prescribed medication. I would not blackmail your doctor into prescribing Adderall as suggested. I do not want you to get blacklisted for putting your doctor in that position / drug seeking. If you have a history of drug abuse (depending on the extent and your drug of choice), a non-stimulant medication may suit you better. Try to think about this in terms of addressing your ADHD rather than what you know to feel effective.

Second, turn your script in. It can take a long time to find a medication that works for you. Don't give up. Keep seeing your therapist. Take steps to modify your behavior and hold yourself accountable (that's what I'm doing right now). Medication helps, but is not a cure.

"288","Newser keeps having errors so I can't comment on the story, but here's my would-be response: 

*I think people should keep these facts (not my opinions) in mind: 
- Anti-psychotics aren't typically used to treat ADHD. Stimulants are still widely regarded as the best medical choice, and they can cause weight loss, not gain. They do not increase diabetes risk, but they do slightly elevate one's risk of developing high blood pressure, so people on them are monitored every 6 months. 

- 81% of people with untreated ADHD will develop one or more serious mental illnesses in adulthood. Treated individuals only have a 10% chance, which is only slightly higher than the general population. One should keep in mind that not all serious mental illnesses, such as depression, are lifelong. The depression that is associated with ADHD tends to be chronic. 

- In animal studies, mice developed symptoms of ADD and ADHD when they had their dopamine levels lowered. Furthermore, people who had damage to parts of their brain (usually incurred by hypoxia at birth, though some TBIs, chemotherapy and potentially longterm marijuana use can cause it as well) that are known to produce dopamine oftentimes develop symptoms of ADD/ADHD. Brain scans of children and adults with ADHD showed decreased activity in the parts of the brain responsible for synthesizing dopamine. This all strongly suggests that ADHD is, when properly diagnosed, a chemical dopamine deficiency which one day may be able to be diagnosed with scans/lab tests instead of symptom questionnaires, which are notoriously less accurate. The FDA is already testing brain scans for ADHD, and the NHS already covers brain scans to diagnose ADHD in some circumstances.
 
- During fetal development, the parts of the brain responsible for synthesizing dopamine are quite fragile. The rise in premature babies surviving, multiple births, induction before 40 weeks gestation, chemicals in the environment, and older parents have all been implicated in the rise of learning disorders. Also, back in the day, people with these disorders were simply written off as stupid, lazy, or crazy.*

"334","This is actually a accurate way to describe the effect on me too. I wonder if it was the age I started taking Vyvanse or the medication itself that created that perception of being an adult to myself and others. Maybe a little of both. When I first met one of my good friends a few years ago she said ""okay, dad..."" followed almost immediately by ""you're such a little kid"". I had just started my medication at that point. In retrospect, I had the tendency to be very serious, likely as a way to counteract my perceived childishness. 

I'm still childish to a degree but I have more control. It's not necessarily negative either; instead of being super clumsy, unable to speak to people coherently, do things on my own, etc, it's more that my excitement for stuff is focused on a particular thing. I was told ""I love how excited you are, it's so sweet"" on Monday by a classmate. 

I generally wouldn't write all this all out but I had to take Adderall for the last few months due to issues with patient assistance and it just can't compare. Adderall did just about the opposite for me. The only benefit is that it gives the potential for focus but Vyvanse seems to actually get at the problem without major side-effects. 

I guess ultimately I enjoy my ""childishness"" but I don't enjoy acting like a child. I think that is probably what it means to be an adult. ","cltgu8q",3,1415169565,"2014-11-05 06:39:25"

"342","No, maximum effectiveness is reached at 3-5 hours. You're virtually there at 2 hours, but not entirely. Comedown side effects, which often don't even exist on Vyvanse, shouldn't be happening till c. 12 hours in, give or take an hour or two depending on your system. Since it lasts so long most people would have a lot of trouble sleeping taking it after 10 am.

Vyvanse and Strattera both affect norepinephrine, the probable cause of your panic attacks and circulatory troubles, so it's the combination of the two effectiveness curves that you should be thinking about. Strattera's tricky and complex, but there's probably still a peak point of norepinephrine effect each day even if it isn't noticable.

Try the next Vyvanse dose down, 20 mg. And failing that the 10 mg, if that's available. You're using these as adjuncts so the normal dosing rules are out the window.

What do you mean about avoiding other stimulants when you first feel panicky? Have you been mixing something else in with Strattera and Vyvanse (!!!) at other times? Caffeine will be absolutely haywire with that combo. I get anxiety, irritability, racing heart etc. a couple hours after imbibing even a bit of it when on Vyvanse, and those effects last quite a while.

Note, too, that because of its long half-life Vyvanse should be taken every day or you'll never have the slightest idea how much is in your system. Steady state is reached after a few days, so don't worry if 20 mg seems underpowered at first. If it still doesn't help you one week in or if you're still experiencing significant anxiety then Vyvanse probably isn't for you. Well, it might be worth trying the 10 mg out if you have effectiveness but still some anxiety. Some people have less anxiety with Adderall than with Vyvanse, counterintuitively, so don't assume the stimulants are out for you as a class.

I think citrus is supposed to slow the effects down (lessen them, but make them last longer), but that this is less of a concern with Vyvanse than other stimulants because the citric acid will only interact with the amphetamine that's already been split from the lysine - or something. But that's just what I've heard, and probably misremembered. I haven't noticed anything either way, but I don't drink much juice.","cwmxy8z",1,1446565215,"2015-11-03 15:40:15"
"343","I'm in a similar situation right now so I'm certainly not a success story yet but I hope I will be soon. My problem is that I'm really good at school but not real life. I feel I went undiagnosed through childhood, high school, and college because I never needed to study and I'm really really good at taking tests. I got really good grades with minimal effort. Unfortunately, once you graduate from college there are no more tests. You have to go to work all day every day rather than only having to be somewhere for a couple hours per day. I could never concentrate or focus in classes but I got away with it because I could do homework really quickly and tests were always really easy for me. 

Now that I'm 25 I feel like a total failure. My apartment is ""acceptable"" but not nearly as clean and organized as I would like it and that totally stresses me out but obviously I have no motivation to do it. I'm putting in the absolute minimum at my job and I'm miserable because I know I can do so much more and I can be really good at it but don't have the energy. I get obsessed with new hobbies and then leave them for something else in a couple days. Like buying a $500 camera two years ago and still having no idea how to use it (well).

Well last week I was on [r/depression](http://reddit.com/r/depression) and someone posted about how their main symptom was inability to focus and get motivated. Someone commented that they thought they may have ADHD. So I checked out ADHD and a lightbulb went off. I have ADHD.

"363","This is normal, especially for inattentive type ADHD.

I was going to only mention what my therapist had suggested for me during times of extreme anxiety, which would be riding out the feelings as if you’re riding on a wave, and the crest of the wave is your highest point of uncomfortable feelings and thoughts, and then your mind and body will move on, and you’ll see that you’re ok and can get through it. This can REALLY help, however there are other things you can try, based on your dissociation.

I sometimes dissociate too, but mostly when I’m in social situations. What helps me then is to find something to keep me grounded, like subtlety counting all of the things in the room that are the color blue, for example. It helps my mind stay sharper than if I just zoned out, and it keeps intrusive anxiety-thoughts at bay because I’m actively focused on something there in front of me. 

Side note: this doesn’t go as well when you’re being talked to directly, as of course the other person can tell if you’re looking around the room.
Holding something tangible in your hand helps for this- and mentally noting what you notice and feel about that object- like a warm cup of coffee, which smells good. 

Trying these things at home can help, since part of what you’re experiencing could be a lack of stimuli for your mind/brain. 

I wish you luck! It’s scary, but you’ll get through it and when you recognize it as something benign that isn’t going to hurt you; and you will likely have less intense episodes of this and they will be fewer and far between.","gph8bs7",2,1614730967,"2021-03-03 00:22:47"

"374","Guilt and shame over our lifelong patterns is a hallmark of many adults with ADHD who slipped through the cracks as children (I was diagnosed at 36 with ADHD &amp; comorbid bipolar II &amp; Avoidant Personality Disorder) while other peers who had more severe symptoms at a young age were medicated and taught coping mechanisms. So in adulthood, the lack of awareness of the condition, the lack of any learned coping mechanisms/external structure &amp; people's judgements (both real &amp; perceived) that you just aren't trying hard enough or are an asshole all build up to feeling crippling guilt &amp; shame. The lucky ADHDers by comparison were the ones that got noticed at a young age and have had years &amp; years to work on their symptoms, without developing deep-seeded adult ADHD behaviors in a completely unaware fashion.

It's ok. 

ADHD is not a failure to mature.
ADHD is not a moral failing.
ADHD is not a weakness of character.
ADHD is a neurophysiological condition with roots in inherited genetic characteristics and a lot of developmental/environmental glitches.

Don't feel guilty &amp; fuck the psychiatrist if they don't understand that merely accusing you of abusing the Adderall is detrimental to your depression and associated feelings. Really that sounds like a terrible  clinician with little empathy who you need to never see again. Surround yourself with supportive people and be where you feel appreciated.

It discusses just what it is, how it affects people who have it, how to treat it, and the consequences of *not* treating it. [Understood](https://understood.org) is also excellent and is targeted at parents of kids with ADHD and other disorders.

No, there are no ""natural"" treatments for ADHD. There are no supplements, herbs, or forms of alternative medicine that have any efficacy in treating ADHD.

Whether medication is a good option varies from person to person, but by and large it is the most effective treatment available for ADHD. Medication's role isn't to make those who use it efficient worker bee robots, it's to improve their quality of life and reduce the impact of their impairments. It's basically a prosthetic. Just like many people need prosthetic limbs or wheelchairs or glasses or pacemakers to mitigate their various injuries or impairments and live their best life, *we* need medication, coping mechanisms, and external prosthetic tools and systems (like whiteboards, calendars, and organization and planning systems) to live *our* best lives.

ADHD is only controversial in those who aren't experts on it. It's actually one of the *most*-studied mental disorders and there is a ton of science on it. Stick with the actual experts who have built the authoritative knowledgebase on it.","f3dxsdk",1,1570850276,"2019-10-12 03:17:56"

"415","Hi,

Do you usually experience sleeping problems, when under the effects of stimulants? If that should be the case, there are plenty of ways to fix that. You can lower the evening dose etc. Start the intake a bit early etc. or switching medications. However it is not unusual to have some sleeping problems at some time with or without the condition. So if this is the first singular incident i wouldn't stress it to much. Also keep in mind while sick, it is normal to feel more tired and therefore keep to a better sleep schedule. Its the bodys way of aiding recovery. So being sick should never be the ""control group"" for sleeping patterns. If this continues id confer with your doctor. As mentioned above: There are plenty of ways to eliviate sleeping problems.

TL;DR: Happens to the best of us. If it continues talk to your doctor. Other than that: Keep trying sometimes you get crappy sleep sometimes it gets better.

There is also some variation in ADHD. There's a new upcoming diagnosis called Sluggish Cognitive Tempo which may or may not be related to ADD; it doesn't respond as well to meds and might suit your symptoms more. There's a subreddit for it /sct. 

I know how you feel, though. I feel like I have something different from a lot of people; not just because of my lack of responsiveness to medication, but I feel much less capable compared to others even without the medication. I have other diagnoses too, but I feel like attention/motivation is its own thing in my case. I have bipolar ii / depression. I can tell when I'm depressed, though, and it obviously has an impact on my motivation. But even when I feel good, I still have motivation / follow through problems.

Therapy so far hasn't been helpful with the ADD domain. 

And never think about ""will power"" again. It's a function of the brain and you can't will yourself to have it. Instead, think of structuring your environment (work, family, home, school) to be more supportive. 

But, frankly, I've really struggled with it. I haven't gotten very far. You're not alone. ","c6i243l",3,1349452204,"2012-10-05 15:50:04"
"436","We know ADHD has

* **Multiple causes** and one person's cause may not be the same as another person cause.  With person 1) they may have ADHD genes A, B, D, and E while with person 2) they may have a different combination of genes while with person 3) there may be environmental factors such as internal bleeding that caused the adhd.  There is no one single ADHD gene, but you have to have several ""adhd risk genes"" and the combination increases your chances of being ADHD.

* **That one person's ADHD can look very differently than another person's ADHD.** One person may be very hyperactive and do things such as being loud, climbing on tables and full of energy.  Another one may be tired and always spaced out and daydreaming.  A third may look different depending on the environment.  A fourth may show lots of impulsivity symptoms and is just generally unpredictable and does not think things through.

Well in the 80s and 90s we were hoping to classify people ADHD based on the external manifestations that this person was hyper and this one was not.  We thought by grouping these people together with all the hyper people in one group we would be better at finding out the genetic and enviromental causes of their ADHD.

Well turned out that was foolish, that two people whose ADHD look completely differently on the outside may have very similar inside traits like genetics.  One brother may be hyper, but another may be a quiet wallflower artist but both are ADHD.   So we found out external stuff does not predict anything.

Second the treatments for ADHD are the same whether the person is hyper or inattentive and daydreamy.  They respond to the same type of medicines and while no ADHD person responds to all ADHD medicines, with a success rate up to  66% for each individiual medicines if you try multiple medicines the rate goes to above 90% and the outwardly traits do not suggest anything on which medicine works best, it is trial and error.  (Genetic studies in the last 5 years though suggest genetics may determine your drug response but we are not ready to use this info in clinical practice).

* Lastly and this is very important.  Like a non ADHD 5 year old self is not like his 15 year old self not like his 25 year old self.  An ADHD person's 5 year old ADHD traits may not be like his 15 year old ADHD traits and his 25 year old ADHD traits.  What happens is due to normal brain development and the structure of the enviroment you may see changes in the person and their manifestations.  5 year old climb on tables, 25 year old are often less hyper, and if they are hyper it becomes an internal need to be busy.

[Wikipedia has a good article on the last point.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder)

Because of all this the DSM V which came out in 2013 (the previous version came out in 2000) removed the ADHD subtypes said there are no subtypes but there are presentations where if you were to watch a kid or adult for a single day you may say he presents these symptoms but those presentations have no predictive power.  It is merely a communication tool of what things they have difficultly with.

Here is a good video explaining this. [Video occured in 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3d1SwUXMc0&amp;t=733)","cpc0ev9",21,1426118275,"2015-03-11 23:57:55"

"439","Hello. I've ADHD as well. What I'm going to share is my perspective. It helps me. It might help you, as well.

TL;DR - Please read the bold lines.

**There's a kind of loneliness that accompanies ADHD that can't be rebuffed by people or things. Today it is Reddit; tomorrow, it might be something else.**

I code for a living, and I like what I do. I think my ADHD partners well with my work. A lot of the time, I continuously need to switch my focus from one tab to the other. So it goes with the flow of my ADHD impulses. That said, things are not always easy.

To counteract the loneliness, I partner my work with making video tutorials. In these tutorials, I try to teach what I've learned from my work. And it helps with *that* loneliness, which drives me to make impulsive decisions or visit Reddit more often than usual or overeat etc.

Tutorials help me in such a manner because the process is simulating a conversation with a person. In the videos, I'm talking to a screen. Also, keep in mind that I'm talking about something important to me. So, I'm able to immerse myself in the process thoroughly. And when I'm engaged in such a manner, I don't feel lonely, for those moments.

*The loneliness never goes away. As I indulge in making my video tutorials (something that helps me deal with the loneliness), it is just a productive way of numbing it.* I'm surrounded by people who trust me and support me in all the ways I want. But I still feel that loneliness.

To give you an additional perspective, I cycle two times a day - 40 minutes each session. I take my medicine two times a day, and I use Progressive Muscle Relaxation to deal with my ADHD anxiety. I maintain regular contact with my friends. Things are healthy, and it is what I had intended. My diet is minimalist too. After all of this, I still feel the loneliness.

**I've read three books on ADHD**, and I read them way before my diagnosis.  **In one of the books, the authors talked about a 'Creative Itch' that accompanies a lot of people who suffer through ADHD. This loneliness seems like that 'Creative Itch.'**

**The point is that you need to find something that helps you deal with that Loneliness/Creative Itch. People and things (distractions?) might not be enough. For me, it is making video tutorials.**","fhagtnl",1,1581409872,"2020-02-11 08:31:12"

I had previously always assumed mods and helpers need to be a bit flexible in terms of unsolicited DMs - the situation is different I think for mods.

We do prefer in general to have mod discussions on the server (in the modtalk channel) mostly so that we have a record that all mods can access at any time, as well as for accountability (our own).

"454","A problem I know too well. Honestly, you gotta find the technique that works for you. My younger kids are all over the place and I'm lucky that I have a shallow pool where they can always touch the ground. I can watch them if they swim away and run to them if they're in trouble. It gives me lots of time to teach the other kids in the class.

You might want to try keeping them active for the entire lesson. A moving child is a listening child. Find fun games to keep them active or change your swimming formation to shorten time on the side. If I have four kids in a class, I'm making two swim towards me at a time. When they're swimming back, I send the other two.

If your kids are young enough, try theming the lessons. If my students are 7 or younger, I might do a space theme, or say we're going to the zoo. Connect the swims as you go, for example, front glides can be called ""rocketships"" and front swim could be a ""moonwalk"". Extemporaneity is key so be sure to have a vague idea of what you want to accomplish. I once taught an entire session to a student narrating Planet Earth as he pretended to be the different animals. If pretending doesn't work for older kids, try games with aims.

The most important thing is to remember that they're all kids. I'm always sensitive to my student's learning disabilities but I never make their diagnosis how I perceive them, and while I'm going to adjust my lessons and tone between kids that have ADHD, Autism, or no diagnosed learning disability, I have to treat them like everyone else, because what kid wants to feel different? Just have lots of reminders and even more patience. If you set consequences, follow through. Idk how comfortable you are with getting help from your supervisors but if you can, it can really ease the burden of lessons.

I wasn’t diagnosed until 40, but things I wish people knew or understood:

- what seems super obvious to someone usually doesn’t to me. For example, cleaning my room is so hard even as an adult. I often get overwhelmed when many things need to happen and then I freeze up and don’t know where to start. Easier for me to tackle one specific thing at a time. First, throw away all trash. Second, pick up clothes and put in baskets. Third, take all cups down to the kitchen. (Something like that)

- I need LOTS of reminders. I’ve learned to rely on my phone for alarms, calendars, etc. He may need visual reminders on a chart. 

- ADHD is exhausting. What might seem lazy is really just me protecting what little mental energy I have left. Some days I just have to zone out bc I have nothing left. 

My 8yo was recently diagnosed so I’m making an effort to help him learn better strategies now. Lists and pictures and ROUTINE. I try to keep his routine the exact same M-F. Not overly scheduled but if it’s the same few simple tasks it is easier to keep up with. 

I no longer expect him to sit and eat with us. Haha. He can’t do it and it used to drive me crazy. Now I let him walk around during dinner. He’ll sit and eat a few bites and then get up. Then he’ll come back, same thing. 🤷🏼‍♀️

If I walk into his room and see an absolute disaster I try very hard not to use language that might embarrass him. Just say something matter of fact like, Looks like you’ve been busy! Let me help you get things out away before dinner (or whatever)

It’s hard - even as an adult with ADHD I can get exasperated at my son. But the more accepting you are, especially TO him, the better. ADHD can bring so many feelings of shame as you begin to realize how very different you are. He just needs to know he’s got a safe place with you ❤️","fikn04n",1,1582483418,"2020-02-23 18:43:38"

"469","TL;DR You have a right not to tell anyone, but you can if you want; ignorant people might judge you, though.

My philosophy is that humans should always be able to be as open as they want to be, without fear of judgement. It's hard to accomplish this outside of the Bay Area. Unfortunately, people tend to always find something to ""judge"" you on, or to use against somehow. Perhaps that's just human nature.

My own sister (who is likely a narcissist) has been unsupportive of me getting medication, among other things.  I suspect other relatives, excluding my mother, might be that way. My redneck grandmother seemed to be critical of me getting put on zoloft when I was a little kid for depression. But you know what? Fuck 'em. It's my life, my body, my choice. Last time I checked, America is a free country. There's nothing anyone can do about it besides whine and judge. The sad thing is that most of it stems from ignorance.

Legally, you have a right to not tell anyone about your medical business. Don't worry about telling your employers about it, because if you do, and they fire you, you could sue them for discrimination.

"479","I honestly don't think the test they made you do is standard operating procedure for diagnosing ADHD. The standard requires five symptoms out of 9 in the DSM V. I haven't seen any research that has shown these tests to be accurate.

The only proven way to diagnosis adult ADHD accurately is interviewing you and if possible a close friend / family member. This provides for a second party to corroborate your issues and more importantly others notice your issues a lot better then you normally would.

But those tests have never been proven to reliably diagnose adhd. The problem is new or novel tasks often cause people with adhd to hyper focus. Combine this with intelligence or lack there of is not a symptom of adhd. 

It's one of the reason women are so under diagnosed. You can always put more and more hours into your studies to compensate for your handicap. You can always try harder and harder to compensate for your issues. But it doesn't change the fact you struggle daily .","dsxim60",3,1516385986,"2018-01-19 18:19:46"

Must have a current note from primary care provider validating stable status of condition with summary of diagnosis, history of treatment and ruling out any residual of ADD/ADHD

Must be off medication for a minimum of two years

Show evidence of successful academic and work endeavors while off medication

Show evidence that assignments or tests were not taken with classroom aids such as private study area, special tutors or additional time for completion”

"516","This all sounds freakishly like me, just like OP his story, only when it comes to adrenaline me and OP seem different. I did lose my driving license a few times for speeding and the only sports I enjoy are things like skiing and skating. I'm not an adrenaline junkie but if there's a chance I try to grab it.

All else I have the same as you and OP, I'm now awake for 24h and probably will be a few more, could be I sleep 6h or 14h when I fall asleep, it all depends. My sleep is really irregular, I don't have a day/night rhythm. I tend to go to bed when I'm really exhausted else my brain just keeps thinking about all kinds of stuff.

Last week I went with my dog to the veterinarian and at the end of the consult she says he needs to take some meds (some supplements so he has nothing serious). While she was explaining to me about how much and how long I need to give them I started to daydream, I came back when I heard ""I think he's a bit more as 20kg right?"". I immediately replied with ""yes he's around 20kg, probably 22kg"". But I had no idea what she said before, these things really confuse me sometimes. People don't notice it because I tend to give normal replies when a reply is needed and I don't have to ask what she said in such a situation I'll just look that up myself. But it's not the first time this happens, I just lose my concentration in a conversation. Not all the time, but it happens regularly.

Other things I have is that I never in my life finished anything, I start with lots of enthusiasm, can spend hours on it for a few days and then I'm bored and I quiet. I just can't finish it, how hard I want it or try it, it just doesn't work. I just start to do something else, which obviously ends the same.   

I never thought about ADHD since I'm a really calm person, if I would tell anyone that I think I have ADHD, they probably would start laughing. I'm 30 now, didn't pass uni but passed my high school really easy, never really studied a lot but I always scored enough to pass. Since then I constantly job hop, everything is nice at the beginning but it gets boring after a few weeks. And I tend to go from one of the best employees to one of the worst in record time. 

Could this be ADHD? Or is what I have something else? I know I'm not like the average person and it starts to hinder me. Reading more and more about it ADHD seems to fit, except that I'm not restless physically, I'm actually more the opposite.

Energy drinks don't work like they should on me either, once used amphetamine 10 years ago and even that didn't work like it should. Smoked some weed, than my friend offered me some speed and I agreed to try it once because I was curious about it and I could use some help in keeping me awake so I took a tiny bit... I fell asleep 1h later. My friend never had seen something like that, his conclusion was I smoked too much weed. Which was also the case at that time so I never looked it up till now.

"535","You'll probably reject this suggestion, but I'll make it anyway.

Consider a motorbike licence first. *Hear me out a moment...*

Got bike licence at 18, had bike most of the time since, never yet ridden medicated (diagnosed last month). Got car licence around 25 - wasn't interested, but mum nagged, and guilt tripped me regularly. She ended up offering to pay lessons and test. I gave in for a quiet life. Didn't have a car until around 5 years later.

A car is a mobile sofa on wheels, comfy seat, aircon, sound system, toys, mirror to shave or do your makeup, cup holders for the coffee or coke, etc. They *actively* encourage you to relax and distract.

If you relax to the same extent on a bike you'll fall off. You will fall off at some point. Probably at very low speed. You'll discover some things. Roads are hard and hurt. Changing road conditions with weather and seasons - when there's grip and when there's very little etc. You will *feel* when it's near freezing or a warm or cold front passes. You'll realise nearly ALL drivers are bloody awful, not concentrating and barely awake. That all a flashing indicator tells you is the bulb works.

Don't know US bike licensing, but in Europe you start with some off road training to stay upright etc. Plenty of chance to get to know the thing before you go near a road, and worries from fear of driving might kick in.

**TL;DR** To an unmedicated ADHD brain (mine), the bike was the only relaxation I could get, as it was the only time my mind ever shut up for years. I had to concentrate, I had to focus, and when the alternative is your ass on the hard road, it just happens. 30 minutes of peace, and all that's in my head was riding and the road.

Added bonus, they're a HUGE amount of fun and cheaper to run than cars. ~~Girls like bikes too.~~ Last bonus, it's proven to make you a much better driver - you'll notice a lot more stuff, distract less, and still do bike safety observations.","d8rq0xm",2,1476453284,"2016-10-14 13:54:44"

"549","As a full-time teacher who's dealing with his own ADHD I'd say:
A combination of structure, consistency and autonomy is , in my opinion, the best way to help your child.

Structure : This will help her to focus on one thing at a time. Which, honestly, is hard enough already. A daily routine or weekly schedule helps to get trough the week. You can even work on it together if you want too. 

Consistency : Rules are rules even for children with ADHD so stick to them. If she breaks one of them. Remind her what the rules were and ask her to stop doing that in a calm and peaceful way. Don't raise your voice or get angry. I know this can be very difficult but this will only trigger her more. 

Autonomy : A feeling of being able to make her own decisions will give her confidence in the things that she does on the daily basis. As a parent, you can help her to make the right decision. For example, when she is making a lot of noise you can tell her : You have 2 choices : Or make less noise and play some more or stop playing and go to bed. Furthermore, praising her when she made the right decision will help her to recognize the right one herself. 

I hope I have been of help.

"553","&gt; Strattera is a long-acting norepinephrine (i.e. noradrenaline in the central nervous system) reuptake inhibitor. So yes, the ""daily effect"" or like ""daily boost"" lasts a few hours, but over time as the medication (and the norepinephrine) builds up in your system, you will continue to have a steady state change from the ADHD state to the ADHD on strattera state. 

&gt; My experiences (I was on strattera for like 8 months? and about 5-6 on the final dose I ended up taking?) were that strattera takes about 2 weeks to work. During those first 2 weeks, you may have some side effects including drowsiness, constipation, high heartbeat etc., but your symptom profile will shift over time. 

&gt; But, much like an antidepressant, Strattera basically works 24 hours once it is ""on"" after these two weeks. You will experience likely consistent symptoms and consistent side effects. They may shift over time, but this will be gradual. 

&gt; I had increases in concentration, increased awareness, increased ""presentness"" etc. It felt like... you know those allergy meds commercials where the person takes the meds and then pulls the dull grey-ish screen off the video? That's what it felt like. Not a huge change, but a noticeable shift from unmedicated me. 

&gt; On the highest (too high) dose, all those were increased but came with increased agitation and aggression too. I also could not sleep regularly on that dose, so we brought it down to the dose I ended up sticking to. 

&gt; As for strattera being the shittier (or shit tier) ADHD drug, it is effective in a smaller portion of the ADHD population (I've heard ~50% but don't quote me). It also tends to come with side effects for the majority of users ranging from the major to the minor. 

&gt; However, if it hadn't been for the sleep side effects (I was regularly getting 4-6 hours of sleep every night. Even on weekends when I could sleep in) I would still be on it now. It was reliable. I didn't have to take pills with me to school to top up my concentration in the afternoon. I didn't need to worry about medication in the evenings when I went out with friends. It didn't really interact with anything I ate or drank, so I could just live my life normally. 

&gt; It was less effective than stimulants, for me, in increasing concentration at a dose I could tolerate, but YMMV.

My parents are slowly getting better at accepting this, but they still have an extremely long way to go. It's pretty bloody hard having to comprehend the diagnosis for myself, and having to constantly educate them doesn't make it any easier (because I still have no clue really)...

"559","The difference with insulin and amphetamines, which I’m taking and do help a lot, is that a normal person can take them and get things done. They get noticeable benefit from it as well. So, as someone with a family history of drug abuse, and someone who personally has had problems with substance abuse and self medication, it is difficult to not feel like an addict.     
     
I also have a lot of trouble with doctors, again due to family history. I don’t like dealing with them at all. So my checkups consist basically of going and getting a script and getting out of there. However, the fact is, I feel like I’m on too low a dose of vyvanse, and I don’t know how to bring that up, because my brain is saying “stop it, you’re just making a shit up”. I’ve taken double dose of my vyvanse before, sometimes accidentally, sometimes because I wanted to (not that I’ve done it for a long time, but wanting to is still there) - on those days, things felt right. I recently accidentally took two, ended up doing a whole lot of things that I needed to get done for a while - but how can I say that’s because it’s what I need, when it could entirely be because I accidentally got myself high? I personally feel like I’m just a shit lazy person, because even though I take the medication every day I don’t manage to do the things I should.                
     
Additionally, I am prescribed dexamphetamine pills. They act as a booster dose,  but I find it difficult to manage. I patiently wait (sometimes unsuccessfully) til mid day to take them, at which point things start being a lot easier. Especially in the realm of anxiety, suddenly being around/interacting with people becomes something I want to do, rather than something to avoid at all costs. How can I say I’m not just an addict when I want to feel like that all the time? How can I not feel like an addict when the meds wear off, and I start feeling bad, feeling anxious again and wishing that the feeling hadn’t ended? How can I say I’m not just addicted when I feel like I need this pill to be able to enjoy things?      
       
While it is a lovely attitude to have that “You are not an addict, you need this”, and while it is entirely true, as someone who’s seen abuse: feeling like you need something IS addiction. I suppose the one difference is that, an addict will say all day “I could stop taking this, it’s up to me, blah blah bullshit” - with medication you know you can’t just stop taking it. You *know* you need it, and it can become difficult to differentiate between *thinking* you need it.","ezz0xkt",1,1568278444,"2019-09-12 08:54:04"

"568","Today I was browsing /r/ADHD for the first time. It's hard seeing my kind of people roughing it out together so much. 

To answer your question, yes there are positive traits to ADHD. Otherwise natural selection wouldn't have kept it around for so long (and make it so plentiful), and many of those kids that used to stare out the window in the back of class, do risky things like take crazy drugs like LSD, start businesses and disobey authority way back in the past wouldn't have become famous throughout history.

In our modern day, where performance, sticking with the status quo and success is clearly praised over ingenuity and originality, have you ever asked if modern society is making ADHD seem a lot worse than it really is? 

The article [here](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/29/children-used-to-be-scared-of-the-dark-now-they-fear-failure) explains that failure these days is now more feared than the dark within children. I believe it's because society makes performance, and therefore ADHD a huge problem, but you answer the question as to why that is.


I find ADHD to be like everything else, there's a positive and negative side to it. It is similar to the symptoms of aspergers and bipolar disorder. The people with aspergers being some of the smartest people I know (despite not  being able to read emotions), and bipolar people are by far the most creative people in the world. 


Want to know the positives to ADHD? Don't take what one researcher said as absolute truth and do your own research. Go through books, historic articles, google searches, learn neural science, and for a deeper understanding learn computer science graph theory and neural networking. If you really have ADHD, exploring enough will allow you to really come to your own conclusions.


A book I would start with is ""The Self-Made Billionaire Effect"" then read ""Dreamers, Discoverers &amp; Dynamos: How to Help The Cool Who is Bright, Bored and Having Problems in School"" then search from there. The first book will make you more aware of the different processing models our brains follow.

As for me, I think ADHD is a semi-supervised localized divergent processing model in our brains -- used with Kats Centrality (also known as Page rank) in Google's search engine for better seemingly unrelated results. It improves our creativity, makes us a bit more unpredictable and makes people with ADHD traits more likely a conduit of change in society. We're horrible at following list and rules, but ultimately we explore, connect seemingly unrelated dots and create our own rules that a large sum of the world will follow. 

There's some information online and through book (some made prior to ADHD diagnosis) that shows that some of the top scientist, actors, businessmen and more had traits like hyperactivity and massive amounts of curiosity and creativity (traits of ADHD). 

I could be wrong, but who cares? That's what I believe. Be independent, be scientific, and question everything you're told like a scientist would. Find your own answer. If you don't thoroughly check the thoughts of others you'll become of a sheep of somebody else's opinions. You don't want that. Unless you do, then never mind.

If you do and it doesn't work, i.e.; he flames out, ask him to visit us here. Maybe we can talk him down, and explain that you're only trying to help. Sometimes that comes across better from a third party.

"591","Holy smoke that's a lot of hairbands! Why do you own so many?

Edit: just realized that we may speak different dialects of English. Where I'm from a hairband is a rigid arc of some material, often plastic or wire with cloth around it, that sits on the forward part of the top of the head and usually sits either behind the ears or makes a full circle around the head. It occurs to me that by headbands you may be referring to what I would call elastics, which are just rubber bands with a soft exterior so they don't rip hair out, used to secure hair in a certain position and style like a ponytail or braid. Then again, people with ADHD are known to collect a lot if stuff, so that you might actually own sixteen hairbands is still possible and I must know. ","crokpd7",1,1432882308,"2015-05-29 06:51:48"

&gt;We rely on calendars and setting alarms on our phones.

&gt;We feel shitty when we forget to text important people back.

&gt;Some of us really struggle to hold jobs.

&gt;But you know what?

&gt;We remember to smile when we are present.

&gt;We find joy in little things other people don’t. (I see you pretty leaf on the sidewalk!)

&gt;We remember to treat people kindly because we know life’s struggle.

&gt;Relying on our phones alarms isn’t so bad. At least we are trying.

&gt;When we do text people back we apologize and the people who matter will understand.

&gt;When we do find jobs that fit us we excel and are brilliant, creative, productive people!

&gt;Stop being so hard on yourself. What’s the use in beating yourself up? Get up, go take that shower, make yourself a good meal, and go for a walk.

Stimulants are very crude drugs, they require a big lifestyle change and a lot of responsibility on your part or your body will waste away. My parents took me off Ritalin when I was in the second grade because they wanted me to make the decision for myself whether or not I wanted to use stimulants. Started using them when I was 20, stopped taking them a year later because it really wasn't worth it. Adderall, mixed amphetamine salts, is pretty much speed. Usually I'd suggest that people try a reuptake inhibitor rather than stimulants, but it doesn't seem to work very well for younger people. So just be careful, and best of luck!

"634","Yeeeaaaahhh... Well knowing I have ADHD has helped me not be so hard on myself afterwards (got diagnosed less than a year ago). Although I must say I do get a little more self conscious now because I am more aware of the verbal diarrhea while it happens. 

For example, in the past EVERY boyfriend or close friend used to always ask me why I was so intelligent in private but I loved to portray this ""bimbo-esque"" persona when they first introduced me to people. It was like they were embarrassed too because they had to stick up for me since I was really overly ditzy and would say ""sarcastic"" things that no one seemed to get. I defended myself by just saying it was more fun to play dumb card from the beginning than to be expected to contribute since I thought all those people were dumb anywayyyyy. So I kinda got stuck with that persona (Since I believed I was doing it on purpose I didn't think there was an issue). 

Now being aware of it has forced me out of my comfort zone and I'm actually trying really hard to contribute and teach those who lack social perspective (I'm very passionate about teaching about mental disorders now to provide better understanding because I myself lacked so much knowledge/perspective before finding out how it affected me and my family). But it's really freaking hard maaaaan. Because my thoughts are not linear and not many can follow. They are great thoughts nonetheless! I also noticed that connections that are obvious to me I have to backtrack for  other people to understand (but these are the people that already love me and have more patience to begin with). I do hate the fact that as a society we gage intelligence based on very few limiting factors, and I want to help spread awareness about that too. 

Buuuuut frustration aside I know it's something I need to keep practicing because if there is a child out there whose life can be made better (or even adult) that one conversation will be ALL worth it.

Blah, sorry for the length. I want to spread acceptance and get really passionate about it.

**My ADHD issues**

*Impulsivity*

When I want to do something, I have a hard time focusing on anything else but that. The best example, was when I wanted to play the drums. I bought a used electronic drumset, played it 3 times and sold it after a month. Now this might seem like ""oh thats not so bad"", but at that time, I lived in a small studio appartment. So not only did I have my credit card closed, because I just ""had"" to buy the drumset a week before I got payed, but I also ended up selling my bed, to buy a shorter bed, because the drumset wouldnt fit otherwise.

When this happens, I cant think of anything else but the thing I'm obsessing about. I cant concentrate on my homework, because I'm looking at cheap electronic dumsets online.

This leads to financial issues, forgotten homework and deadlines. Its also pretty hard to explain to your girlfriend, why you dont have a bed anymore.

Now this is an extreme example. But it also makes it hard to watch a movie or have a conversation with my girlfriend, when I'm busy thinking about this cool new gadget thats only 2$ in china. Shopping on an empty stomack is a recipe for disaster.

*Internal hyperactivity*

My brain always works in overdrive. I pretty much never ""not"" think. This is great, if I'm in control of whatever is happening, and my brain wants to travel within the realm of this subject. I'm great at finding examples and counter examples on things, to improve my understanding of subjects. I'm funny, because my brain is constantly making up jokes, and about 20% of those are actually funny.

The downside is when I have to do something thats boring. I really dont handle boredom well. If I read a boring subject, my mind will be wandering. If I have to listen to someone, who might be talking a bit slow, or explaining a subject more thoroughly than I need, I struggle to keep focus and not start talking over them. So lectures are really hard for me.

It also makes me do ""weird"" subject jumps during conversations, because I had already thought all the thoughts from a-z in my head, in the timespan that it took the other person to say something. But people get really confused, when I start talking about the election in france, because for some strange reason, they cant see how it is connected to the tight economic situation of danish farmers.

Another downside is my inability to keep a task in mind. So if I'm trying to learn to do a presentation for an exam, I have a hard time keeping the direction. I know the theory and if the professor asks me questions I can mostly answer them. But during the presentation my mind will wander, and I will end up talking about a whole other part of the subject, than what I was supposed to talk about. (Medicine helps a LOT with this. Its problems with ""Working memory"". Keeping whatever your doing in front of you, mentally.)

*Decisions*

I have a hard time with decisions sometimes. It's expensive, in terms of ""energy"", for me to take a decision. I have to weigh all the options. So when I'm tired, I can't really make decisions. When I dont have a reason to choose one option over the other, I cant make a decision. And when I've planned something, but the plans change, it takes a while for me to accept this new plan, even though I can see that the new plan is better or the old plan cant succeed. The fact that I have to change all the ""images"" in my head, makes me very reluctant.

For an example, me and my girlfriend were walking downtown, and she asked me whether I wanted to eat on restaurant A or restaurant B. I didnt care, and I told her so. She wanted me to take a decision. Behind the scenes, my lack of opinion made her think I didnt care about eating with her. She got a bit upset, when I flipped a coin after she forced me to make a decision. This was before I was diagnosed.

Another example is when I moved in together with my girlfriend. We had bought a couch, and we had planned where to place it. Long story short, it couldnt be placed where we had planned, but my girlfriend and my sister quickly found another place. I could see that the original plan was impossible, and that the new plan was seemingly the best way to place the couch. I just couldnt accept it for a couple of days.

*Changing tasks and changing plans*

To stop doing one thing and start doing another, when its not my brain deciding to switch, is really hard. When my girlfriend tells me that she is heading to bed, and if I want to join her, the answer is always no. 5 minutes later its yes 75% of the time. Then my brain has had time to adjust.

Changing plans is hell. If a friend asks me if I want to go for a drink, I never really want to. Even if I hadnt planned for anything that night, my standard reaction is ""I dont want to do this"". Its not that I dont want to, but I guess its just difficult to commit to something. The irony of being impulsive, but not being able to handle others impulsivity.","digg1wz",2,1496607273,"2017-06-04 20:14:33"

"670","The best advice I can give you is you need to eat balanced, regular meals that are high in nutritional value. I have hypoglycemia which means if my blood sugars drop, I act like a hangry drunk so the advice for my condition still applies to your situation.

So what that means:

* You need to eat at least 3-5 meals per day. 3 of those meals are breakfast, lunch and supper. 2 of those meals are snacks. In practice, you will have breakfast first thing in the morning, then 2 hours later a snack, followed by lunch then 2-3 hours later a snack and supper around 5-6pm then a final snack around 8pm.
* Secondly, I don't know if you know much about calories, but the big meals should have about 400-500 calories each., and the little snacks should have 150-300 calories each
* Thirdly, you want to load up each meal with protein and fiber, not so much sugar- sugar isn't very filling and you just want more.
* Ideas for breakfasts: Breakfast Carnation (protein source) with a cup of milk, plus have some fruit and cereal
* Snacks ideas: Nuts with fruit; yogurt and fruit; vegetables with hummus; peanut butter and a banana; etc.
* Lunches and suppers: having 2-3 vegetables to make you feel full, 1 source of protein like beans, chicken, fish, eggs, etc. and a starch like a potato, noodles, squash, bread 
* DRINK LOTS OF WATER- HAVE 2 CUPS PER MEAL AND SNACK- YOU NEED WATER. If it helps, you can flavour it with lemon or buy that artificial sweetener stuff from dasani.

Basically, eating like that helps me maintain my weight while making me feel like I'm not going to be tempted to eat my hand for a snack. It allows for a steady blood sugar level instead of dips and valleys which can affect your performance and mood.

Another thing I do is the rewind button. On YouTube for example, if you press the left arrow key, it rewinds like 5 seconds which was perfect. I think VLC rewinds 1 minutes which was excessive but shift+arrow key rewinds like 15 seconds. Of course this tip is only good if you watch movies on your laptop/PC.

"710"," I have more random moving advice below. But as to decluttering, these are some useful questions to ask yourself:  


* If I lost this, would I buy it again?
* Am I keeping this out of guilt?
* Could it be more useful to someone else than you if you donated it?
* Am I just delaying this item going to landfill?   


Set a timer and take breaks because you will get major decision fatigue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a LOT of books and general stuff and moved house five times in five years once. This is all my general moving advice I learnt from experience:  


* Get a clipboard and tie a pen to it with some yarn or string. Stick a pad of A4 paper or a wodge of printer paper into it. A delivery man once told me that “A clipboard makes you feel like everything's under control, even when it isn't.” 
* Get boxes, permanent marker, and several rolls of non-black bin bags (they can be white, green, blue, whatever). Buy normal black bin bags too. 
*  When you fill a box write the following on the outside - A number and the room it came from. That is all. So it might say ""BOX 5 - LIVING ROOM""
* On the clipboard, write the number of the box and roughly what is in it. Just start at one. So it might say, ""Box 5 Living Room - Contents of coffee table drawers and dvds."" 
* This is useful because anyone helping you move can just see quickly which room each box needs to go to - they do not need to know what is in it. But you have the clipboard for locating things later on, when you are going, ""Where is the iron?"" and you can find that it is in box 37 and you just have to hunt for box 37. 
* Put fabric, yarn, clothes, all duvets and linens in the white or blue or whatever bin bags. Write a number and room on the bag with permanent marker BEFORE you fill it and add that to the clipboard. (Using non-black bags means your treasured stuff will not get thrown away or, as I did once, you don't move bags of rubbish by mistake.)
* Put actual non-recyclable rubbish in the black bags. 
* Schedule a day for recycling / tip run shortly before you move. 
* Eat stuff from the freezer first. Unless you are moving a very short distance, you don't want to move frozen food. 
* Fill one box called ""moving day"". Cover it in stars or exclamation marks or something. This is the box that will help you stay sane. Put these things inside: Toilet roll, wash bag, light bulbs, kettle, camping mug, instant hot chocolate, spoon, fork, phone chargers, cleaning stuff (your own dirt is fine, but for some reason other people's dirt is unbearable) crisps and chocolate. Put the clipboard in there if you like or tie it to yourself on moving day. DO NOT LOSE THE CLIPBOARD. Put a sleeping bag, or know where your duvet and pillow are. It is not fun sleeping under a coat with a pile of boxes towering over you! 
* The day before moving day, buy something you can eat on the day and share with helpers, removal folk. I like mars bars, crisps, cans of coke, a massive slabs of brioche, pasties. But you may prefer something healthier. Stuff you don't need cutlery for. Also get out enough cash to buy a takeaway with on the night you move in. 

Good luck!! You can do it!!

From a young age, I managed to get through school and university because I was very good at rote learning and could even stretch to having a photographic memory back when I wasn't a burnt out drunk father of 4.

Humanities and languages I sucked at. Anything requiring some degree of creativity, formation of own opinions /ideas as opposed to just recall of facts, I was terrible at.

Medical school was ok because with enough repetition, I could do the things I needed to do.

My struggle now as a consultant /attending, is that the clinical work is seen as something wr can do in our sleep. It is now the management /governance/improvement of the system stuff that we are expected to do, and I find that hard because it involves discussions, meetings, trying to 'adult', and a lot of it flies over my head. I can make excuses, but I am being paid for this as a portion of my work, so I need to be more on the same wavelength. Hopefully with a diagnosis and help, I can still hold on to a job.

My current primary is terrible and just likes to throw meds at me to see what happens. I was in the process of changing doctors when all the coronovirus stuff hit, so it's going to be a while before I can establish care anywhere else.

"733","My brother is a doctor, and I have to say that oftentimes an enlarged ego comes along with that degree. That’s what happens sometimes when you’re smart enough to get through med school (which is very smart) and then have patients who are coming to you with no medical knowledge. They are trained to show up, ask a question or two, look for symptoms, and leave with a diagnosis or referral in as little time as possible. 

You aren’t responsible for that. You are responsible for what you said, and you apologized and took responsibility for it. I assume you’re working on your impulse control and that’s all you can do. Forgive yourself, learn from this, and understand that your Doctor was being a little too sensitive about what you said. 

Last thing: I’m not anti doctor/medicine or anything, I just think we all need to be advocates for our own health and question what they tell us. Not in a “I googled my symptoms and it looks like I’m suffering from being vaccinated as a baby and being told the world is round” kind of way.

"743","I'm a little bit confused about the inattentive versus hyperactive ADHD part here. The types are only differentiated based on what symptoms you display. So, if you can ""sit still and shut up"", then you probably don't have hyperactive ADHD. The hyperactivity in your head is normally what causes a lot of the inattentive symptoms in ADHD, but that doesn't mean you necessarily have the hyperactive type or those symptoms. 

Fidgeting is only one symptom for the hyperactive/ impulsive side and I think you need at least 4 to be considered the hyperactive type (or combined type if you have the inattentive symptoms too, which most people do). Also, the medicines the 2 types are the same, so this shouldn't cause you to get a different medicine.

"749","I see both a psychologist and a psychiatrist; the former for building better ADHD habits, the latter for medication.

A big obstacle for balancing your dosage is how hard it is for the doctor to quantify all of the other things going on in your life. Other medications can definitely change your effective window, things like gut health and food allergies can also play a role. The net result is that your doctor can end up second-guessing or ignoring the feedback you give, because they're looking for (or ignoring) a secondary factor. It's a messy practice.

Talking to a psychiatrist can definitely feel scary, and it took me a while to get used it. I worried about not communicating clearly or being misinterpreted, and ending up with some kind of misdiagnosis.

I worked through that by focusing on my meta-communication, pointing out where I felt I couldn't adequately communicate things and explicitly recognizing when there are gaps between what I'm dealing with overall and what I'm focused on at the moment. 

That really helped me, because I found that most of the questions the psychiatrist and psychologist asked were focused on the current moment, and that it was on me to make connections between my symptoms. By communicating about my communication and making a point to put things in context, it was a lot easier to for both me and them to see the whole picture.

"756","Finding the right meds can be super tricky, because people react differently to the different ADHD meds depending (at least somewhat) on their genetics. I hear they’re even developing systems to identify which ‘ADHD genes’ a patient has, so they can prescribe accordingly. The specific genes are apparently the best indicator of what medications will and won’t work.

I’m pretty satisfied with Vyvanse, but I’m conscious that there could be another medication out there that suits me even better. This one has - purportedly - the most gradual up and down though, which is important to me.

When you say tiredness and brain fog, do you mean during or after the medication’s effective period?

How I remember my psych explaining it to me (I’m paraphrasing so don’t quote me on this) the ‘crash’ at the end of the day on stim meds is partly your brain going into ‘negative numbers’ on the neurotransmitter chart. If an unmedicated day is 0, and a medicated morning is 10, by the time the medication is out of your system that evening, it’s become a -2. The pendulum swings the other way a little as it returns to neutral.

"767","It's hard to say without coming across as an asshole but I'm just gonna bite the bullet: 

This explanation is incorrect on many levels. 

An example of a DRI would be methylphenidate (ritalin), which binds to and blocks dopamine transporters (DAT) which typically remove dopamine from the synapse/extracellular space and back into the neuron for reuse (from there it gets moved from the cytoplasm into little ""bubbles"" called vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT, and these vesicles are where dopamine is released from when the neuron is stimulated in a Ca^2+ driven process). 

Alternatively, amphetamines (adderall) act on VMAT and DAT (and NET) and reverse transport - as amphetamine is both taken up by VMAT and binds to and alters itsconformation/function, and forces monoamines *out* of the vesicles as it enters them itself, then the same process occurs to force dopamine out of the cell body and into the synapse.

As far as medication, Geodon (ziprasidone) could make you very zombie-ish whether you have bipolar disorder or not. Do you have issues with depression, or more manic episodes? Bipolar medications need to be monitored very carefully, because too much can trigger a depressive swing. Many people end up on a combo of antipsychotics (for mania and mood stabilization), depression medication, and sometimes ADHD meds if they have that as well. I have many patients on that combination.

"779","**Repetition**

**Association**

**Hands on/Doing it themselves**

**&amp; Visuals**

I taught martial arts for a while mostly volunteer work. Took me forever to earn my black belt, but I did.

Even though I have ADHD, I've been often called 'the best' teacher, simply due to the fact that I can teach 'anyone'. Most likely due to me being the most difficult to teach lol.

When teaching a new technique, I first demonstrate it visually.

Then I teach the association of the said technique with a real world situation, or something in History. In Kendo there is a lot of 'samurai' type history, so it's easy to come up with associations.

Then I use said technique on my student, and then I show them how to do the technique on me.

The final parts of teaching something new is repetition. Never expect your student, especially an ADHD student to get it all down the first time. You will have to go back and review, or have them show you the technique you taught them from time to time.

Through repeating something several times, and through all the other teaching methods I mentioned, you will be able to teach almost anyone more efficiently.

**Also**

Another teaching method I did not mention is writing something down.

When learning all my best martial art techniques, the first thing I'd do when I'd get home is write them down in a journal.

That seemed to further burn a technique into my mind.

I do five cycles of ten minutes (one for each room of my house)  and I can really make a lot of progress in that time The timer really creates a sense of urgency, which is amazing for us and our need for those adrenaline surges to get stuff done.

Regardless, Micro-managers can be reverse managed if handled delicately. 

My favourite way to counter micro-managers is to simply over communicate to them. BCC every client correspondence they ask you to handle. Send an ""update email"" if there's no written correspondence and only a call. Go out of your way to ask their opinion of you solution on a job. Involve them before they involve themselves. Control the flow of information and don't succumb to feeling like they're pressuring you, put the pressure on them.

Personally, in the situations I have dealt with over my 10 years in IT support and operations engineering, this neutralizes the ""threat"" of micro management - don't get me wrong, it's still there but you control it and it's no longer a problem just an irritation that you have a set of skills to deal with.","csyfedk",2,1436522236,"2015-07-10 09:57:16"

PSA: if you burn black tea down to nothing it smells like pot smoke! The roommate came upstairs (he has 2 rooms and a bathroom in the basement, we only share the kitchen) and asked if we were smoking lol he has ADHD too so he understood at least!

Alterous: experiences attraction that can only be described as a desire for emotional closeness because neither romantic or platonic attraction is accurate, is intended to be used in place of romantic or platonic.* for example someone may identify as bi-alterous, poly-alterous, homo-alterous, etc. (*note: a person who IDs this way may experience varying degrees of attraction that is identifiable as romantic or platonic but ultimately feel discomfort / unease / or just a sense of inaccuracy in calling it wholly romantic or platonic)

"871","Personally, I think an ADHD parent has the potential for a best case scenario for an ADHD kiddo. When I started recognizing my own behaviors in my kiddos (5 year old girl, 7 year old boy), I began to teach them the various coping strategies I had figured out over time.   


It takes a lot of open, honest communication with the kids and it isn't easy. This is especially true whenever I am in the middle of my own ADHD behaviors and I have to refocus myself to be present and engaged with them when they need it. I have had my own moments where I jump from minor frustration/irritation into emotional overload as the kids' needs compound into everything else going on.   


When I hit those moment, I make a point to step myself through re-centering and refocusing where they can see me doing it. I then talk to them and explain to them what happened, what I did, and why just as I do with them in their moments. It also means they are getting good at pulling me, and each other, out of internal rabbit holes so we are present with each other.  


When they are unfocused, I sit with them and we talk about what needs to happen and why it is important. Then we work out individual steps to accomplish what needs to be done, work out a reward system for accomplishing the steps/goal, and set timers. That gets them excited, engaged, and lets them see progress. Afterwards, regardless of success or failure, we discuss what happened (feelings, distractions, what worked, what didn't), brainstorm on what can be improved, and praise them for what they did really well.  


Over time I've made the steps more complicated and the reward requirements steeper.

  
When it comes to hyperfocus, I have learned it is 80%+ about setting expectations and having understanding beforehand. We mostly experience this with various screen time, but most obviously with video games. I've learned to keep them capped to no more than 30 minutes at a time, setting a timer, and being very firm on that limit. There were emotional outbursts and arguments at first: that was only 5 minutes, I am trying to finish this level, etc...  


To help with this, I have them set the timer and remind them when we really enjoy something, it is easy to lose track of time (they also both have digital and analog clocks in their rooms so they can be aware of time). I remind them showing me they can pause and turn the screen off calmly is how they earn more screen time later.   


When it comes to challenges like virtual schooling, we have a lot of conversations about perception. Many of those conversations sound like, ""You know you are still listening, and I know you are still listening, but it is important to show your teacher that  you are listening by keeping your eyes on the screen and remaining seated. If you are having trouble focusing, then you can borrow one of my fidget tools that I use during my meetings. Just remember to play with it while not looking at it so  your teacher knows you are still listening.""  


Whenever I witness them do these things independent of my intervention and coaching, they get a bonus amount of the in-house reward system we developed; an in house currency system we call ""Kitten Cash"" (1 Kitten Cash = $.01 using customized fake money). I also keep a stock of things the kids like/want on a shelf that acts as in home store. It has books, video games, pokemon cards, activity books, etc.. so they have a visual stimulus of things they can get, but also teach them how to manage money as a brand new video game can take 6 weeks to earn enough for. They can earn currency for various uninteresting chores/tasks that gets paid out before bedtime.   


I hope this helps.","golhf4e",2,1614183827,"2021-02-24 16:23:47"

"876","It’s probably boring to write. I would get annoyed if I had to sit there and try to write everything so what I did was just write down all my ideas and whatever else was related to the topic. I’d draw a diagram and grouped things together that made sense, ordering them, mainly trying to figure out if what made sense in my head made sense on paper. It’s a lot of active thinking but it didn’t bother me because I could just go on and on about the subject since I enjoyed it(just not the sitting and writing part). I’d stop there and if I was too tired or too frustrated I’d call it a day. What mattered most was quality and if it wasn’t good I’d do it again until it could make sense on paper. Once that was done I’d then structure it in a way that I could reasonably sit down and write for a certain time and still be able to explain everything fully. I use Grammarly to help with little things since going back to fix everything sounds like a nightmare after all that work. If I felt like I could keep going then I would stop to look at it and see if I could just find more sources or something. My general rule of thumb is that if I feel like I can definirte do more, I only do a little. If I feel like I can do a little then I’ll stop. I picked this up from track practice in from my high school coach. I was a pentathlete and he told me if I felt like I could do two more (arbitrary exercise or distance) do one more. If I felt like I could do one more then I should stop. I’d rather it be good work that I cared about then bad work I was anxious about. If it fell short from a perfect score or something than I knew what to fix next time.

Percentage of 11% of children being clinically diagnosed is pretty legitimate. Ive read alot of different percentages, but its about this and about half of people grow up and continue to have ADHD into adulthood, which i can explain if youd like but i tend to ramble.

To be diagnosed with ADHD you have to have multiple symptoms that impact multiple aspects of your life. However, there are other Psychiatric conditions like Bipolar, Anxiety and depression that can mimic ADHD like symtoms and people can be falsely diagnosed. Ive talked to alot of people who were diagnosed with depression or anxiety but actually it was the incorrect diagnosis and they had ADHD. But it does happen the other way too. Can be diagnosed with ADHD but acctually just have Anxiety. Theres a nice little table that shows it [here](http://assets.spaceded.com/photos/17650/overlapping_symptoms.gif)

But...having ADHD makes you more likely to have another psychiatric condition, mainly anxiety, depression and ODD.
Anxiety due to alot of us being socially excluded and isolated as well as over analyzing situations
Depression due to low self esteem from doing poorly even though youre trying hard and being an outsider. Not fitting into the crowd.
ODD, because, well. For DSM 5 anyway, you literally only need one more tick in a box because ODD involves emotional dysregulation (ADHD Symptom)

The part about ADHD traits, is that yeah. Everyone has them. A comment to criticize 'everyone has ADHD sometimes' from Jessica McCabe ( [How to ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nPM1_kSZf91ZGkcgy_95Q) ) 'Everyone thats taller than the ground is tall, so tall doesnt exist' or 'that since sometimes we are taller than the person next to us, we are all tall sometimes' but that someone whos 6'5 theyre tall pretty much all the time....

Psychotherapy is more commonly known as CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) too, incase you see it somewhere and wonder what it means.

I tried to comment pretty consisely but am willing to talk more. What was the purpose of your thread may i ask? Do you think you might have ADHD? A friend? We can help, let us know!

-Being really careful with the amount of caffeine I get. It sucks, especially when I'm not taking medication it can feel like it's the only thing that helps a bit, but the half life is 5-6 hours, so if you want to sleep at 23.00 you'll still have half of your 17:00 coffee in your system. 

-Take the time to wind down. For my mind to process everything that happened during the day, it's nice to have some time without a lot of new input (so that means slow evenings, with a lot of showering, self-care stuff, gathering things for the next day). 

-Use something like a podcast or audiobook to fall asleep to, it gives my mind something to anchor onto, so I don't dream up elaborate scenarios myself. (Those keep me awake longer).

Besides those things, it's basically doing ALL the things you see when you google sleep-hygiene, but for me the 3 things I mentioned help most of all. ","e2hn491",1,1531759665,"2018-07-16 16:47:45"

"965","I still deal with emotional disregulation at the age of 39, but that’s because I didn’t learn what it was until I was 38. I am still figuring out coping mechanisms, but there are things that have helped. 

First, just knowing about it helps. Knowing that my brain lies to me about what I am feeling was a big wake up call. I try to question what I am feeling and make sure my reaction is warranted.

Mindfulness meditation has helped a lot. It teaches us how to be aware of what we are feeling the moment we start feeling it. This way we can try to think about our feelings before we react to them. Meditation is the practice so it’s a little easier to do in real life.

Exercise has helped the most for me. Getting in a good 45 minutes of cardio at least 4 times per week helps keep my emotions in better balance with less mood swings.

Love and praise can be good preventative medicine. Of course do not praise bad behavior, but make sure she knows she is loved, and worthy of that love. With emotional disregulation, fear of rejection can cause a person to lash out first, to subconsciously devalue the people in her life so that it will hurt less when they reject her.","g2joowf",2,1598150883,"2020-08-23 02:48:03"

Some examples I've done in the past:

1) Got really interested in gardening and wanted to buy $300 worth of gardening supplies to try and fill up my back patio with plants. Decided to buy five of those $1 mini planters and a handful of seeds to see if I could even grow anything to begin with instead (I couldn't, and quickly lost interest in the whole thing). 

2) Interested in digital drawing as a kid, really wanted an expensive drawing tablet. Got a $100 drawing tablet instead and worked my way up to a $300 drawing tablet and finally a $600 one after almost nine years of drawing. 

3) Got interested in sewing. Bought a cheap $10 sewing kid from Walmart and some cheap $5 fabric. I've been sewing on and off for a few years now and I'm about to 'invest' in a $100-$200 sewing machine, but only because I've been hand sewing for so long that I know it's a worthwhile investment

4) Wanted to get a gym membership because I wanted to go to the gym more often. I decided I'd go to the gym for a month (paying individually each time I went, instead of getting a membership) and if I was still going after that month, I could invest in a membership. I quit after 2-3 weeks. I still spent the money but not as much as I would have on a membership.

**Always 'test drive' your hobby with the cheapest materials/options possible.** That way you'll a) save money if you drop the hobby and b) you'll actually have the experience to know *what* to spend your money on if you *do* decide to upgrade to better materials.

Vyvanse just metabolizes into dextroamphetamine, roughly 30% of Vyvanse by weight converts to d-amp while the drug is working. Adderall is 75% dextroamphetamine + levoamphetamine (the 2 chemical isomers of amphetamine), and Adderall XR is roughly the length of Vyvanse but has more physical side effects on average. Another option is dextroamphetamine XR, it's just dextroamphetamine inside of time-release capsules inside of a gel capsule (which is different than Vyvanse, as it's already dextroamphetamine and doesn't need to be metabolized before becoming active). Another option is dextroamphetamine IR (same thing, but shorter release), Adderall IR, etc. Dextroamphetamine XR is the closest thing there is to a Vyvanse generic, I believe.","es7smnk",3,1561678733,"2019-06-27 23:38:53"

Overall, I feel calmer - like I can process my thoughts clearly, not have racing thoughts jumbling up my brain, and overall function better.

Loss of appetite is the only major symptom I have noticed. It has gotten a bit better as I adjust to my medication, but I did lose 5 pounds.

The ""embrace your strengths"" has been thrown out by so many resources I've come across. So, I think not totally hating yourself and finding the positives is totally reasonable and OK.

"1035","I have a lot, but the first that comes to mind is a few days ago I was really tired and overworked (typical adhd exhaustion from trying to function like a normal person) and my dad had text me saying he was going to pick me up from this school thing but I’d fallen asleep and he had to wait almost an hour. When I finally woke up after sleeping through the many alarms I’d set just in case I fall asleep and his many, many texts, I went outside and frantically tried to open the wrong car. He has a pretty distinctive car, too, so I really had no excuse. Needless to say, he was a bit upset... except he has adhd too, so idk what’s wrong with me.

I also once had a professor who suddenly started using PowerPoints but she would just click through them at light speed and I told her I couldn’t keep up and asked her if she would post them on the website (most do that anyway) and she refused. She also refused to work with me about my accommodation forms and actually made it more difficult for me to keep up with them. Then, when only out of desperation I asked for her help, she yelled at me saying she wasn’t my secretary. She would do stuff like this every day. She also would yell at people every day, especially me, and single me out about things. Every. Single. Day. I was failing the class even though it shouldn’t have been too difficult because it was a subject I’m fairly good at. I eventually got so mad at her I refused to attend the class because I would have really bad anxiety whenever I went. This is uni btw. So a few weeks later, I get an email from the admin saying I needed to meet with some type of school organization success counselor or something. I tried to explain to them through email what had happened and why I was failing, and that I didn’t have time to go meet up because of how everything is for me and they made me go anyway. I missed two assignments I was going to try during that time, was late for a lab, and missed lunch because of the first meeting. This is because they blamed me at the meeting and I tried to patiently explain. They finally kind of got a clue and said there was nothing they could do for me, then made me go see this other admin guy. Then, after seeing him, he said there was nothing he could do for me, which was kind of what I was expecting. I missed a lot of school and assignments because of it, then because of that, had a huge panic attack and fell into a really bad bout of depression for about two weeks, missing even more school to the point where I couldn’t catch up. I also didn’t have any friends to support me in this because they either weren’t talking to me or didn’t understand. A lot of these people think I can just pull myself up by the bootstraps and get it together, but if I could I would have a long time ago. Finally, after about two weeks, there’s this lab/chill spot thing and over spring break I stayed at school and I was really too depressed to do anything so when I wasn’t at work, I would go there and just sit there not doing anything. Eventually I was talking to a professor there and he seemed to understand and not be critical, which made me feel better enough to keep trying. It was still really difficult though.","dy2caze",6,1524843316,"2018-04-27 15:35:16"

"1048","Satisfaction of doing chores:  dopamine reward doing long term maintenance without an immediate consequence doing otherwise.  Waiting until stuff smells, you're outa underwear, or an interview... stress reliance, inability to visualize the future and self motivate.

Restlessness as an adult:  Usually anxiety issue if restless for no reason.  Wanting to escape a situation, needing to run from obligation and work then doing so: lack of executive function and delay of gratification.

Getting distracted counting change:  adhd typically comes with a low working memory.   Gotta recount a million times.  There are tricks to counting we sometimes learn to avoid using working memory.  For instance a pyramid with a base of 4 is 10. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, arrange pyramids of pennies and dimes etc count the pyramids, no thinking.  

Getting pissed when broken out of concentration: you gotta get this done and doesnt this asshat know you're doing something?  Expressing said displeasure, low executive function.

Depression with no real reason: prop depression and serotonin issue.  

Emotional withdraw depression from being a failure, appropriate response given high expectations of self and lack of actualizing the self.  You want to do and be something, a person that does x, but you never do no matter how much you want to... is depressing.  Inability to actualize long term goals:  poor executive function, poor self regulation, inability to plan or delay gratification and get satisfaction from making steps toward a goal... adhd, low dopamine.

If an Antidepressent makes you feel ok being a failure:  No change in dopamine to solve issues, merely a change in serotonin to change how you feel emotionally about failure.

Assignments.  Doesn't matter the deadline, you don't start until a few days out: blindness to time, nearsightedness to future events and consequences, low dopamine in frontal lobe.  Need stress of a last minute deadline or crisis to get stuff done?  Inability to self motivate.

Answering all the questions blindly: 'hyperfocus' possibly.

Ignoring all the questions:  anyone would, really.  This isn't a question as much as self awareness i'm being retarded on the internet.","d9jlej5",2,1478150349,"2016-11-03 05:19:09"

What i am saying is, if you only ever did the medicine, chances are high that you will have troubles when going off meds.

Unfortunately for us unless it’s an absolute detriment to your physical health medication isn’t permitted, and even if it was a detriment and you essentially wouldn’t fast and you would donate food/money for every fast you would have to miss unless that’s too burdensome and then there are other means of making up for not fasting. Technically only medication that enter the throat and make its way to the stomach as well as any medical intervention that provides sustenance aren’t allowed. So medication‘s that have no caloric value that are in the form of a transdermal patch or ointment or cream would be permitted.

"1116","For me, Adderall XR calms me down mentally and physically. I went undiagnosed until 3 years ago, I’m 36(F). For years I just thought my lack of time awareness, forgetting something 5 seconds after telling myself to remember said thought, and just being a walking tornado was just an issue with me. I didn’t recognize my lack of inhibition was due to ADHD. ADHD is and should be classified as a spectrum disorder like Autism. Some of us are able to manage with some issues, others are unable to deal with the burden ADHD puts us through whether it’s with holding down a job, keeping up relationships, or able to be socially competent. I didn’t get diagnosed until I added going back to school while working full time. I was diagnosed with anxiety first, and put on an antidepressant. It helped for a little bit, but then it got worse. I was unable to focus in school, and I dealt with it by self medicating (cigarettes and alcohol). It didn’t click until another friend in the same age group as me was diagnosed. I decided to see if maybe it was the same for me as well since all my issues were the same as theirs. I’ve been on meds since day one of diagnosis and I literally cried the first time the Adderall kicked in. My mind wasn’t a jumbled mess. I’ve quit smoking, I rarely drink anymore maybe one beer a month, and I couldn’t be happier. I did also do CBT for almost 2 years, because let me tell you, after the joy of finally knowing what’s wrong, you start to agonize over the fact that no one noticed you were struggling. I still have issues with feeling like an imposter. I’ve never been hyperactive, but I can tell and so can my husband when I haven’t taken my meds. I’m more fidgety, more prone to outbursts and don’t hold back on what’s on my mind, even if it’s hurtful. I’m not a zombie on meds, but I’m more focused and not as reward driven as I am unmedicated. You can tell who needs stimulants versus who doesn’t. If it makes you hyper, you’re not ADHD. One sign of probably having ADHD is if you can drink caffeine all day and still pass out. Caffeine doesn’t work the same on us. I’ve actually found that some sedatives actually work more as a stimulant would on neurotypicals. But maybe that’s me. 

TLDR; Stimulants helps the ADHD brain function more efficiently, whether it’s by allowing more dopamine absorption, or just slowing our brains down so we can pick what we want to focus on. Otherwise it’s a jumbled mess of a million pop up ads that we have to try to find the one we want, but get distracted by another repeatedly. But really everyone has different reactions depending on the severity of the disorder or where we fall on the spectrum.","gc0qs3j",1,1605164385,"2020-11-12 06:59:45"

Re: the long-term memory recall, that's very interesting!  Especially since you're not talking about memories that were formed when you weren't on ADHD meds.  It seems like the trend in the literature is that drugs can help you remember things, e.g., on a test, but only if they're the drugs you took while studying, so that your mental state is parallel.  Your result suggests that mental state while memories are laid down may not be as big a factor if the mental state during recall is powerful enough.","cbua6vk",4,1377324673,"2013-08-24 06:11:13"

The increase in symptoms you're feeling is just a result of a strong dose with little tolerance. Ideally, **you should be taking 5 for a week, 10 for a week and so on until to you reach 20.** Your body needs time to adjust to your medication.

Reading back I just realized that each dose is taken twice daily, I feel that even that shouldn't be done until you know whether a redose is necessary or not. Many people find a single dose in the morning to be sufficient for their needs.","ffiffv9",1,1579972589,"2020-01-25 17:16:29"

"1154","Hey, hang in there.    

First of all, good for you for recognizing that you are in over your head and seeking out help for it - both on here and with your school. That seriously speaks well of you in terms of responsibility, awareness, motivation and proactive-ness (is that even a word?)   

Usually you can drop down to regulars at the middle of the year. But, if your guidance counselor is telling you that you can't I guess that that is the rule at your school. Have you asked your parents to intervene?   

I think that is kind of the key here. Talk to your parents. Explain what you are feeling and what is worrying you and the steps you have taken so far. Tell them that you want to do something about it but are lost and need their help. I don't think that that is a plea that any parent could turn down - I certainly couldn't.   

You might try that tactic with your teachers and guidance counselors and doctor/therapist, too. All these people likely have ideas and resources that you have no clue exists yet, you know? I mean, it IS their job, right?Worst case scenario, you still don't do well but everyone knows that you were trying. Often, teachers will look more kindly on work simply because of this fact.   

Some things that they might be able to do (at school):   
  -  Give you extended time on tests or at home assignment due dates   
  -  Allow you take tests in a different, quieter room   
  -  Modify assignments or allow you to take tests ""open book""  
  -  Provide copies of notes to supplement your own   
  -  Allow for you to record your lectures (on your smart phone or whatever)   
  -  Arrange for a tutor   
  -  Provide before, after, or lunchtime extra help or workshopping  
  -  Allow you to hand in any work you might be missing for credit without penalty  
  -  Recommend a study skills workshop   

I know you said you need more time and a less demanding workload. That doesn't sound like it is going to happen right now, really, so you will have to figure out another way. You know the old saw: ""Work smarter; not harder."" 

This is what worked for my tenth grader:   
First, figure out where your problem is. Sit down, and make a list with three columns. In the first column, list all of the areas of your life that are bothering you right now. List each class and extra curricular responsibility seperately. You can even put things like ""social life"" or ""organization in general"" on there if you like. Leave lots of space in between each. Next to each of these, put the specific problem or problems you are having. You can have everything from ""I keep losing my worksheets"" to ""I can't see the board in English class"" to ""I hate my math teacher"" to ""I can't sleep at night"" to ""I just don't understand the material"" to ""I keep forgetting to take out the garbage"" on here. In the final column, brainstorm any solutions you can think of to these issues, no matter how outlandish or impossible you think they are. Bring it to your mom or dad. See if they have any ideas for solutions. Hell, post it here! Look over your list. See if there are any patterns.  

If you need any more help or a more specific plan, come on back here. We have helped my kid bring her grades up by about 12 points per class since the middle of the last quarter - so there are ways. Good Luck!","cdxqnj8",2,1386628498,"2013-12-09 22:34:58"
"1155","I'm not exactly what you're looking for - I am a recently diagnosed adult with primarily inattentive type, but I did fine through high school because my parents checked my grades online and made sure I actually submitted stuff. But, I failed out of college the first time without the external motivation. I just started non-stimulant meds a little over a month ago, so I'm largely still relying on coping techniques and drive to meet my goal. I'm 1 year/3 semesters into an Associate's, and so far it's going well - I have a planner where I write down EVERYTHING and I check it at least once a day but usually many times; I set personal deadlines for having things done before the thing is actually due so that I have some margin of error; I try to be deliberate about taking breaks when I need them while doing homework, and not to get sucked into something else while I'm having them; I make sure that I go to every single class, barring serious illness or such, because it's a lot easier for me to learn by listening and taking notes than trying to read a textbook. I try to avoid online classes for this reason, but it's not always possible with my degree at my school. For me, this attempt at college is much different than the first because I know that I have ADHD so I can be deliberate about compensating for it, and I have a specific goal which is very important to me so that helps with providing motivation.

I think that it would benefit all of us neurodivergent folks if -- when broad commonplace terms, like will power, are used -- we define our terms. E.g., I have ditched work because I I didn't want to do something and I have uselessly puttered about work as I couldn't organize and apply myself. There's an overlap of ""willpower"" and executive functioning, but they are not synonymous.

And to further complicate the issue, there are times I've ditched work because I was frustrated and disorganized in excess of what a neurotypical person would be in a similar situation.

&gt; Our study, which is one of the largest set of longitudinal studies of this issue to date, supports the association between ADHD and substance abuse found in several earlier studies and shows that **the increased risk cannot be accounted for by coexisting factors such as other psychiatric disorders or family history of substance abuse**,”

Specifically

&gt; Treating ADHD with medications appeared to reduce the tendency to abuse drugs and alcohol. While 75 percent of the unmedicated ADHD boys had started abusing these substances in the previous 4 years, this was true of only 25 percent of the medicated ADHD boys and 18 percent of the boys without ADHD. The researchers calculated that treating ADHD with medications reduced the risk of substance abuse or dependence by 84 percent.

That said, I don't 100% trust their definition of abuse. :) I prefer not to cite things from government drug studies, but in this case the discrepancy is so damn large, even accounting for a 2x ""government war on drugs bullshit factor"" there is a clear difference!

"1176","Why would either of those things piss you off? How is it your business what other people do, let alone to the extent that it would ANGER you?

Like why would you even care at all what other people do in their personal dating lives. 

The only thing I can think is that, men who are angry about rejection from young women console themselves with the notion that over 30, the roles will be reversed and they will be the ones doing the rejecting? And it's angering to learn that not only doesn't happen over 30, but *never* happens, because you feel like you deserve revenge and won't get it?

Maybe your anger has to do with why you are having trouble attracting the women you are interested in? Just a guess. 
Or the notion that you HATE women who don't want kids, which hints at some kind of scary ideas about women that probably frighten off even women who do want kids? 

I am just average and date average guys who I like. People who are average will generally be attracted to each other within the same general range. It's nothing surprising. You'll run into trouble if you're average but want a porn star, but other than that, most average people do okay at any age I think as long as they go for people in a similar range to them.  

Edit: Fuck, you're an incel! *backs away slowly*

I understand now why you suddenly got so upset. You're used to being on TRP where you get your view of reality shaped and validated every day. But the problem is, it's a bunch of incels in an echo chamber. The world that regular people live in is completely different. And I could see why that would be extremely jarring, if TRP is comforting to you. It's like the anger of little kids who are told Santa isn't real.

It sucks that the idea of other people's pain is comforting to you. (The idea of women being in emotional pain.) So I can't say I feel bad that you were triggered by being confronted with reality. 

Since you're comforted by the idea of women being in emotional pain, I hope spending your time in the echo chamber / fantasy world of TRP is enough for you, that you don't feel the need to go out with a vehicle and run people over. 

If you ever have a moment of self-awareness you should realize TRP works very much like a fundamentalist religion. It attracts lost, powerless people. It sells a comforting, simple, black-and-white dogma to its followers, tells them that only they understand the real truth, gives them an identity they feel proud of, and promises future happiness and success to those who conform. Look at how you reacted with sheer rage at the idea that your comforting dogma isn't actually true. Then you guys go out and murder people. 

I would say I hope that one day, you don't need to cling to an artificial fundamentalism to feel okay about life, but I don't actually care if you do or not. I think that incels are mostly sadists and I don't think that's a thing that really changes. ","dyf646z",6,1525404611,"2018-05-04 03:30:11"

"1316","At the risk of being a wet blanket, I wouldn't dismiss a doctor's opinion just because you don't like it. It is very easy to self-diagnose and start seeing things that might not be there, which is why I never went on ADHD forums in the period between my GP suggesting it and my official diagnosis. Self-tests are also not the best way to determine a problem because according to those I test positive for ADHD, disassociative identity disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar. Without realising it, people exaggerate what they select in self-tests because they're so desperate for an answer they wind up believing they have something they haven't.

There are many reasons why you are currently struggling in this new setting, and ADHD may or may not be one of them. There is a reason why there is such an emphasis on evidence during childhood, because ADHD is a long-term disorder which becomes apparent at a young age. Yes you can argue that there are smart kids who get by and then falter after a certain age, but in a lot of situations there should have been some other reason to push for an assessment.

I'm not saying this to discourage you or make you feel silly, however depending on where you live you could spend large sums of money and may not even get the answer you're looking for. Of course her attitude was wrong though, just because someone isn't literally imitating a rampant rabbit doesn't mean they don't have it. Like the others have said, definitely get a second or even third opinion, and don't be too discouraged if they don't give you the answer you want. You don't have to have ADHD to not be lazy, remember that.

I'm sorry for the unpopular opinion, I'm just worried you could potentially waste a lot of time and money, and find yourself in a situation where you're still not getting better with no idea why.","cx84817",10,1448126963,"2015-11-21 17:29:23"

Is there any research out on sensory overload as to whether you and others who suffer from both intensifies it due to double dipping? I’d certainly be curious to find out. I guess I’d probably assume no. However, you probably have more triggers for it... 

It is pretty awful though! Not sure how you acquired your PTSD and what other triggers it carries with it, but believe it or not, there can be positives to sensory sensitivity if you open yourself up to them. In situations where it’s not in complete overload, that same sensitivity gives us a special feel for life that most can’t experience. We are open to to stimuli that those without aren’t, simply because they aren’t aware of it. A few years ago I decided to embrace my ADD and read a lot to fully understand it. It allows me to be much more present and cognizant of what’s going on around me. Sensory overload sucks, but it can be a mixed bag.

* See above.

**Have you and your spouse had to make any adjustments in your marriage in order to deal with ADHD?**

"1373","I've got ADHD and Aspergers. My ADHD has influenced my progress at uni and my Aspergers influences my social relationships. I've got severe ADHD, cant really stay focussed and my mind drifts to a billion places. It's to the point I sometimes get dissociated. My meds help me stay focussed but the come down forces me into even worse dissociation at times. 
About my Aspergers, I'm usually at a neutral emotional state, even with stuff that seems to upset people or make others laugh. It's very hard to move me from that. Usually I just don't get whats so funny that it needs a laughing out loud reaction. Im horrible at genuine emotional reciprocation cause I usually honestly just don't feel it, but I know the rules of the game and I'm a great imitator so I can get away with it. I mainly only know how to be interested in stuff I care about, but it differs from person to person. I care greatly about my mom and my brother, and I could genuinely listen while interested to stuff they have to say, or laugh with them about something. Besides those things, some patterns make me really upset and panicked, I'm very sensitive to certain sounds and I don't like being surrounded by people. The sight of some patterns or hearing certain sounds sometimes upsets me to the point I can only deal with the emotional distress by hurting myself (not excessively, and not with any tools. Imagine more like clenching my fists etc. I'm fully aware it's a weird reaction but it helps) as it distracts me and calms me down. It doesn't happen very often.

Keep your chin up, chances are they will see your past diagnosis of ADHD and take it into consideration. Or so I have been assuming and hoping for myself. I was also diagnosed at age 6 and treated until I was 14, then came anxiety, depression, self esteem issues, anger issues, relationship issues, trouble relating to other people, chronic boredom, impatience, prone to violence, etc for a while I started thinking it was bipolar but I retraced back to when it started going downhill and it narrowed in to about a year after being taken off meds.

PS Good luck with everything regardless of turn out. I wish you the best of fortune in finding a solution :)

Edit: Also what did they make you do and how well do you think you did?

"1387","That's unfortunate. I don't know the details of the US health care system, but I had always assumed (actually, hoped is probably more accurate) that as long as you were on your parents plan, you could access services that you need. How do doctors get around confidentiality when you are dependent on an insurance plan? Sorry, totally not the point of this post :P

I know for me, things only fell apart in university. In high school, I was constantly told that I was lazy and undisciplined, but I managed to get pretty decent grades despite never turning anything in. Once I lost the structure, it became pretty obvious that I had ADHD.  I had a ton of anxiety when it came to actually seeing a counselor though because I assumed they would think that I was just looking for stimulants, like a typical college kid. I also wasn't convinced that I actually had it. I'm 30 now, but what finally motivated me to do something about it a few years ago was this article. http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/features/adhd-in-women#1. I can guarantee you that if you go on to college or university, especially if you go away for school, this will become much more difficult to manage.

My husband always teased me about being forgetful and very ADD-like, but one day he came across the article and felt that it described me perfectly. It was like a lightbulb went on. 

When I finally got an appointment with a psychiatrist, I came with a list of examples from different areas of my life to highlight how this was affecting me, and made sure to include stories from when I was a kid. After evaluation, his reaction was that it was amazing that this had not been diagnosed sooner and wasn't really sure how I managed to get through most of my 20's.  

Basically, this is a long-winded way of saying to show your parents articles, and talk about your experiences and **provide examples**. It's likely that one (or both) suffer from similar symptoms so they may be reluctant to acknowledge that it is a real thing that is affecting you. Also, they likely have a bit of a warped perception of you (in a positive way). When I was diagnosed, I told my mom and she said that it was impossible as I am super organized, have a great memory and can proceduralise anything! Both my husband and I started laughing, and I politely reminded her how messy my room was when I lived with her, and how the week before when we went shopping I had to go back home three times with her in the car because the first time, I forgot my wallet, the second time I forgot my purse, and the third time I forgot to lock the door.

But more to the point, participating in a class gives me structure and motivation in a good way. 

Aikido is pretty fast-paced at our dojo: we practice one thing for a few minutes, then we switch partners and try it again, maybe stop for some general pointers and then switch and continue... 

Plus we get to throw one another around on mats - and hard sometimes too! I love the smashing!!!

That is what is most fun about it for me - it's like play-fighting but we never get hurt and nobody ever gets pissed off!

These are things for your doctor to consider.

Doctors have an obligation to confirm the diagnosis for themselves. Your previous records help paint the picture of your history and continued difficulties. New ADHD diagnoses should be scrutinized because the prescriptions are frequently sought after by those that do not have ADHD.

You have ADHD. It will be clear from the TOVA. Anxiety will not improve your score. The TOVA isn't the only thing to use for diagnosis anyway. If the doctor isn't helpful then see a different doctor.

My intelligence meant I could breeze through things fast enough no one ever noticed, until suddenly I couldn't, and then I couldn't do anything at ALL. Most smart folks with ADHD have some super bizarre coping mechanisms, along with massive baggage on the topic too, depending on when diagnosis happened. 

I genuinely wish I had dropped out. I wasn't diagnosed yet and finished college but it was horrific. I had always thought I was so smart, everyone told me I was, I never had to really try, it was just easy, and then it got hard, and I tried all the Study things, and it was impossible. The easiest things were suddenly impossible, and because things required real retention, I was so screwed. My upper level math classes would just disappear in my head even though I was trying so hard to listen and take notes and it would just be... gone. I barely graduated, had a horrific internship that drove every bit of impostor syndrome deeper, I decided I was just an idiot who had gotten lucky and ran out of luck. Got a job at a cafe, went to trade school a year later to be a massage therapist after getting a bachelor's in math from a top university and working for NASA for a summer. (Still a massage therapist, by the way, and it was 1000000000% the right decision.)

&gt; The reason I ended up getting a diagnosis and am now medicated is that I relied on stress and pressure as my ""fuel"" to get things done. Like, I said I would deliver in 2 weeks and I'm 2 days before, so now it had to be done now. That led me to a complete meltdown/burnout and I was no longer able to do anything for a year after that. It's like my brain totally shut off, releasing all the pressure. Whoops.

Literally, like, all of your post is me, down to how I got work done and how I got by with the things I DIDN'T get done. I got diagnosed because my overwhelming symptom was apathy, burnout, and depression that wasn't depression but was totally depression but no one GOT it until a friend of mine with ADHD gently suggested it when I described locking myself in rooms in college with my textbooks for 10 hours of literal sobbing, only to not have it done, or setting timers to study and finding myself in another part of the house wondering why an alarm was going off?

By the time I was diagnosed, I could only function with panic, so everything had to be panic. I was burnt out and done. My brain had shut down, period. Psych described it as a computer: if you have to overclock and overheat to do any basic tasks, you're fucked when it gets harder. The brain just stops. It just can't DO any more and it's used it all up, so it's just DONE.","d9axck4",3,1477622754,"2016-10-28 02:45:54"

"1456","I appreciate most of this post, but I think you’re painting with brush strokes so broad that even Bob Ross would question it, and that’s particularly dangerous when you’re dealing with something as sensitive as calling people lazy.

&gt;	Non-ADHD procrastination (laziness) is me saying “I’m just not doing it (right now).” It means I’m out enjoying my life. I’m putting off my work until the last minute because I just don’t care about it. I’ll spend my night playing video games or spending time with my SO, and then wake up early to do my homework. The work is not a stressor. It’s not a priority.

Many people with ADHD can’t focus on something until it becomes an emergency. It’s not a question of laziness, it’s a matter of having the executive function required to get something done before it technically has to get done. I don’t think people who have this problem should be branded “lazy” just because they choose to do things they enjoy—and in some cases *the only things they can focus on right then*—rather than wracking themselves with guilt. You’re making the distinction based on intention, and I think that’s partly accurate, but you’re putting far too much stock on how shitty people make themselves feel rather than whether or not the end result differs. It doesn’t.

&gt;	Laziness does not feel guilty. I just don’t care about the task. I go out and enjoy my life and barely think about the task beyond a passing thought of “I should probably get started on that...”

Again, this is close, but you’re (ironically) forgetting that a core component of ADHD is forgetfulness. Something a passing thought is all we get before we’re lost to everything else happening in our lives and brains. Forgetfulness isn’t laziness, especially when it has a neurological basis, which is exactly what’s happening with ADHDers. And again you seem to think people who “enjoy [their] live[s]” are just lazy rather than living with ADHD.

&gt;	Tl;dr: ADHD procrastination is a cycle of anxious, frustrating, hugely effortful attempts and failures to begin and finish work that is important to you. Laziness is putting off unwanted tasks and enjoying life in the meantime. [...] I hope this helps people figure out the difference :)

Your description of “ADHD procrastination” is helpful. But I think you’re rushing to call people lazy when there could very well be alternative explanations to the problem. This dichotomy could be totally accurate to you, and if that’s the case, I’m glad you’re self-aware enough to work out these differences. Outside those experiences, it seems like you’d benefit from a bit more empathy and consideration for people who experience their ADHD brains differently.

Oh, and the “I hope this helps people figure out the difference :)” might be well-intentioned, but it comes off as smug. (Especially from a 21-year-old who was only recently diagnosed.) It usually helps to approach the impartment of wisdom with humility rather than with the feeling that you have all the answers. It’s not my intention to discourage you from sharing your thoughts—just that you consider approaching that sharing with more empathy and humility. I’d also consider interrogating why it seems like escaping guilt, which is such a painful and near-constant aspect of many ADHDers’ experience, leads you to think negatively about some of these folks. Being kind to yourself is vital.","ejevqgq",1,1553604524,"2019-03-26 12:48:44"

"1461","Hey, thanks for the response.

I guess I automatically assumed that the amphetamines were the cause in some shape or form, as it is listed as a side effect. Especially because, according to that article, it seems like tics most commonly develop in childhood, and typically reduce in severity in late teens/early adulthood. I started getting them (infrequently) when I was 22. It's a little scary, actually, to imagine that it could be something I haven't even thought of. I really just want it to go away, and now I'm worried that it might be something else that I might not be able to fix.

I think I'm going to call my general practitioner on Monday and schedule an appointment (although I won't be able to get one until the new year). If it does end up not being a side effect of my meds, then she can hopefully recommend the best course of treatment. I also plan on meeting with my psychiatrist as soon as possible and will bring it up with him in addition to discussing non-stimulant medication.","ce6rnc6",1,1387590418,"2013-12-21 01:46:58"

"1464","You are an adult now, so it's up to you.  Here's a basic action plan.

1. Find someone doing T.O.V.A. testing in your area.  Typically they are done in places that diagnose/address a wide range of developmental issues.  Take the test.  Get the results.

2. Make an appointment with a psych early enough so it's within a week or two of getting your test results back.  The easiest path is Typically the place with TOVA testing refers out to local psychiatrists.

3. Go to the psych and discuss your options.   IMO, a good psych spends some time talking about your life situation much more than a 10-minute assessment, then prescription type medical care factory. 

I know plenty of people here get their meds from a general practitioner.  If you can afford a psychiatrist, I suggest going that route.

Post any other follow-up questions.  Plenty of people here besides me with experience to help.

ADHD-ers need to ‘feel the fear’ before we can take on a boring AF task like this!

Seriously though, you could try making it into a game where you have 1 ‘challenge’ to complete each day... maybe like this:

1) gather all the supplies you need (boxes - at least twice as many as you think you’ll need, box tape, marker pens, trash bags, newspapers/bubble wrap etc)

2) trash / recycle / donate anything you can see that you definitely don’t need to take with you

3) pack a suitcase / box with everything you need to live for the first week (including any tools and cleaning products you will need to rebuild your furniture)

4) set a timer for an hour and power through packing one room - it doesn’t matter if the items are mixed up - they’re all going to the same room in your new place - write the room on the boxes. Bonus points if you also write the items on each box. Mark the box ‘F’ if any of the contents is fragile / breakable

5) repeat challenge 4 until all items are in the boxes (also consider heavy duty trash bags for items like bedding - just don’t mix these up with the actual trash!)

6) take apart any furniture that is flatpack - put the fittings in a small clear bag and write the name of the item on it. Tape the bag to a piece of the furniture they belong too

7) sit an marvel at your awesomeness 😊

"1502","It is *way* too early to be feeling down about not going to the gym if you're only in your first week of Vyvanse.  Amphetamines are going to have appetite suppression initially in nearly every patient.  I suggest waiting eight (8) weeks at the very minimum before determining if your appetite is truly being negatively affected by Vyvanse.

When I took Vyvanse, I felt great and focused at first, but nauseous and yucky.  After awhile though, my appetite almost became *better* than normal (that's good for a 125 lb 23 yo male) and I still retained all the benefits of Vyvanse.

I enjoy lifting and swim about three (3) miles a week, so I strongly recommend waiting it out. I understand you might feel down about not exercising at first (I did), but try to focus on both developing a new routine and adjusting to Vyvanse right now.

It's good that you feel this way though!  It shows that you're passionate about the gym.  So if you're passionate about working out, picking it back up is going to be easy and exciting once you determine how Vyvanse affects your personal schedule.

Just stick it out for now. :)

As for improving your appetite, try to switch up tastes.  That's what I did.  I never ate the same thing everyday at first and usually alternated between water and sugar-free sports drinks or sugar-free carbonated beverages.  I've personally found that I'm more apt to eat if I know I'll be getting a different flavor or texture of food/drink with every meal/snack.","ch0h660",3,1398305515,"2014-04-24 02:11:55"

When I was “diagnosed” as a kid, it was based on a few conversations with a shrink. Some guy with a checklist, asking if I had trouble concentrating, etc. And throughout the 90s and 00s, I often read that ADHD was a disproportionately American phenomenon perpetuated by big pharma. In any case, for me as a teen and a young adult, it was easier to decide I didn’t have a disorder.

But as I said, I didn’t know there was more to ADHD than concentration issues and general scatterbrain until recently. And apparently the testing has changed; another commenter mentioned MRI tests, which sounds a lot more precise.

That said, there are a lot of posts and comments on this sub that indicate many people are primarily thinking of themselves as disabled, and attributing a lot of normal human behavior to ADHD. My point is that if I had grown up believing I had ADHD, I may have done the same thing, and I don’t think that would have been good for me.","es1i325",1,1561497313,"2019-06-25 21:15:13"

"1543","Absolutely. Different tasks have different demands. Your situation seems like it would be the type a booster could resolve. If your psychiatrist won't budge, there are a few options you could consider. Vyvanse works well for me, and it seems to provide long-lasting consistency. If you've tried multiple meds before, your insurance might allow a prior authorization, and there's a coupon on the Vyvanse website that can bring the cost down to $30, up to a $60 discount I believe. You could also try adding an adjunct. Clonidine and guanfacine mostly work for hyperactivity, but it's possible that adding one of them could reduce impulsivity (guanfacine generally causes less sedation than clonidine, especially in the form of Intuniv). You might be able to ask to combine it with Strattera so that you have a consistent background effect. You might also be able to ask for a different class as a booster, like Ritalin IR or Wellbutrin IR.","dli7602",1,1502506436,"2017-08-12 02:53:56"

"1562","The people saying the same things over and over again but rewording it... I got better about that when I figured out WHY people do that.


They have impulses to do things just like us... but to them they are subtle. So while we have a drill instructor of an impulse telling us to GO GO GO do this then that want a thingy! They have a low background hum that they sort of learned to follow around and they generally get satisfaction.

So if your mother asks you to take out the trash, but it's your sibling's turn and they are not home... she may hang around and talk about the trash not being out for the next 15 minutes. The impulse,for her, is ""the trash stinks it should go out. So things like it not being your task are less important and the low murmur (reptile brain) still wants it gone so it keeps whispering. She feels no satisfaction (a very uncomfortable and alien feeling to a neurotypical) and thus your rebuff of being told to take the trash out shifted her from actively asking to an unintentional passive asking. 

All that she wants is that impulse to be satisfied. So you can speak up over the murmur and probably be called rude (despite the fact you have for the last 15 minutes been ignored about how it isn't your problem ahe is just making it your problem) or you can redirect her. Mention and play up the sibling... the reptile brain isn't very bright so if you say something like ""Yeah where is that lazy sibling, they should have taken the trash out before they left!"" that might dislodge them or you can shift it back to mother via wording ""Boy the sibling-o-matic is gone, how are you going to solve the trash problem?!"" and subtly shift the problem needing solved right back on them. 

Being ADHD makes you introspective... sometimes by force. Use that on other people and try to guide them into a more bearable existence for yourself.","gr7xmib",1,1615972919,"2021-03-17 09:21:59"
"1563","Preface- I hit the cancel button, but I had intended to hit save. Yay, I get to write this post again.

My brain still creates more stories than I will ever use when I'm on meds, but I have trained my mind over the years to ""stay in the same universe"". What I mean by that is this: Pick a place and time period. Create a series of laws all within that universe must adhere by. Create a series of higher laws very few people are aware of- and even fewer can work with. 

This way my mind creates a lot of smaller sub stories within my novel rather than something so different it may as well live in what ever mass big enough to exist out side out our visible universe.

That metaphor is not hyperbole. When I was not on my meds I would write a story about intergalactic supercomputers taking over the minds of humans when some neuron starts talking to another and BAM! Que gen one pokemon battle music, a wild teenage gender swap story with a focus on drug abuse vs compassion for people with drug addictions has appeared!  

What will u/myothersockismissing do?

I will say OH MINE! write few pages, maybe go into hyper focus for an hour or two, then play minecraft when something breaks my focus.    

Now, those smaller stories come about more organically. My novel draft has at least two major plot points that go no where, but if I was to remove them ( I shall) and use them for another story ( I may, in time) they can bloom into another full story.

Pre-meds I would write out a main story, but also work on short stories in that same universe. One of my stories that topped out at 70 ish pages has a collection of short stories that explains why the main girl is a bad ass demon hunter- and I have another novel length story about a girl who ends up going into a side realm then becomes a great fairy. 

I wonder if my super changed creative mind is the same feeling of being an 11/10 woman. I like to be creative, but damn it! I do not want to be so creative it ruins my ability to harness my creative energy.  

Training my brain to live in the one working universe I am writing in took about 10 years. ugh High School 0/10 will not do that again ( The irony of that statement is not lost on me, for I now work in that same high school).  I did learn one thing in the few fun creative writing classes I had taken: remove your self from your work. 

As a writer, my protagonists are not a self insert avatar for myself or my reader. My poems are not from my voice- they are from the speaker's of the poem voice. Your songs are just that. They may have an origin within your head but the 14 year old covering Ron Popes ""A Drop In The Ocean"" is nether Pope nor is that song his anymore. She puts her own spin, emotions, and effort into that cover. It might sound 5.3 x 10^45 times worse than the original song- and that is fine. The voice of the song is depicted  as a new voice.

What I am trying to say is this: Use your emotions to create, weave, polish, and preform your work, but do not let your work be so mush on an extension of your past that they become intertwined. You create the voice of a song. It is an entity onto itself .Nothing more. Nothing less.

Meds have helped me out a lot. The difference with my output is now about as different as a sunset is to an albino American Woodcock. However, they are not magic. There are always days where I forgo working on my novel and sleep off a bad day- or write overly long posts on reddit with the Minecraft launcher open in the background. On my good days, I can write for 4-5-some times 6 hours at a time.

Just reading the title my response is... ""But I don't wanna talk about morning routines!"" I hate mornings. Ha! I seriously, deeply loathe mornings. Mornings routines have been a thorn in my side my entire life and I'm currently in the ""screw mornings"" stage. 

And in response to the first paragraph... I know, RIGHT?!?!?! I've done all that stuff and it takes me like 3 hours and that's if I rush through it all. And that's supposed to be BEFORE I even start my day?! Id have to get up at 4:30! in the morning to do all that before my kids go up wanting breakfast. And waking up pretty much any time before 9 makes me want to cry. 6:00 was my goal for a long time and I did okay at it, but then I found I was so tired and mad about being awake that I often couldn't get anything done anyway. I was just staring off into space or falling asleep wherever I may be. 

I have written down my perfect routine over a dozen times. I keep coming back to it and it's like seeing it from the other side of a glass wall. If I could just form ONE habit at a time, I might actually get there some day, but I don't have the patience for that. 

I'm currently in the process of ""sucking it up"" and writing down all the tiny habits I want to form that would make my life better so I can work on them one at a time.

Also, setting timers on your phone if you have one is a really good way to remind yourself.

I didn't learn about ADHD until I was 39 and I'd actually gotten to a pretty sustainable place with my mental health so it kind of threw me for a loop to consider there might actually be an Answer when I'd already resigned myself to never knowing. 

Here's how I was coping before I got my diagnosis: self-compassion. I'd do my best, know my limits, promise to keep pushing myself a little outside my comfort zone, but not too far, and then forgive myself if I failed. I stopped comparing myself to other people. 

I had a million coping strategies for not forgetting the Really Important Stuff but mostly I was learning to cut myself slack if I screwed up. I was resigned to being friends with the people who could tolerate my long periods of silence. (As it turns out... those are some of the best friends I could ever have.)

Therapy depending who you are (didnt do shit for me, but i knew what i needed to do to be better). I got into these habits, broke them, and would get back into them when my life unraveled. Covid broke them long term and i got on meds again for the first time in a decade. Slowly im getting back into them with the help of adhd meds to break the haze, and it took months to find the correct meds. Adderall made me too unable to leave bed on the days i didnt take it, caused mood swings and left me hyper-seeking stimulation when it wore off. Dexedrine barely did anything but had less side effects and turned me into a robot when i increased the dosage. Vyvanse helps tremendously for me but may be inaccessible due to cost as it was to me before a couple weeks ago when i aquired new insurance.

Point is, i was exactly where you were 6 months ago, but everything is temporary and you need to exhaust every tool at your disposal before giving up even when shits seems bad. Even happiness is temporary. Most days im just alright. Im learning to appreciate the days or even moments when im more than alright though. This mostly comes from the practice of meditation. Headspace has a good structure and courses and a series on netflix that covers the fundamental. I tried calm before that but didnt find it as concise but i need more structure to learn better since im poor at organization.

It sounds like your doctor nailed the dosage, honestly. Your expectations are more in line with the Reddit bro-science view of stimulants than actual therapeutic treatment of ADHD. Keep in mind that therapeutic stimulant treatment is nothing like what happens when people abuse stimulants without a prescription for study binges and such. The euphoria and unsustainable motivation boosts aren't what stimulants are supposed to do long-term. Instead, they're supposed to tip the scales in your favor by increasing your concentration abilities and reducing distractibility. And that's exactly what happened here.

"1633","First understand ADHD is a wide spectrum disorder. Many people have similarities in their problems, but not everyone's problems are the same. 

In terms of issues being late, I think a 5 minute grace is fair. ADHD can legitimately cause problems with remembering things you need for work, until you're in the car, ready to go...then *fuuuck I have to run inside and grab xyz*. That can, and has made me 5 minutes late when I was ready to go on time, even *early* but my memory betrayed my hopes and dreams. 

Sometimes this is impossible, and for extreme reasons a person *has* to be at work on the dot. In that case, explain this, sternly with tact. Often, consequences help people with ADHD get their shit together. 

As for lacking drive when working, I'm not sure to be honest. For me, personally, I was raised to work hard. However, what I will add to that is sometimes even in my determination to be 100% mentally there on the job, the occasional space out/daydream is uncontrollable. 

He may not realize that he's not being as driven as you expect either. You may want to clue him on that and see if it helps. Make your expectations clear, they may need to be repeated.

Rather, the medicine just removes the roadblocks that adhd places in front of you, allowing you to choose to focus. So I think you need to work on self discipline along with the medication. Really work on setting up systems that will help you focus, look at what time of day you’re most productive and schedule important projects during that time.

"1658","Having recently been placed on Dexamfetamine, seeing this documentary just made me feel upset for two reasons. Because of the light in which those taking medication are shown and how I know I used to view those who were prescribed ADHD medication. 

I always thought it was the meds that made them smarter, harder working and more ambitious. I was so miss guided. A few months into taking the meds and I realise it’s not the meds entirely, it’s what you do when you take them. In my case I always have been ambitious but lacked the ability to stay on a linear path in perusing those goals. Now, I can. But again, it’s with the ASSISTANCE of the meds not the meds themselves. I feel like a vail of distraction has been lifted and I can really view the world and my life for what it is. 

Tied in with seeing this doco. It just feels like its fear mongering around this medication that is so beneficial to those with ADHD in assisting them reach their potential if the meds are the kick start needed.
Hearing these Uni students talk is saddening, they are abusing a drug that has the potential for abuse and in doing so making it look as if those whom take it with purpose are also abusing it. Which as a side not is why it’s a CONTROLLED SUBSANCE which any one who is prescribed would know. On your script it has re-fill dates which if you come in early is marked down and you can have your medication reduced or taken away should it appear that you’re abusing it.

I am not ashamed to tell people I have ADHD and take medication however I am weary as there is a stigma attached to it which isn’t helped by Documentaries such as this one.

None of my report cards really talked about difficulty with attention, since my teachers were much more concerned with my difficulty socialising and my severe anxiety. I could almost have been diagnosed based on report cards alone with OCD and Asperger's syndrome. What annoys me the most is that my teachers were raising concerns about the aforementioned conditions since I began school, but it took a decade for my parents to finally take any action.

I was diagnosed with ADHD after graduating high school but before starting university. I was evaluated bya psychologist, who administered an IQ test (which showed a massive discrepancy between my full scale IQ (99th percentile) and my processing speed (around the 40th percentile) and working memory (near the 70th)). Between that and some of the questionnaires given to me, my psychologist and psychiatrist felt confident enough to make the diagnosis.

I was able to compensate for untreated ADHD with my above average intelligence and my extreme perfectionism. There was, however, a noticeable discrepancy between my test scores (which were all perfect or nearly perfect) and my marks on projects (which were lower and lower the more the project relied on effort and time management, rather than raw intellect). Because of my hatred for all things social, I never talked out of turn in class, so none of my teachers thought I was disruptive. The fact that I zoned out in most classes didn't bother any of my teachers, since I was still able to get the top test scores in the class.","d4u0vha",6,1467298922,"2016-06-30 15:02:02"

"1678","I wholeheartedly agree with the points you bring up. As a (only marginally related but bear with me) side thought in relation to your edit: if a child is not experiencing distress or negative effects from ADHD, does it even qualify as ADHD? For it to truly deserve its final D, to be a disorder, doesn't it have to cause problems in several parts of your life? 

At least, this is what my therapist told me when diagnosing me - that they only give the diagnosis if the disorder causes 'enough' distress in several areas of someone's life, otherwise it's not a disorder and therefore not ADHD (here in the Netherlands that's a normal way to handle this because of fear of over-diagnosing). So even if someone who is not experiencing thát much distress from it would want treatment, they couldn't get it at all - since there's no diagnosis. 

Luckily my ADHD was severe enough to 'deserve' a diagnosis and therefore treatment (which has helped me tremendously) but what if my troubles had been a little less, not meeting the requirements and therefore not being able to benefit from medication? One of the rare instances that I was glad for the (sufficient) severity of my condition.

"1718","I think both CBT for him and relationship counseling for the two of you would be helpful. 

I'm concerned with your example:

-He assumes that it's your obligation to help him clean up a mess he made. It's not. 

-He doesn't ask you himself, expecting you to offer. He then gets upset when you don't read his mind. 

-He assumes that you are intentionally trying to disrespect him - making negative judgments about your character and then immediately acting on these assumptions. 

These are toxic attitudes in any relationship, and if they are a regular pattern then it's something you should deal with. 

ADHD (and most mental illness) is an explanation, not an excuse. There are some things we do not do as well as other people, and it's our obligation to find ways to compensate, not your obligation to put up with it. 

Emotional flooding can be controlled if -he- is willing to work on it. And this doesn't just mean ""trying harder"" but finding different ways of approaching it. A counselor would help him immensely here.","cv58fln",5,1442530127,"2015-09-17 22:48:47"

https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/55pklh/anyone_read_adhd_nation_by_alan_schwarz/

In that post in some of my replies I quoted part of a chapter dealing with media and ADHD stigma done by one of the leading ADHD Researchers.  A large amount of the chapter (the stuff I quoted) deals with the NYT in articles and op eds over a 2 year period.

Note Dr. Stephen Hinshaw is a highly respected ADHD researcher (equal to Dr. Barkley in the ADHD research community) but he is a more conservative researcher which believes in some school districts and some counties of the US we may have ADHD overdiagnosis.  In fact the book I quoted deals with this for ADHD diagnosis is not close to heterogeneous / universal around the US, not by states, not by income, but due to other things it is more likely certain school districts and counties have a higher diagnosis of ADHD prevalence.

Note Dr. Hinshaw even though he is a more conserative ADHD researcher big issue besides ADHD research, is Stigma about how people treat mental illness and childhood developmental disorders, and he is very big in combating Stigma.","d8pnp43",17,1476321885,"2016-10-13 01:24:45"

The great part about the patch is that it takes effect in about 20 minutes, and stops pretty quickly once it's removed.  If he didn't need the afterschool help, he could skip it; if so, he could wear it to get through soccer and homework, remove it for dinner, and have a normal bedtime.

Sorry to hear about your doctor.  I had to change physicians to find one that would prescribe for ADHD.  My current one has written an RX for adderall - 45 tabs per month, which is 2.5 per day.  I usually skip the .5.

Another thought - is it possible to delay the taken the med in the morning?  One of the papers I read on relationships and ADHD points out that you should treat the time after work (with spouse and family, in my case) as just as important as the time at work.

It has done nothing for my procrastination problem in terms of getting started on stuff. Nothing.

When I get started on something that's boring I think I'm worse than ever at sticking to it. Used to be motivated by anxiety and fears of failure but now that I've had some therapy and am just more mature in general... Mandatory yet boring shit absolutely aches, man!

When I get started on something that I like I'm lasered-in to the point that I forget to drink water and eat until I'm pasty and exhausted. Not all the time, but more often since I started Vyvanse. 

Getting better at the harmony and rhythm of sustainable productivity but all too often I'll run into a friend or get a phone call when I go for a break or to the bathroom. Then my 20 min break turns into a 60 min one and I'm behind on time and my motivation expires too.

Really good growth and progress in social, work, family, love life and stuff but studying continues to really fuck with me.

- Consequently, that it's this person's fault for being something that he or she can't control

There's no deep-rooted history of systemic oppression. Yes, it's an insult, but you're not being reduced to a physical characteristic by people who haven't the *slightest* idea of who you are. These people do have an idea of who you are, because they're basing this insult on their perception of your actions. It may be misguided/wrong, but it doesn't strip you of your humanity.

So maybe you should reconsider, or at least avoid making this comparison to others IRL to avoid getting your ass beat.

Yes, I'm telling you to check your privilge (or intrinsic ignorance, or whatever).

Inb4 anyone getts butthurt on me, no I'm not debasing mental illness. Those, like the people that call ADHDers lazy, *also* need to check their privilege (or intrinsic ignorance, or whatever).

I'm not saying you're a jerk or anything, really. I'm just saying that people shouldn't presume to know one another's struggles when in reality they have no way of knowing what it's like. That's what people have done to you, so I get what you mean. And both you and anyone of any particular race cannot choose to have ADHD or to be black or whatever.

"1830","My son 12 years old, has had issues with anxiety in the past. He also has sensory issues, but not quite enough to be considered sensory processing disorder. It is pretty clear though that his anxiety and sensory issues are linked.

When he was your child's age, he would externalize a lot so he would throw fits, scream, or act extremely hyper when he got overwhelmed. He hated to get wet or have his clothes wet/damp and he really didn't even like to wear clothes at all (which he was only allowed to do at home.) He also is a picky eater although he's gotten a lot better, he wouldn't eat anything with a smooth texture like mashed potatoes, oatmeal, etc. A lot of times when a kid is acting anxious it's really because they're overwhelmed and that has always been the case for him. 

Now that he's older I try to empower him to make decisions that aren't too overwhelming so that he feels capable when he's in a situation that normally would cause him to shut down. He mostly gets anxious in loud noisy places, especially if he's tired or if he wasn't expecting the situation. Or if he is trying to focus on something and people are interrupting him.

Depending on where you live there may be an early intervention type of program through the school district or the county (in the US). Where I live they will evaluate your kid for free and then see what services they can offer. Since my son was considered subclinical, he didn't get any services. That was actually disappointing because he could definitely have benefited but he wasn't bad off enough I guess. I have some friends though that have gone through the same program and got into their kids occupational therapy and some special education services.

Other than that, it does help to give a lot of time for transitions. Another one of my children is very slow to transition and I give her 10, 5 and 2 minute warnings before a task is to be over. That helps a lot for her. Also I factor in about an extra 10 minutes just for her to get out the door because she can be so slow! 

Oh and another thing that has helped (sorry I know you didn't ask for parenting advice so feel free to ignore) is to talk about their feelings and explain how there are appropriate ways to express. Obviously a 3 y/o is not going to be able to completely control themselves right away but it helps to teach them young. My son knew if he was overwhelmed he could go in his bed and wrap up in a blanket-we would say he could ""go burrito"" lol.

I paced around hot water used the restroom stares blankly at pages grit my teeth . Would swing between frustration and depression. I have never been diagnosed either . My wife is a saint and helps me out more than anyone can reasonably expect of another person . I have tried multiple different general doctors for some reason I cannot find ya psychiatrist that will call back I’ve called a dozen. My doctors keep prescribing me odd things I’ve never heard of like “guanfacine”?? And bupropion . Guanfacine didn’t do anything so they had me up the dose to like 2mg if I recal I could be off. I did. After 2 weeks when I bent over I felt like I was going to fall down from it or pass out from light headed ness. The latter bupropion , after a week I got less feelings of frustration but no difference in attentiveness/productivity.

I remember feeling really anxious/nervous about it because I’ve heard such terrible things about stimulants and I had never taken one, so I honestly expected to feel like I was vibrating. 

But once it kicked in, I noticed that, for the first time that I could remember, my mind was *quiet*. I was able to just sit and enjoy watching a movie on the weekend, like a normal human, without the overwhelming spirals of what I didn’t accomplish at work the week before or really anything I could worry about. 

I felt way more confident in my abilities at work and it takes me less time to make decisions. I feel more confident speaking up and voicing my opinions and concerns at work, too, which has been really interesting to explore! 

So for me, it’s an immediate effect. BUT as my dose wears off, the anxiety does come back, and it is intense sometimes. If it’s really bad, I’ll just take a small dose of Xanax (.5 mg) and it does just enough to take the edge off.","ggls4u2",2,1608572474,"2020-12-21 17:41:14"

It hasn't caused me failure (yet) cause the self that I am, the self that I feel I truly am, has been able to fight it. yet, my ability to fight it weakened over time and I see now that for the past 4 years, adhd suppressed me instead of me suppressing it. when I read my diary through these past years, I see that I've repeatedly written that I don't feel like myself. I'm gonna show you an example of something I had written last year:

*I feel trapped, as if an unknown force is weighing me down, making me descend into the depths of somewhere that I don't want to be. I want to escape yet it feels like whatever curse has befallen me is making my will obsolete, as if what I want has no power in this dark cloudy universe that is imprisoning my mind. I am restless to fly yet my wings do not obey me, I am restless to be free yet I cannot clash with the claws of unknown. whatever it is, it wants me to be chained and powerless and it's succeeding.*

Now I know what this unknown force has been, yet I don't understand why I should see it as a part of me when this is how I have felt about it. I love myself, but I don't love this force. to see it as a permanent unwelcome guest that I have to overcome daily is much easier than accepting it as myself. I'm not disconnecting it from myself, it has been disconnected all along. my sense of self has been shaped throughout all these years, to accept it as myself is to uproot what I've always felt like I am so it is important for me to distinct it.

I don't shame adhd yet I don't necessarily see it as a good thing. I'm not ashamed to have it, I'm actually proud that I am where I am despite having these limits. it's like playing life on the hard mode. I think It's actually enjoyable to reach my goals while playing on the hard mode cause that would mean I have overcame some difficulties and that brings a greater sense of accomplishment.","ead24sg",1,1543071541,"2018-11-24 14:59:01"

At least you know your limitations. Those 'everything together moms' are fooling themselves if they think you don't need to watch kids near water.

Also... ADHD moms tend to have ADHD kids... so our kids need more watching! Fortunately, I hand out with moms who also have wanderers, so we're all comfortable breaking off conversation to find out why someone has suddenly disappeared.... and talking while keeping eyes on our kids....

But really the key is, in my experience, a lot of parents just don't WATCH their kids.  So they don't notice that little Tommy just bloodied my son's nose... or that I pulled their precious little Ferdinanda out of traffic.

"1864","I'm 39 here and have been diagnosed with Depression/Anxiety for 15 years but I basically fell apart after high school.  After years and years of going through CBT and treatment for depression/anxiety I finally happened upon some material on ADHD.  It fit like a glove... so here I am today on stimulants and doing much better. 

ADHD is much more than the common perception of hyperactivity.  From the sidebar...  

&gt; **ADHD-PI, Predominantly Inattentive** (previously ADD or ADHD-I): Characterized by a predominance of:
&gt; 
&gt; * forgetfulness
&gt; * disorganization
&gt; * inattentive to conversation
&gt; * fails to give attention to details
&gt; * etc...
&gt; 
&gt; **ADHD-PH, Predominantly Hyperactive (&amp; Impulsive)**
&gt; Characterized by a predominance of:
&gt; 
&gt; * excessive talking
&gt; * constantly interrupting people
&gt; * constant fidgeting
&gt; * trouble waiting their turn
&gt; * trouble participating in leisure activities quietly
&gt; * etc...
&gt; 
&gt; **ADHD-C, Combined**
&gt; Is assigned when the person exhibits a distribution of symptoms across the other types.
&gt; 
ADHD symptoms closely mimic lots of other mental disorders... and they can be comorbid, meaning you can have bipolar/anxiety/depression symptoms and still have ADHD.  

So, I had co-morbidity with anxiety and depression.  In fact, that was what allowed me to fly under the radar for 15 years.  I would get treatment and improve.. only to repeat this cycle several times.  What was happening was my untreated ADHD symptoms gave me social anxiety and lack of faith in myself, which made me fail (my ADHD symptoms punctuated my failures) which led to depression.. and as all these perceived failures stacked on top of each other I developed anxiety trying to cope with it all.  

Here is a video with Dr Russell Barkely who studies ADHD and has some fantastic insights into what it is and how it manifests in adult lives.

My observation is that my attention and motivation has declined, and maybe it's made worse with excessive context switching web-surfing and now smartphones. The reverse may be a solution

"1874","I would definitely try to bring it up less. A few basic problems here. 

1. ADHD is pretty stigmatized and misunderstood. It's unfortunate, but that's the way it is right now.  

2. It's hard for people to understand most problems/ things that haven't been through or experienced even if it wasn't stigmatized. (For example, it's hard for me to really understand the impacts of racism or OCD because I have never had to deal with those problems). Especially, I think, if someone has never experienced any mental illness, it's a lot harder for them to understand what that's like and the lack of control you can have over your own symptoms. 

3. Most people, unless you're really close, don't want to hear about any problem you have ""all the time"" or really often. Especially, if they can't help, it can just make them feel guilty.  Which people often (subconsciously) deal with by minimizing the problem or becoming bitter at you for constantly bringing it up.

I would stick to discussing it with those you're really close to or who have similiar problems. Also, talking on here can be helpful. It helps if you have a positive outlook when you do discuss it too (not like that its easy but like that you're determined to get through it versus just complaining), people are more sympathetic to that a lot of times.","eiatsrv",1,1552334473,"2019-03-11 20:01:13"
"1875","Both of those things should be fine, but everybody is different so you could try playing around with it. The big thing to avoid is anything really acidic or with citric acid, like orange juice, coke, coffee.

"1876","I do drug holidays. You build up a tolerance over time and the meds can seem a little less effective. For instance, I take it from Monday to Friday. By the time Friday rolls around I can tell that there is a difference. Mondays are always good though. 

Taking it every day can lead to you needing to increase dosage, which is something I try to avoid. I don't want to be totally dependant on these meds ","ct97g7l",1,1437355253,"2015-07-20 01:20:53"

Your professors aren't paid to judge you, they are paid to educate you. Your fellow students _should_ be at a disadvantage compared to somebody with numerous years of experience over them. There isn't anything wrong with that - school isn't a competition, so you aren't hurting anyone by doing everything you can (within ethical reason) to succeed at it.

Do this _for yourself_. Most of all, you owe it to yourself not to throw away the privilege you have been awarded. When you graduate, nobody else will care if it was ""fair"", but you will have to live with whether or not you did your best and/or are satisfied.

Before I was diagnosed and got medicated, I would wait until the last minute, but I would still get my things turned in.

Now of course, it's not pleasant to hear people you respect telling you that you're doing something ""wrong.""  When do they bring up the topic? Just on their own out of the blue, or does something cause them to bring it up, like seeing you take the meds, hearing about doctor appointment, etc?  Whatever makes them think about it, I would just make sure they aren't exposed to it, limiting their ability to talk about it. If they happen to bring it up, perhaps try saying, ""I'd rather not get into all that, we can talk about it another time"" and switch topics.  Hopefully if you show that you're uncomfortable talking about it, your friends and family will recognize that and not bring it up again or as often.

I was on the 18mlg pills and told to start with 1 but I could take 2 if 1 want enough. I took 1 the first day and 2 the second because that jitteryness was making programming pretty difficult, and I had thought it was from nerves not the Concerta.

Now I take 1 of the 54mlg pills in the morning. Only really just started taking daily as I had been forgetting every other day or so, then a whole 4-5 days before last sunday. Sure enough half an hour to an hour after taking it I feel like I've got enough energy to run straight up Mordor. It's thw whole reason I've started exercising again. When the jitters come on I either hop onto the treadmill or I come to Reddit. That's the whole reason I'm making this overall pointless comment!

To make it less pointless I'm gonna ask a question. I've noticed that it does wear off sometime in the afternoon, though I take it when I actually wake up, not when my alarm goes off so I can't time it so nicely. When it was wearing off for you did you feel like your ADHD was coming on stronger? I noticed it the other night.

Second, I’d suggest talking with your wife about what are the main triggers for her to feel such a way. Have an open and honest conversation and see where it leads. Also it may be in your best interest to learn more about ADHD; the symptoms, the effects it has for the individual, as well as how your brain works, because though she may be neurotypical, you are not. All of that can give the both of you a clearer idea of what’s going on and how to handle the situations that arise.

"1930","I had an interesting conversation with my psychatrist last night. I told her that since I've finished my MA I've been using less adderal. I dont need it all the time so why take it? The adderall gives me more energy than I know what to do with so I do keep that in mind when deciding to take it or not.   
She asked me how I am doing with staying on task, etc. I told her that I use tons of lists, post-its, alarms, outlook, onenote, etc. I said that I need reminders to work while i'm at work (thank you so much for being in my life, Outlook). I also told her that I have sticky notes all over the house to remind me of stuff (It seems like I am single-handedly keeping PostIt in business, lol) . I also write on my bathroom mirror with dry erase markers.   
She looked at me for a bit and said, ""wouldnt it be just easier to take the adderal?""  


Lady. Her of all people should know that if I take it, I can get *hyper focused*  on one task. Even if I buckle down and pound out some solid work, withouth an alarm that says to move from one report to the other, I'll stay on the one all damn day. I can even get hyper focused on distractions. Facebook? Yup, accidentally wasted an hour on it. Choosing a podcast or radio station? Whoops there goes another hour.

I felt fine for the first month or two( definitely had moments where I couldn’t get anything done and I didn’t have a lot of responsibilities then either) But a few more months into it, I had anxiety and feeling depressed and I didn’t have my adhd doc to go to since I was in a different state.

"1963","My advice as a life coach - be extremely picky and cautious with who you pick. 

A life coach should possess these four things: 

(1) be honest about the services they provide to clients
(2) be someone who asks the right questions; so you get the right answers
(3) be a coach who empowers you to believe in yourself; helping you break through weaknesses, and barriers.
(4) be there to help recreate you, to the best possible, you. 

I’m a life coach and also have 14yrs experience in network marketing. I coach a method only 2% of Network Marketers use; why? Because only 2% of Network Marketers are getting paid 6 or 7 figure incomes. I’m also someone who has used life coaches in the past. None of which actually helped me. What makes me different to most is I can resonate with where most are. I spent 11 years going through failures; 11 years staying a victim; instead of becoming a victor. The struggle is real!! 

I’m also an artrepreneur - a creative who has no limitations on what I can create. I am a multi-disciplinary artist. 

Did you know Oprah has used the same life coach for the past 30 years? Her name is Martha Beck! Sometimes even the most wealthiest need a little guidance. 

I have two coaching programs - both 30 days. Or, I offer FREE consultations and then an hourly or fixed rate, thereafter. 

I have come from where you sit now. I had no idea what to do, where to look, how to start, or how to brand myself! There is a way out. 🦋

My parents would turn the light off before they went to bed after i had fallen asleep. Often i would still be awake and they would have to leave it on all night.

Martial arts gave me the confidence that i could overcome my imaginary foes, and i eventually rationalized that there's no more in the room with the light off than when it's on. From that point on i never needed the light, literally one day i just turned the lights out to my parents surprise. I actually came to despise any source of light at night time...

I also had headaches and it turned out i needed glasses, I had been straining my eyes trying to read in school leading to intense headaches.

"1986","A friend of my fathers dropped by recently when I was back home, with a PC. He asked whether I could remove two HDDs and place them in two usb drive cases he bought. It happened, that there was a packaging error in one of them, and a power connector for SATA was missing (there was one for molex only). Normally I'd just recommend (and I did)  replacing the unit with seller, but I wasn't going to be around for some time, and he hoped to have it done that day. So I grabbed a spare molex-SATA connector (which I wasn't able to use as it wouldn't fit in the drive case), took SATA connector out, and replaced it on the provided cable. It took some effort as I had to strip cable and basically jury-rig the thing, but I got it to work.

"1999","Diagnosed at 32, I've been dealing with this very issue.

My entire school life was summed up by the repeated statement ""You're so smart, you have so much potential, you just need to focus and put the work in!""  

I couldn't focus.  I could learn in class -- I'd listen to the teacher while also reading the textbook -- but I never could get homework done.  As a result, I had a 32 on the ACT but a 2.4 GPA.  I struggled through college with the same issues, and now that I was responsible to get myself to classes I started having trouble actually making it to them and attending.  Again, GPA slipped.

After school, my work life was a long series of temp jobs where I'd show tons of promise, do great a the start while I was learning the material, and then as soon as I knew how it all worked I could never focus on continuing to do it.  Contracts would never be terminated, because I was a good worker when I got my work done, they'd just be allowed to run out and not renewed.  

I don't know why I finally took the step to get a diagnosis.  Not sure what the final step was that pushed me to it. I know I had an epiphany when I found this subreddit and read through the list of symptoms of adult ADHD - I could identify with *so* many of them.  

But going to the doctor?  Sure I'd read over everything and I *knew* I had it, but all those times of being told I'm lazy, unmotivated, and just making up excuses echoed in my head.  My biggest worry was that I was just finding something else to blame my problems on -- just coming up with another excuse.  I didn't *really* have ADHD, otherwise I'd have been diagnosed as a kid, right?  

To be honest, now that I've been on some medication for a good while I still have that worry.  Luckily, my wife grounds me and lets me know that there's a definite difference between unmedicated and medicated me.

"2012","At the end of the day the only thing we can do is control our own actions and reactions. It may seem insensitive but I think those kind of statements are made out of ignorance. They either don't know you have ADHD or they don't know what life is like with it. Instead of letting it get you down and getting frustrated just acknowledge their ignorance and also that it's almost impossible for other people to know what ADHD feels like. If you can do that than these statements aren't such a big deal. 

I actually appreciate these kinds of comments, even though they can be annoying at times. If someone is telling me to just do something, that tells me that my add is holding me back from doing something I should be doing. They may have to tell me 10 more times but at least it gets the ball rolling. I feel like they're trying to help, or at the very least they want you to do what you're supposed to be doing. Try to make your voice the loudest one in your head. You know exactly what you're going through and you know what choices you have to make and what options you have regarding what you're going through.

Also I just want to add that, in my opinion, the world would be a much nicer place if people were less insensitive and less sensitive. So if people were less shitty to each other, and people were less butthurt over things people tell them, then the threshold for getting triggered becomes much narrower.","eytrt8f",1,1567444110,"2019-09-02 17:08:30"

Even the most hardcore drug addicts there addictions developed , im not addicted to anything now and im a very health oriented person but it doesnt take alot of cocaine before u start to crave it, do u like junk food, junk food is a drug, have you ever craved a pizza. Or sugar and had to have it, there is addiction in us all, 

addiction is the same for everybody the only difference with adhd is that once you are addicted it might be more difficult to stop, but there are plenty of people with addiction issues who dont have adhd, with adderall if you take enough for long enough like a recreational user , your brain could begin to form physical and pshycological dependencies, people become addicted to substances when they keep upping the anty for prolonged periods of time (years), eventually creating a drug dependant brain, 

I can tell you now that if you smoked ten cigarettes everyday for 4 years you would be severley addicted at this point

Its actually very easy to become addicted to certain things just as long as there taken long enough, look at how 98% (random statistic) of the world consumes coffee throughout the day, coffee which has caffiene in it which is a stimulant, and its 100 times weaker than adderall, but its because if how prolonged and persistant the drug is taken, 

Sometimes is based on how potent the delivery of the drug is that gets people hooked quickly because itw so different than you brains chemical homeostasis, like heroin apparently you can be hooked after taking it once

I got to walk around the mall area when I wanted, looking at random shit. I chose my hours. The hardest part was manually doing the drawer at night because I always messed up the math and couldn’t remember the order of things no matter how many times I did it.

"2059","I get a pen and paper out. If the tasks need to be I break them down into smaller mini tasks, if not I just list the tasks. I list them in order of priority. Be realistic as well, if something doesn't need to be done right away, the list should reflect that. For me I use a master list of tasks which have (iii) (ii) (I) and also :o if I needed to do it yesterday. I then make a list for each day of the week on Monday morning. 

Work thorough them, cross them out when you do it. This is satisfying as. After a couple you will look at your list and see what you have done and feel better about yourself.

Back to being realistic. My daily task list is in order of 'I need to do that 100%' to 'it would be nice'. I give myself the agency to get through the 'fuck I need to do that' and put the rest off if I want to do something different. If it helps give yourself a reward, like 'if I get through these five I need to do I will go do xyz (something fun)'. 

I find that when I am cruising through tasks seeing the list with all the crossed off ones inspires me to keep going and I tend to get more done. Acknowledging that I CAN stop at a point is empowering, I am in control. Some days (like yesterday where it was a public holiday and I came to work) I hit a roll and do two days worth (yay no clients). Other days (like last Friday) I get through everything by 3pm and accept I am struggling so leave early.

"2077","I've found its best to not buy things when I'm off my meds (or depressed but that's not ADHD related) just because I know I'm easily excitable and prone to buying crap.  Another strategy I find helps is to make myself a wishlist/wait-list and add things I want to it, then wait for a week (or a sale) and see if I still actually want what I added.  

The only free to play game I like is ""Team Fortress 2"", the gameplay has gotten really steadily more complicated over the years but its gone from a paid game to an honestly really-really free game since they added the option to buy cosmetic items then later equipment for the avatars instead of waiting for them to be awarded on a performance or random basis, which they still are.

Otherwise I tend to like Roguelikes and Strategy Games for their replayability when I know I'm too flighty to commit all of my attention to a serious RPG.  ""Crypt of the Necrodancer"" and ""Civ V"" are two favorites because of this.  CotN because I have to stop, block out everything and relax into a good zen to both keep time with the music and navigating the dungeon (also helps when I'm depressed because I have to block that out too in order to achieve maximum zen).  Civ V (or any Civ game really) because its turn based, so very forgiving when I'm distracted and not paying much attention.  I know ""The Binding of Isaac:  Rebirth"" is on 3DS now, it's a great Rougelike and might be worth a try if you're up for its unique sense of humor.  Pokemon is a good one (obvious one) that I've spent a lot of time passively playing while doing something else, last one I played was ""Pokemon:  Black"" on my DS; it was really great through university when I needed/scheduled a break from studying or was waiting for class to get started.

As for serious RPGs, I'm serious when I say I have to commit a block of my day to them otherwise I'll stop before the going gets good; also regret it later because I won't get my money's worth too.  Last time I did this I laid out 6:00pm to 8:00pm as time for ""The Witcher 3:  Wild Hunt"" and absolutely nothing else, no Netflix playing in the background, second monitor unplugged so to not be distracted by my current project, cellphone turned off... nothing because I was going to enjoy myself a little interactive Brothers Grimm stories that night or die trying.

I'm going to guess that you're not asking for advice telling you to stop gaming and I'm not either because that's how I like to unwind, but I will say that I don't game over the hours my meds are effective.  Even though those are some hours that I'm unbeatable, I enjoy that time more when I'm focusing on on one of my creative hobbies.  I have way too many, no thanks to the ADHD, but they're all creative in nature and so deeply satisfying to work towards completing.","dc8yf2r",2,1484069051,"2017-01-10 17:24:11"

"2091","What is it you're spending it on? Are they expensive hobbies or is it mostly food? What I do is figure out where all my money goes and I choose one hobby that I allow myself to splurge on (clothes are my weakness .\_.) and I allow myself to well, splurge. BUT not always. Maybe start easy like once a week or every other day. Going all or nothing sounds great but just feels like death that spending some money could spark life into. I have Bank of America and it can tell me where I spend money and set limits. 

Another thing is find hobbies that you already have or any backlogs of things. I guess I try to find something that will replace the happy chemicals that for some reason spending money releases so well. ADHD makes it SO damn hard for me to start something new or even get back into old video games for example. 

Sorry if this advice sucks, the truth is the best way to curb spending, and sounds horrible, is being poor. That has hands down made me learn how to budget. But I get that it's not always that.. easy? No that's not right GAH I hope you get what I mean. Lol. Being poor is the absolute worst but it did set my budgeting straight and helped me form better spending habits and discipline that I use nowadays.

Also having a friend who helps you stay on top of your budget can help too! Tell them you only want to spend $\_\_\_\_ and that they can try to help ease your desire to go over it.

The goal is to go easy on yourself but set realistic and maybe flexible goals. And to develop the discipline for how to learn that not everything needs to be purchased. Good luck friend!","ghdcohy",1,1609223705,"2020-12-29 06:35:05"

And magnesium supplementation can be helpful for all sorts of bodily processes.","ckmgrey",2,1411098052,"2014-09-19 03:40:52"

"2117","**TL;DR - Describe your impairments as they come up and bypass the need for a label altogether. Researching your condition helps to prevent and undo internalized stigma, and also aids in discovering new and helpful ways to cope.**

Great perspective and strategies here.

If I may add, I live in quite a conservative area, and while everyone is capable of bias, I've found it more prevalent in conservative societies. Personally, I try to omit the label *altogether*.

the diagnostic label can be a double edged sword. For me it has helped to sum up my impairments and help me understand myself better. Most other people's understanding only goes as far as ""Mental Illness"" or ""Mental Disability"" and a whole host of prejudices or misinformed biases are attached to that label. Once someone associates the label with you, it is very difficult to overcome.

What I've seen others recommend is describing the impairments themselves without ever using the label. Like 1) difficult working memory 2) stimulation sensitivity 3) Time blindness. These help explain very specific functional impairments and completely decouples any stigma that might be associated with the label, while also being able to convey your obstacles in a cooperative atmosphere. Also, bringing it up only when it is relevant helps too, instead of volunteering this information at the beginning of an interaction.

And like /u/litorisp mentioned, RESEARCH AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. If you live with these impairments and you don't understand what they mean, it is extremely easy to just believe someone when they tell you you're lazy because you can't come up with a better explanation. After getting diagnosed in my late 20s I assure you, I have carried around so much stigma and prejudice *against myself* because I simply didn't know any better and just believe the NT narrative of productivity and attention.

Seriously, use google scholar and just go wild with it. ""ADHD and stigma"" ""ADHD and hormones"" ""ADHD and executive functioning"" ""ADHD and drugs"" ""ADHD and learning"" ""ADHD and fitness"" the possibilities are endless. It not only empowers you to learn/try new coping mechanism, but also gives you the confidence when you encounter prejudice and bias in the wild. There are also inexhaustible videos and podcasts of testimony from patients that can help you relate some of your experiences, make sense of them, and learn from them. Whatever your preferred method for consuming information, there is so much to explore.","fzw65fd",5,1596219138,"2020-07-31 18:12:18"

It has all the information about myself written in it. 

My likes, dislikes, who I am, who I want to be, things I want in life, things I want to do in life, how to do those things, useful tips and tricks, how to be a better version of myself, names of people in my life that I need to remember, career goals, health goals, relationship goals, learning goals, things to try... you name it, its there. 

I also have a schedule at the front, every day I write down what I want to do for that day or the next. I usually write when I feel motivated, and act when my motivation is depleted because my instructions are there. 

I feel like motivated me is the smartest person in my life and someone I should listen to to live my best life. So I follow his instructions, and when I'm not sure about something I can look back at the Bible of Me and work towards something new or get clarification on what mindset I should have for a task!

By this the most sane thing to do for me in any project is to come up with minimal value product. The smallest possible list of things that I need to do. Write up separate stories for them (basically a description of what it does) and set them up in a form of list.

After that it's pop one add one. Whenever I finish something I write down next thing to the bottom of the list.

"2152","My experience so far is as follows -  
1. People have both tried to tell me that I have ADD, not ADHD. But also they've tried telling me I have ADHD but in a mild form. They've also told me that I'm not just being challenged enough. I've also taken the medicine that didn't work, visited the psychiatrists who've been used to try and warp my point of view to what my mother wanted, have been abused as a child, have failed school from grades 6 to 10, dropped out when I ran away.   Along the way, each one of my failures have always been internalized into a smouldering hatred for everything. I had very few friends, a family that in one instance watched me get kicked by my own parent and did nothing, bullied incessantly and just generally felt disliked.

   I ran away when I turned 18 under the guise of meeting a friend in another state and just never went back. This friend used the one gap in my armor and that was what little bit of self-esteem I had left. I was susceptible to feeling wanted and loved and they used it and I fell for it. The next 8 years was me just losing more of myself by an emotional manipulator, a mental abuser.    

2. I reached such a low point that finally nothing really mattered. I didn't care if I woke up again or not and just hoped I didn't because I wasn't gonna do the deed myself, But still I drudged on. At this point we we're almost homeless, we just simply had a roof over our heads, squatting in an abandoned home.  

Suddenly, one day, it all turned around. I was pointed into the direction of a job I was interested in. It was like finding the last piece of a puzzle that you lost ages ago and now the picture is complete. I succeeded at something for once in my life that wasn't video games. Something I could see myself doing as a career and that interested me. A few years later, after being promoted multiple times, I had some semblance of self worth. I left my then-wife and eventually left my then-job (because it was just a shit company with a job I was good at).  

3. I found a new job that was similar half a state away, better pay and somehow the work was worse, but I continued doing it because I convinced my then-GF now-Fiancee that we should move half a state away if we wanted to find better jobs, and she trusted me. She put her faith in me and let me lead and I couldn't let her down. 
  
  New apartments later, new experiences with being a responsible adult, I finally decided to leave that job and find a new path to something with a better future because I *felt* like I deserved a better future. Got hired at the county level as an IT Support Admin, soaked up what knowledge I could, got fired for one of my then-flaws (asking too many questions. I was very erratic when I was eager to learn) and took a heavy blow to my ego and my self-esteem again. But this time was different, I didn't get defeated by it. I got determined to get back on that horse, found a temporary job and worked on my skill set.  

 Now, I'm working salaried with one of the most Innovative and cultured workplaces in NY, getting my certifications, getting married, thinking about owning a home at some point.  
  
4.  If you remember, I mentioned a lot of *then-* items from my journey, and that was only a few I decided to include. Hitting the bottom eventually gave me insight into myself from somewhere outside myself. It's hard to explain, but I feel like I used to blame the world for my problems, but eventually I realized that I caused a majority of them, thinking the world owed me something for how shitty my life was growing up.  

 Truth is, world knows but world don't care. That deep-seeded hatred I had for everything was holding me back and I learned to transform it into a single point like a laser and cut through the bullshit. I don't know if I had ADD or ADHD or I was just bored or had a weird mentality from being abused or whatever.  

 What I do know is when I feel erratic or when I feel my attention is drifting to the ceiling in a conversation because there's a dead bee up there, or even when I feel like a friend or colleague just shit on me because I really fucked up and their true colors are showing and now I'm remembering why I have a hard time trusting people, I can step outside of myself, examine how I'm feeling and correct myself. Noone else is gonna do it for me, especially when they don't understand that there's a hurricane bubbling under that calm exterior, thinking, plotting, reflecting, swirling and churning with thought and emotion.

2. It's not too late to keep your job, and it's not too late to get diagnosed, adult diagnoses happen all the time (source: I am one). A priority right now should be to book an appointment with a psychologist/psychiatrist and have them analyze you.
3. If you do get diagnosed, and you do get medicated, be aware that the medication alone is not going to do anything for you if you are also suffering from another problem, such as depression which kicks out all kinds of motivation.
4. I want you to step back and realize, for your own sake, how long time really seems to be. You can spend months in a depressive episode, and it seems fucking terrible, but then years later you might look back on it and go ""wow, I was so upset, and I thought there was no hope for a better future, but now look at me"". I want you to realize this, because I want you to realize that you absolutely can overcome the problems you're presented with, even when it doesn't seem like it, just hold the line, and keep moving forward.

___

Absolutely get to a psychiatrist as soon as you are able, because that will get you any legal protections you may need, and will enable you to get treatment you may need, and, honestly, find out the real issue. Maybe, it's not ADHD, maybe it's bipolar disorder, or clinical depression, or maybe ADHD and clinical depression, no one here is qualified to say, only a trained doctor is, so get to them as soon as you can, because that's when you can really start to progress.

That's about as much as I can tell you based on my own personal experience with ADHD and work. In my case, I'll add, people have been extremely understanding when I've been upfront about my issues and the fact that I take medication for it. Slowly, very slowly, but surely, people are having better perceptions on mental health issues.

___

Lastly, I just want to add though, that it looks like you're getting into a dangerous downward spiral of negative thought where you end up blaming things on yourself. Medication is important, yes, but also important is behavioural therapy, and learning when to accept the right amount of responsibility and blame for what's happening in your life, because typically, you're taking on *too much* blame, and all it does it make you seem like you're worthless and don't deserve to be better off. Cut that out, because it's not true. You do deserve better, simply by wanting to be better. Again, I'm not trained to speak about this, but ask your therapist about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I'm currently treated for depression and ADHD, and I STILL do CBT, and it helps an awful lot with the things that medication doesn't (motivation and stopping useless negative thoughts).

Good luck, and never forget you're worth it.","dhpxpsp",3,1495114341,"2017-05-18 13:32:21"

"2167","So, I have a weird suggestion for this but I've heard that the best way to start a new habit is to pair it with an existing habit.

I make sure to leave my phone in another room and that way I am stuck alone with my journal for 5-10 minutes every day. The temporary boredom of not having anything to look at prompts me to do something with my hands -might as well update my bullet journal. As a bonus you have your lap conveniently serve as a writing surface! 

Anyway, that's my two cents. I've been consistent with my journal every since I started doing this. Then I usually want to continue it later in the day because I have things I want to cross off or add to it. What do you think of this idea?","ethfsnq",3,1562814289,"2019-07-11 03:04:49"

Once you are here just know that universities are super accommodating. You don’t need to tell every prof but you can register with the appropriate student assistance office so you are already on file for any assistance that you may want to request 
There will also likely be counselling for tips and advice, and/or support groups 

One little tip on language, it’s best to phrase it as I’m prescribed Ritalin or I take Ritalin
Using the term “do” with a medication here usually is understood as abusing the medication and usually refers to illicit drugs or improperly obtained drugs. I feel like a jerk for correcting you on this but I just wouldn’t want this to make someone think you’re abusing medication. So hope you don’t mind I said that.

"2249","The testing accommodations that I have are 1.5 time and distraction reduced environment (DRE). 

1.5 time helps because I have a tendency to get really anxious before exams, which caused a lot of minor mistakes before I had my accommodations. For example, if I'm really nervous about a calculus exam, I would make 4 or 5 simple addition or multiplication mistakes in the first 2 problems, just due to being nervous. Then I would get in the flow of things and the likelihood of me making more of those mistakes goes down over the remainder of the test. If I were allowed the normal amount of time, I wouldn't have enough time to correct these mistakes and my test score plummets, even though the exam has nothing to do with my knowledge of addition or multiplication. The 1.5 time allows me to go back through my exam and correct the careless mistakes that I am more likely to make due to ADHD and anxiety. 

Distraction reduced environment definitely makes the biggest difference for me. There are generally about 1/10^th the amount of kids in DRE compared to the main test location. Taking an exam in a huge lecture hall where there are small movements and noises in every direction is a nightmare. Before I started testing in DRE I would lose my train of thought every few seconds because my brain has a difficult time ignoring that constant stimulus.

Medication for ADHD is a godsend when it comes to certain things. It allows me to block out some distractions, listen to people when they are talking to me, and sometimes maintain a clear train of thought when solving problems. That said, it does not ""fix"" ADHD. I still completely forget what I was talking about mid sentence because the bus I was waiting for appeared behind the person I was talking to. I still find myself day dreaming after completing 90% of a problem, and then have to spend 3 minutes figuring out what I was about to write for the last 10%.

 Medication does not *cure* ADHD, it only helps manage it. ","d7n80j0",2,1473901466,"2016-09-15 01:04:26"

My timing while singing was pretty bad in the beginning but just keep working at it and it will get better. Also, like some others said, don't over do it. Work on chord shapes first and when you're confident in that, move on to transitioning between each (C to D, Em to G, G to D, etc.) until it's smooth. You don't even have to strum or press down too hard for this part. There's also different shapes for each chord if one of them is a little too difficult right now (like Barre Chords compared to Open or Power Chords). 

*Warning:* Your hand and fingertips will hurt. You'll probably get blisters. Both your strumming and fretting hand will feel really out of sync with what your brain wants them to do...but keep at it (with breaks, of course)! I promise it's all worth it!

About the sleep thing, I take my first dose at 7 AM, and then it usually runs out after 1 PM which is when my school ends. I never had problems sleeping because I take it so early in the morning.

Once I remember my studio in Korea was so filled with trash that it covered 80% of my entire floor,  I had a breakdown,  and finally forced myself to clean all of it and take 2 days off work.  It's basically always me holding up a giant facade that I'm functioning when it's half-true.

From being about 10 my mum knew that I had ADHD and she was my biggest advocate, but she also had a similar philosophy to your mum ‘you’re brilliant and talented in your head. But getting it out of there is the hard part’ and she’s right. You don’t have to be diagnosed to feel like you have ADHD. I knew for years before I got my diagnosis. I was told i was lazy and useless by so many teachers, and whether you’re diagnosed or not won’t change that, because teachers who call students useless are just shit people. In regards to medication I would say ask multiple doctors what they think would be best for you. I made the mistake of going straight in and I already feel like I’m addicted to my elvanse whilst i have other tablets instead now. Medication is so useful as long as you’re careful with it. I would recommend since your young giving some to your mum to keep at home, and then keep some at school with a member of staff or something. I would recommend you go for a diagnosis. If you have it then you can put your mind to rest and know for a fact that you do. And if it turns out you don’t then that’s equally okay. You won’t be less of a person just because you don’t have adhd. I’ve had friends who don’t have adhd but still struggle to focus, or sit still, because humans aren’t always great at that.

It made me incredibly irritable, impulsive, confused, and restless. All of these are listed possible adverse effects but I believe, in retrospect, it aggravated my ADHD symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity. From my understanding that could be because latuda blocks dopamine receptors, which isn't exactly what you want in ADHD. I did cease treatment with latuda about 3 weeks after starting it because I couldn't tolerate the effects, so it's hard to say if these would have gone away with time.

In it, the universe is created and recreated every second by a group of tiny people called the Timecrafters. They only create as much as is in any person’s line of vision, and sometimes one of them falls asleep or gets drunk on the job and misses something. Like my keys. 

If I can’t find something that I KNOW I just set down, I actually verbalize, “whoops, that’s a time crafters’ error” in order for them to put whatever it was back in the next build cycle. Sometimes it requires waking to the back of the house and back up front again.

Now, I know, cognitively, that this isn’t what’s actually happening - I don’t subscribe to many mystical belief sets - but it does let me pause, shake out my brain, and clear my head enough to come back in and put my eyes on the thing I was looking for.","f7h8zn8",1,1573735429,"2019-11-14 12:43:49"

However, if you can't focus at work or school then maybe taper it back as best you can.  start off with a video and game and slowly turn the volume down or let it stop after a video ends.  eventually you'll potentially find your only gaming or only surfing reddit.

For work prior to meds I'd get up every 30min or so and take a walk around the office and check in with folks occasionally.  Do what feels best, but try to not let it worry you if things are going well.  if you find like I did stuff piles up on the floor, days go by, and nothing got done on your *todo list* then taper what you can and refocus.  Refocus by stopping games and movies grab a drink, pen, paper and try briefly to write just three things on the high level list in your head that need to get done.

Personally meds have taken me from one end of the spectrum to the other, I haven't had alcohol in like a month and I don't really want to. I've also realised over the last while that I only really drink to be comfortable around people, so now I don't hang out with people much and I have no desire to drink.

Alcohol etc was my way of escaping the uncomfortable reality around me. Once I stopped being in an uncomfortable environment I stopped needing to drink. I have to move out of my wee apartment soon and probably into a share house and I'm afraid it will make me feel like drinking. 

Anyway, meds are the opposite. They make me more present and more capable. More consistent and normal. I'm not escaping I'm embracing the reality of situation and being ok with it. Less anxiety etc. But again, if you start doing dumb shit like taking more than a days dose or putting them up your nose then stop the prescription.

Ritalin and other stimulants will dehydrate you, so if you haven't you will need to increase your water intake to compensate. Drinking plenty of water will also help with the associated stomach issues, though that may not completely solve them.

Beginning of this year I told my psychiatrist I wanted to change medication, primarily because I felt it wasn't as helpful with my ADHD as I was hoping for and wanted to try alternatives, but also because it was rough on my stomach and was causing loss of appetite.

I've since moved to dexamphetamine sulfate, and aside from it seeming more effective and helpful with my ADHD, it's much less (to the point of actually not usually being noticeable) rough on my stomach. And while loss of appetite is still a side effect, it's much better than Ritalin was, such that I can make myself eat and do feel better for it duty immediately afterwards.

So yeah, I would suggest giving it a good go for a month or two at least, as part of the process is just getting used to the medication. If it's still causing you problematic side effects after that, then ask to change medication, because the side effects of something else could be much better, or it may help you more than Ritalin.","ejv1nt8",2,1554106586,"2019-04-01 08:16:26"

As for the rest of the post, here are my thoughts:

1) it can be very hard to get a proper diagnosis or treatment. No matter what your symptoms are, if you are struggling please call your Dr office and be frank about what's happening and how you feel. This might be ADHD, depression, anxiety, idk because there's a lot of symptom overlap. All of these things can be treated.

2) If your Dr was dismissive, it is totally a good idea to call the office and give feedback about the visit to the receptionist or anyone else. All drs should make their patients feel heard and understood.

3) you mentioned you have good grades but that you're struggling. I fell into this category, too. My advice here is to take a good look at where you're struggling and how you're coping. I got great grades because my mother was very controlling and punitive and basically didn't let me make mistakes. Are you managing to do things on your own or do you need excessive support from family and teachers? It can be really hard to tell how extreme the struggling is without more information","g2ungrb",1,1598395151,"2020-08-25 22:39:11"

"2369","Strattera is a second-line medication. That’s medical speak for “plan B.” 

Stimulants are by-far the best option for ADHD for the majority of people. In efficacy trials, the correct dosage of stimulant medication come about as close to a “cure” as medically possibly. Strattera is nowhere near as effective, and most people do have pretty nasty side effects. 

Strattera should only be considered if the patient hasn’t responded well to *multiple* kinds of stimulants, has serious heart problems that could cause death if they took stimulants, the patient has a recent or severe history of drug abuse, or the patient is just not willing to take stimulants. 

If you don’t fall into any of those categories, your doctor is prioritizing his feelings over your quality of life, and it’s time to get a new doctor.","esjawh9",1,1562029473,"2019-07-02 01:04:33"

People are downright astounded to learn I have ADHD. They don’t see me taking meds, going to therapy, setting a bazillion alarms, etc. In fact, I come off as more organized and polished than my neurotypical peers because I put more effort into actually being organized and polished than they do.

I got diagnosed as a kid (therapy is paid by the statutory health insurance here), but didn't take medication or receive therapy. My mother bought a couple books on how to deal with ADHD children and was more or less sucessfull in bringing me up. However my problems in school were at some point undeniable and the issues with and between my parents became bigger. I eventually got depressed in my teens, but managed to finish highschool with a slightly above average grade. My parents never understood my inattentiveness, forgetfullness and inability to study, even though those were absolute clear indicators of ADD and I could have been the casestudy of ADHD-PI for psychology class.

I wouldn't blame your mother, she is not a psychologist and ADHD is a really controverse diagnosis, not everyone believes in (my parents didn't believe in it, even though I got diagnosed and I didn't either, because being ADHD was on the same level as being mentally retarted for me, so I denied it). How are you so sure that you mother doesn't have ADHD? ADHD has strong genetic components it is pretty likely that at least one of your parents got ADHD aswell, but most likely learned to cope at this age.

Idk, I guess being on meds has made me more analytical(?) about how I use my time. So, by managing my time differently its made me more aware of where my time is going. I guess a bonus of being off meds is if I were forced to do something boring/repetitive, time just flys by. This kinda upsets me though...

You can also do some research on your own. There are a ton of advocate websites out there for ADD/ADHD. You might come across a psychologist that might be better for your needs-sometimes you need to find the right one yourself. Not only with the psychologist though, but coping methods overall. I know there are a ton of books out there and research. Remember, google is your best friend (if you would like me  to give you some links, I can!) Since you are in college, does your college give you empirical article sources/peer editorials/database access?  I know my school gives all students and professors access to databases-which is not only *great* for research for classroom assignments, but also great for individuals with conditions that want more information. I'm a psychology major and I always do random searches on the databases on topics I'm interested in for fun. I started doing it on ADD/ADHD too. I then took a class on disabilities in education (it's called Psychology of an Exceptional Child). I was able to use that information for papers too. :) It's interesting how much more you can learn looking at research some of the top specialists in the country conduct on the subject. 

No problem. I know the whole guess-and-check process is stressful. You'll figure out. Have someone help watch your health-since if you expect you are getting certain side effects from the medicine, it can be your mind *thinking* it is from the meds when it really is you stressing about the effects causing you to develop the effects. 

I know my insomnia progressed to something even worse than before when I took the booster because 1. adderal does not work with my body well and 2. it was too power for that late in the day.

"2443","I think it’s saying that by blocking the receptors the dopamine and serotonin remain for longer instead of being ‘re-uptaken’ (as in the way an SSRI works).  I’m not totally sure I understand this correctly though, so please seek professional advice on this. 

Read this bit:  

This means quetiapine is a dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic antagonist, and a potent antihistamine with some anticholinergic properties.[56] Quetiapine binds strongly to serotonin receptors; the drug acts as partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors.[57] Serial PET scans evaluating the D2 receptor occupancy of quetiapine have demonstrated that quetiapine very rapidly disassociates from the D2 receptor.[58] Theoretically, this allows for normal physiological surges of dopamine to elicit normal effects in areas such as the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways, thus minimizing the risk of side-effects such as pseudo-parkinsonism as well as elevations in prolactin.[59] Some of the antagonized receptors (serotonin, norepinephrine) are actually autoreceptors whose blockade tends to increase the release of neurotransmitters","fgqqvgn",2,1581029565,"2020-02-06 22:52:45"

- Learn about it.  Read Driven to Distraction or other books.  Know Thyself

- CBT works but generally only needed if you are struggling internally.  They could also assist you with developing coping skills.

- Take time and learn your weaknesses.  Where are you failing?  Brainstorm structure that you can build around that weakness to improve performance.

Youth is kind of relative. To a 23 year old a 15 year old is just a kid who has yet to see the real world.

To a 60 year old, someone under 40 is still a ""young pup"" who has not experienced the declining effects of aging past your prime. 

Sadly in our sociality typical stereotypes will mostly dictate how people perceive you. It's not your mental maturity that makes you an adult to observers, but rather it's your job, type of car you drive, attire, where you live, relationship status, lifestyle, speech, hobby, etc.

In a workplace (and in life also), the fastest way to shake the kid label and get acknowledged as an adult is to get married and have kids.","fauh6p3",1,1576347897,"2019-12-14 18:24:57"

It has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research. It is not listed in either of the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or ICD.

This means that Dodson, his explanation of these experiences, and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism. 

Although this sub's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven theories), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and this post has therefore **not** been removed.  We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and we find that many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions.

"2524","thanks!

What I mean by breakdowns was this: I'd spent my entire life up until about, like a year and a half ago or two years ago, learning to believe certain things. Some of these were not true, and some of them were important to my identity. I started to doubt everything because so many things I had believed were false, and that destabilized my identity - and at that point things that I might normally brush off really got to me.

I think it actually started a little before I suspected I had ADHD, when I started going out with my ex girlfriend and she would says stuff that implied I was much smarter and more attractive than her. I responded by telling her to not be so hard on herself, to which she was amused, but she put the idea in my head that maybe *I just couldn't see myself for who I was*.

Another time I was at my parents and she wanted to see pictures of my as a kid, but I was recalcitrant because I was a really unattractive kid and didn't want to show her - but eventually I dug them out... and I couldn't reconcile what I saw in the pictures to my memories. I looked fine, cute even, perfectly attractive and couldn't see why I would have ever thought I was ugly. 

These kinds of clashes between objective reality, how other people saw me, and how I saw myself kept building up over time and I really started to question my self perception.

Everything was open to attack - when I was failing in the lab, I started to question that I was a scientist. When my interest in my hobbies waned, even for a while, I began to question whether I even enjoyed them. I started getting negative intrusive thoughts that would attack the core of my identity as a scientist, and my basic worth as a human being.

Sometimes I would completely break down and spend a hour or more muttering to myself in shock, or crying, trying to reconcile reality with my perception of it. Usually when I was alone, but a couple of time it was something someone else said that set it off.

I was diagnosed partway through that process, which probably didn't help, since finding out you have a disorder that subtly influences your entire life which you didn't know about is certainly grounds for re-evaluating it.

Fortunately I had also started therapy, even before I was diagnosed, and that helped ""keep me on the rails"" more or less. Eventually I came through it, and I think that technique that personally helped me the most was CBT. It's a deconstructive technique that helps you break down and understand how you relate to the world so that you can change it. This was pretty ideal for someone who was going through a major upset in their confidence in not just myself, but who that self was. Did I even know? CBT let me answer that question, and thankfully in a way that was in line with my personality.

I realized a lot of things, and now I feel like a different person than I was before. I don't think I really changed, so much as I was able to realize who I was, when I hadn't know for years. I used to be in denial about a lot of things - now I'm not.

It was a painful process, during which I was pretty much useless as as a human being, but I came out of it stronger than I've ever been, mentally. I can face things that my former self just *couldn't*. I needed to accept who I was first to be comfortable with them.

Now of course, I wasn't wrong about *everything*. I am a scientist, among other things, but now I have a much better idea of *why* I'm a scientist. If someone wanted to argue with me about it, I could face them instead of run away.

Hopefully that gives you an idea of what I went through and if you might be going through something similar. If you are, the most important thing for me was to find something I could trust. For me, that was science. I couldn't trust myself, I couldn't trust other people, not even my girlfriend sometimes - but I could trust the scientific literature, so that's where I got my answers.

Anything you do has to be based on trust, and ADHD often means you can't trust yourself to do things. Accepting that was a struggle, but knowing it is a relief, because now I know not to trust myself to get things done, and I can warn other people about it.","cs2kfsr",1,1433989514,"2015-06-11 02:25:14"

A few things. I already have accommodations ( I took my 1st exam using them).

However, she is teaching a split course with another professor they switch at 8 week mark or the second exam which I just missed. I don't know if she'll be around and now I'm scared to even email her because of the way she 's avoiding responsibility of making the decision about whether the grade will count or not. She's assigned that responsibility to the DSS. Are professors even allowed to do this?

Generally a ""good fit"" is feeling comfortable with your therapist so your sessions are effective. They should help you come up with a plan for what you want to accomplish with therapy, and review your progress each time. It's ok to not know exactly what you want at first, they can also help you figure that out. Start with the reasons you sought out a therapist and work from there.

If you feel like you don't want to go to sessions because of the therapist, then that would be a sign it's not a good fit. It can be awkward talking to a stranger about your problems. If that doesn't get easier after a few sessions, or if you just feel like you'd be able to open up more with a different person, then you might want to look for a better fit too.","eym2ldp",1,1567197913,"2019-08-30 20:45:13"

I teach college, and I was diagnosed 15 years ago but am unmedicated (doctors really don't want to prescribe stimulants all of a sudden to a 40-something woman).  Just getting a diagnosis was a huge relief; it helped explain my entire life from kindergarten on.

I'm still learning the quirks and subtleties that this disorder can present.  I have also learned that not all that's ""wrong"" with me is down to ADHD, such as loud talking.  That's just who I am, in part due to family and also due to being a teacher (we yell, er, ""project"").

Your description is apt -- coming home after being in a strange country.  I do feel as if I'm among ""my people"" here in this forum.  Reading posts here can help us get a better picture of why we are as we are, as well as steps we can take to manage our lives better.

"2556","In the specific case of studying or just sitting down and trying to get some work done I've learned that I need a super specific environment in order to optimize my productivity and my ability to intake and retain information and concepts.

So for me I find what works best is:

1. Sit down at a large desk or table that has nothing on it other than what is essential to doing your work. This basically eliminates distraction and helps me to feel less ""claustrophobic"" when doing my work.

2. Wear comfortable clothes, and if you have long hair make sure you get it out of your face. One little thing that I've found with this was that I can sorta condition myself to focus better when I wear certain clothes. So as weird as it sounds, around exam season I tend to have a designated studying outfit that I wear (usually just sweatpants and a tshirt or something).

3. Have water nearby at all times and keep drinking throughout your time spent studying.

4. Have some small snacks nearby. Ideally something that you can have one little piece at a time like popcorn. That way you can mindlessly shove your had into the bag without having to take your mind or your eyes off your work.

5. Listen to some music that is good for focusing and will help calm you. These are really easy to find on youtube and there are different varieties so you just have to look around a little and find something that is somewhat mentally stimulating without being so stimulating that it becomes your focus. Essentially you just need some background noise. I'm a big fan of the interstellar soundtrack personally.

6. Talk to yourself out loud while you're studying. Talk yourself through your thinking and through difficult concepts. This helps me make sense of things and then retain that information. I actually find that sometimes when I get stuck on something, all I need to do is talk out loud and then I suddenly have that ""AHA moment"".

7. Take breaks. If you get stuck on something and you just start to get frustrated, you're likely not going to get anywhere. Just take a step back for like 10-15min and come back to it after doing something simple like going to the bathroom, refilling your water, just pace around a little bit and stretch your legs, etc. Don't take a break and watch youtube or something like that cause you'll likely end up in the youtube vortex of never-ending useless videos.

Some of these things were suggested by a therapist and other things I just found on my own based on trial and error. Hopefully some of these things will be useful for you. Good luck with the studying and with the class overall!

My go-to for replicating the sense of urgency is this:

Inhale, exhale, hold without air in your lungs, wait until you feel the urge to gasp for air, gasp, hold for several seconds, and release.

In a purely physical sense, you'll create a sense of urgency in that your body will inform you that you need air.

Now...as for replicating the sense of urgency towards purely work-related endeavors, that I'm not so sure about. More often than not it has to be tied to something outward (preset deadlines, sense of obligation towards another, so on). ","dqhw92l",3,1511940109,"2017-11-29 07:21:49"

"2568","I was recently diagnosed (28). I've been struggling with extreme emotions, blurting things out, and difficulties maintaining relationships since preschool. My dad (who's a teacher) could tell that something was different about me (he suspected ADHD) but my pediatrician said I was fine and I wasn't cooperative with the child psychologist. I think my elementary school suspected something as well, but my academic grades were great, maybe I'd grow out of my emotional difficulties (lol). In high school I started seeing a therapist. In college I saw a few and started suffering severe anxiety and depression due to friendships deteriorating due to my extreme emotions, and not getting into grad school because I couldn't study for the GRE to save my life. 

After college I moved back in with the folks and tried to get a job. After 4 years of having really bad experiences with coworkers at various jobs and getting extremely overwhelmed by chaotic work environments, I realized something was super wrong with me. I was the common thread in all the bad work situations. I thought I might have autism or something. So I asked a government agency to help me find a job that I'd be able to handle. Because I didn't have a diagnosis, they sent me to a psychologist. After 3 hours, I finally had an answer. But to be honest, I didn't believe her at first. It wasn't until I had the report in my hands and I saw my scores that I believed her. I was in the 99th percentile in the Barkley Scale of Executive Functions. I also luckily had a friend with ADHD that sent me one of Dr Barkley's lectures. All of a sudden everything made sense. It even explained things that the autism diagnosis I had given myself didn't explain. (In my degree, we talked a lot about autism, and not about ADHD, and sometimes they can present in similar ways). 

I've started meds (Strattera) and the world isn't so scary and overwhelming any more. Also, friends and family are pleasantly surprised that I can carry on linear conversations, can be in a difficult situations without rage quitting or having a temper tantrum, and that my emotions are less extreme. Though some friends are sad that I don't vibrate with excitement anymore lol.

The problem is that most people are naturally good at regulating their emotions. They hype themselves up when doing or about to do fun stuff, they visualize the outcome of their work while busy, etc. This produces a strong emotion to ""counter"" the underlying mood.

We're... pretty terrible at that, so the mood kind of takes over. We also tend to hyperfocus on stuff, including trying to make it go away, which tends to make it worse.

Meds usually help the most. So do meditating and training yourself to regulate your emotions, but those take a loooong while to have noticeable effects.","etlw4yh",2,1562946646,"2019-07-12 15:50:46"

"2579","We all want to do well, but we also all want others to *think* we're doing well. That's why it seems like everyone else is doing better: they're trying to make it look like that. They're managing their image. It's like Facebook, when your friends are only posting the good things that happen to them, and it looks like you're the only one anything bad happens to.

Unless you're a celebrity, you are your own harshest critic.

&gt; Medical school, for me, has been a never-ending cycle of wanting so badly to be better, trying, failing, and barely making it to the next course.

Why did you keep trying each time you failed or nearly failed? What made you think it would be any different the next time? Here's my theory: because you believe you have the potential to succeed. That's the paradox of ADHD, the blessing and the curse: it's not that you try, fail, and assume you're just not capable. You try, fail, and believe that you failed despite being capable. This is the dangerous part - if you didn't fail due to lack of skill or knowledge or innate intelligence, you and others assume it must be a character flaw. This is why people with ADHD are often labelled ""lazy"" instead of ""stupid."" People look at a person with dyslexia, and it looks like they're trying hard but still failing, so they assume that person is stupid. People look at a person with ADHD, and it looks like they're doing fine for a bit, but then they just get distracted and stop trying - if only they had a bit of self-discipline, they'd do fine. So they assume that person is lazy and weak-willed.

Hidden in all these negative perceptions is an important but easy to miss fact: if it's not clear that someone has the potential to succeed at something, then people don't blame them for failing or wanting to give up. It's **clear** that **you** have incredible potential. You're in med school at 24 despite having ADHD and depression. You've accomplished a lot, and you **know** you can succeed. **That's why you're hard on yourself.**

&gt; I have to believe it will get better. I don't believe it right now but I have to eventually.

There's a huge difference between not believing you can, and not believing you will. If you don't believe you *can* do something, then it's very easy to say, ""why bother trying?"" It's logical, if a bit defeatist. It's how many people live their lives, content because they don't think they could do better. If you don't believe you *will* do something, that just means you could do it, but when you try to picture yourself doing it, you see it just not happening, for some reason or another, and you judge your hypothetical self. This is a symptom of depression. All you can think of are the times you failed in the past, not the times you succeeded - in getting through high school, in getting through college, in getting into med school, in meeting your SO *and maintaining a relationship with them* (That's hard for people with ADHD).

Because you know that you didn't fail because you just aren't smart enough or clever enough, that means there was just something wrong with your approach. Try looking at one of your recent mis-steps from a detached, analytical point of view. Instead of treating it like evidence of some weakness of character, treat it like a symptom, because that's what it is. Put on your medical professional hat and scientifically examine what went wrong, as if it's someone else's experience.

Imagine a person recently diagnosed with diabetes. Maybe a kid with type 1, or an adult with type 2. They try to keep in mind their disease, but sometimes they get caught up in the moment, maybe at a restaurant with their friends, or too absorbed in their work or school, and they crash or spike. It's not that they're stupid, and it's not that they lacked the willpower to constantly mind their levels. It just happens sometimes, because people tend to assume they're normal, and it's easy to forget when everyone else can do something ""the normal way"" that you can't. The wrong approach is to tell that diabetic person that they can never participate in ""normal person"" things, that they must always eat at home from carefully prepared special boring meals and must choose a job, a life that makes it easy to manage their diabetes. No. You work with that person to help them come up with strategies that let them live life by dealing with their illness as just another part of life. It's just a slightly different way of doing things. Maybe they carry a little finger-pricker thing and some emergency glucose in their purse or manly man bag when they're out with friends, and they set up subtle reminders on their phone to check themselves every so often at work or at school. With the right support system, they can get used to it and live life with relatively little overhead.

Like that diabetic person, you can't pretend you can approach life exactly the same way someone without ADHD can. Someone else can say, ""Oh, I'll remember that,"" and have a chance of actually remembering. Us, not so much. But that doesn't mean you're doomed to a life of forgetting important things and your license expiring or your rent being late. It means every time you get a bill, you ALWAYS put 5 different reminders in your phone to beep at you **before** it's due. It means when you get some important paperwork, you leave it paperclipped to your keys, or taped to your bathroom mirror, somewhere you CANNOT miss it. It means when a patient mentions a symptom, you write it down, and when your boss verbally asks you to do something, you ask them to please send you an email and then you write that shit down in two different places right then and there because you carry at least 3 moleskines or folded-up pieces of loose leaf or just ANY paper you can write on, and at least 5 pens with ink on your person AT ALL TIMES, and then you put a reminder in your phone or your Outlook or both to remind yourself to do that thing. It means that you take the [Checklist Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/The-Checklist-Manifesto-Things-Right/dp/0312430000) to the n^th degree. It also means you plan every day, and schedule time to plan every day, and set multiple reminders that hey, it's planning time for the next 15 minutes and hey, that's enough planning for today, you're getting bogged down in details.

There are so many of these little coping mechanisms mentioned in various books and various threads in this subreddit that it seems overwhelming. But once you have one in place, it melts into the background, and it's just there helping you, and if it doesn't work, you're not a failure, it's just not for you, and you try another, because it's worth it to have a life that's not consumed by your ADHD. You can be in crisis mode, or you can be in management mode, and once you can get into management mode, it just gets easier and easier. You don't remove the structure you created for yourself any more than a diabetic person would stop checking themselves and assume they know what low or high feels like; you just optimize your systems for your life.","cnhwtr9",2,1420680862,"2015-01-08 01:34:22"

Is it possible she's ADHD as well?

(I also did the majority of the housework, despite being the youngest in a family of five.) Are you a woman? There's a lot of data on how ADHD presents and is experienced differently for girls and women, which traditional gender roles play into heavily. I doubt your mom is doing it deliberately, but boys often get off the hook for housework because: boys. It would be very reasonable to put your foot down gently next time it comes up, like ""I'd love to see you, but I'm a bit overextended already with coursework and my jobs and caring for my own space to help you clean up.

"2604","There's a lot to it. It's definitely not a 'set and forget' therapy or anything. You have to stay in communication with the school and teachers, and find or become an advocate for what your child should be getting from the education system. The official diagnosis didn't happen until 2nd grade. Then we had to set up meetings with the school teams, principal, counselor, teachers etc. From that we determined that she needed a ""504"" plan in our state. She wasn't eligible for an IEP because her grades weren't low enough, but the 504 is customizable and allows for accommodations to keep her towards the front of the classroom, have extra time on tests if needed (something we've been trying to break is that she rushes through tests way, way too fast and doesn't go back to look for mistakes...), have checkins on homework progress and note taking, etc. These things build as the grades go higher and the work gets harder, but by staying in touch we've found strategies that work for her and us, and the teachers.

Initially my wife was very concerned about using medication, not wanting her to become addicted or reliant on them. Once she learned more about ADHD and how the meds work, she became more comfortable with them and since then it's been another blessing - better impulse control, more focus, lots of improvements. It also took going through 3-4 different meds and a range of doses before we found the one that really worked for her - that process took a few years, because you really need to give each dose change at least a few weeks to see how it's working out in the long run.

She is currently in 7th grade and came home yesterday beaming with pride about an A on her math test - her first A in a long time, but it's the result of years of effort! I struggle with ADHD every day and it makes me sad to know that she will too, but I'm also very glad that we are starting to build good habits out of what was initially a nearly volatile situation. We had many nights of screaming about homework, refusing to do things, etc. So patience is needed, but it will work eventually.","dgru2x4",1,1493212650,"2017-04-26 13:17:30"

"2613","First of all, ""low self-control"" is not a diagnostic criteria for ADHD, and people with ADHD don't necessarily have ""low self-control."" 

Part of the reason I resisted my diagnosis and getting help for so long is because I thought that ADHD = lazy. Besides the fact that I didn't want to be labeled as lazy, I also didn't identify with the stereotype. No reasonable person would call me lazy, if anything I am a neurotic workaholic.

It's sort of like asking, ""how do you differentiate between someone who has schizophrenia, and someone who is just bat-shit crazy?"" Mental disorders are not personalities. 

I can't speak for other people, but I'll tell you why I know I have ADHD and not ""low self-control.""

Over years of coping with undiagnosed (at the time) ADHD, I've learned how to manage my disorder pretty well. I'm finishing my bachelor's in mathematics in just a month and my grades are excellent in mathematics/engineering/computer science/physics, and I'm about to start grad school. Throughout my degree I have worked full-time, and I managed to snag one of the highest paying internships in the country, among many other things that I do.

So what about me is ADHD? Let me give you a list:

- The only reason I've survived school is because I've developed an extreme system. 

- I downloaded an application that shuts me out of most of the internet completely for days at a time (except the parts I need to use for work/school). Like a self-imposed child block.

- I've deleted all of the browsers and non-essential applications from my phone.

- I've bought a time-sealed safe, so that I can put anything in it which is a distraction from work. It stays locked for up to 10 days.

- I have to work in a non-distracting environment, which means I spend more time at the library than I do at home because it's the only place I can go where there is quiet and a lack of movement.

- Even still, it often takes me 10 to 12 hours to do a 2 to 4 hour assignment.

- If you don't know how difficult it is to focus or think when there are lights and sirens in your head 24/7, I can't explain it. 

- Many people think that those with ADHD only have trouble focusing on things they don't want to do, or on unpleasant tasks, as if they are conveniently selective in what they focus on. This is not true. Unmedicated, I can't sit through a movie or television show, even one I enjoy. This is true for all people with ADHD, the only reason why ADHD is associated with a lack of focus on work is because where ADHD interferes with work and school is where it causes the most problems. The only caveat to this is that ADHD is also associated with hyper-focus, or the inability to stop focusing on something. This is because ADHD is not actually a deficit in focus, but an inability to regulate focus.

- Even when I have shut out every single distraction, and there are absolutely no diversions within walking distance of me, I still cannot focus. I'm constantly hyper-alert and my thoughts race. Every few minutes, I have to force my attention back on what I'm supposed to be doing, and I don't have any problem getting back to work, but a minute later I am distracted again. Even if I catch myself becoming distracted every time and switch back to the task instantly, a significant amount of my time has been eaten up by having to constantly start and stop the task.

- Like many with ADHD, I can become extremely absorbed and obsessively hyper-focused on certain things. For me, this is mathematics. I can't sleep if I can't solve a problem. 

- I appear constantly nervous and fidgety

- I am chronically bored and restless

- I often leave the house and while driving forget where I was going

- I often leave the house, then get lost in thought, and while on auto-pilot drive right back home and don't realize until I'm at the front door that I just drove in a circle and I didn't actually go where I was supposed to

- I ""drop the ball"" constantly and am notorious for it. For example, I've received close to a thousand dollars in parking tickets, which I often forget to pay. 

- One time I missed three flights in one day. I was supposed to receive a medal at Carnegie Hall, and I just plain forgot. It wasn't until I was on my second cup of coffee while chatting with my mother that I realized I was supposed to be in New York that day. I paid the fee to reschedule, then missed the second flight, then a 3rd.

- When I arrived at my family's reunion last month on time, my father joked that ""I made my flight for the first time in my life"" and that I had ""a high streak of one, congratulations."" I didn't tell him that I did in fact miss my flight, yet again. I was sitting right at the gate, but I got so absorbed in a problem I missed them calling my name three times, right next to me.

- I am infamous for all of these things

- Several people in my family have ADHD.

- I have on a few occasions done things like switching the return address and recipient address on a letter, and not realized it until I received the letter from myself in my mailbox

- As early as Kindergarten I would do things like write my name instead of the answer to the problem on the answer line, or write the date on the name line

- I often leave my car running by forgetting to take out the key. I've accidentally left my car running for an entire workday more than once.

- I have driven off with the gas nozzle still in

- I have worn my clothing inside out all day without realizing on multiple occasions

- My life is incredibly embarrassing. I have a lot of co-morbid anxiety.

- I probably hold the world record for being tardy

- Because I have been evaluated several time by a doctor, psychiatrist, and my therapist who has known me for years, all of which agree with my diagnosis.

- Because I dismissed my therapist's diagnosis, despite her urging me to get treatment many times over the years before I finally realized that I need help.

- Because I know that I have a problem, and that problem is not a lack of self-control, it is a neurological deficit in my brain's ability to regulate focus.

"2648","I would be absolutely lost without my phone. It's one of the only things that helps me be a capable adult. I have an app for just about everything I need. 

Productivity challenge timer. This is a pomodoro type app. I use it when I'm struggling to get focused. I like the slightly snarky undertones to everything. 

Stock calendar app. I use this for everything that needs to happen on a specific day. This helps me keep up with my school deadlines, keeping me from flaking in my social life, helping me completely forget my doctors appointments. I have a widget on my homepage that shows me the list of everything coming up and a widget that shows a calendar on the next page that allows me to easily add things on specific days. 

Habitica. I recently started using this and I think it's really cool. It's a to do list, habit forming type app. You get a character and you can use that character to fight monsters and collect items. The more you cross off, the faster you level up. It's kind of like a game. If anyone wants to join, I'm looking for members for my party. If you message me, I can send you an invite to the site through your email or you can send me your username after you sign up and I'll invite you that way. It's pretty fun. It's helped keep me productive and actually start habits. 

Plant nanny. I recently downloaded this and it's done exactly what I needed. It's a cute little app. You water a plant every time you water yourself. It allows you to input your weight and activity level and it gives you an amount of water you need to drink. You can also set it to remind you to drink at certain intervals but it also doesn't remind you during the night, I believe it's from 12-8. 

Buy me a pie. I use this one to help me keep track of my shopping list. I'm sure everyone here knows what an ordeal it can be keeping track of a paper list and pencil or just trying to remember everything off the top of your head. I like this one because my SO and I can access the same one. It's harder for us to buy duplicates because we both know what's needed and what's not. 

OvuView. This one is for all you ladies out there. This is the app I use to track my period. It's helpful because I can answer the doctors question when asked instead of guessing by quickly looking it up and it helps predict when my next period will start so I can remember to restock all my tampon stashes. On the paid version, there's even a widget that discretely let's you know the days until your next period. ","d2cqcgl",2,1461302435,"2016-04-22 05:20:35"

It is just easier to say methylphenidate when referring to the active ingredient, because it most drugs, the particular salt form used is irrelevant. 

Now for dexmethylphenidate vs methylphenidate: They are the same molecule, *kinda.* It can be hard to understand but let me try and explain it with an analogy: A machine at a company must be man-operated to work and requires to 2 hands to function. The machine is set-up for right handed individuals. If you have only one person do this job, they will be effective with their **right** hand, but not as productive with their **left** hand. This is methylphenidate. To improve the effectiveness of the machine, the company hires a second person.

"2698","Also, a little suggestion from someone who's ""been there"" and is finally making some progress: build your career around things that help you focus.

I am really, really good at fixing stuff when it breaks. It's a new interesting problem, it's urgent, and it doesn't last long enough to require long-term planning, just until it's fixed, then on to the next broken thing. That makes the support/sysadmin side quite interesting to me.

I am also good at figuring out things I don't know how to do. It's novel, it's a challenge, and there's limited planning involved because how can you plan for something when you're doing it for the first time. I keep notes on what I do as I figure something out, and then other people can re-use those later once I've figured something out for the first time. Meanwhile, I'm on to figuring out the next thing.

I can motivate myself for longer-term projects when the project itself interests me and when it includes a ""figuring out how to"" component. This is why I am now able to transition into science as a PhD student - I picked my research topics so they're interesting to me, and they involve a lot of figuring out how to do things to make the research work.

That motivation keeps me in the project work once I get it started, but doesn't help me get started. For that, I have to use some tricks - no email/phone/etc. until I've worked for at least 10 minutes to get past the ""getting started"" barrier (and once I'm working, I no longer want to check my email anyway). And to get past the ""getting started"" barrier, breaking things down into very small tasks scribbled onto a piece of paper so I can cross them off as I go - ""open laptop"", ""open code from last week"", ""open PDF with the equations I need in it""... once I've gotten those scribbled on a paper and made it through the first 5-6 items, I get back into flow and can work for hours.

It sounds like you’re really supportive which is awesome. My advice is to accept that your partner isn’t going to get rid of the behaviours completely even with treatment, so finding a tactful way to bring up issues without putting them down is a must to preserve their self esteem. Nothing makes someone with adhd feel more unloved than being criticised but that doesn’t mean issues should be unaddressed...you might just need to find a unique way to approach them that works for you and your partners adhd.

In saying that, don’t accept any kind of lashing out or verbal abuse directed at you, it’s important to keep your sanity too.

I know for me when the frustration hits (trust me it doesn’t take much) I don’t want everyone to rush in and take over or try and help.

When people start pushing me to ‘persevere’ with a task that I’m getting frustrated and irritated with is when I’m likely to really really lash out.

"2762","You have some solid questions. I can relate pretty well and would characterize myself as being chronically fatigued. I find most of the time it isn't that I don't wake up feeling unrested no matter what, but that one of two things has occurred:  


1. I have a non-negotiable commitment like work in the morning and force myself up at 8 but I stayed up exceedingly late fucking around with god knows what and told myself ill stop in 5 more minutes repeatedly for hours, was doing the thing I didn't do at 2pm.. and 3... and 4 and so on, or was frustrated that I got mildly distracted and will only get 7.5 hours of sleep so I intentionally avoid that frustration through activity and now my night is cut to 4 hours. 

OR  


2. I don't have a commitment in the morning (or maybe just a soft one that could be done at 2pm. or 3. or 4.) And so I stay up just as late because there is no pressure to be up early but then I will wake up at 2 pm immediately feeling like an anxious and fatigued wreck because I'm an adult who now must fit my entire day into 3 hours in the afternoon, I can't find my socks, I have 6 unanswered texts from people before noon and if I respond now they'll know I just woke up and feel like actual garbage so lets put that off till later and say my phone died, worry about forgetting in a follow-up conversation that I told them my phone died and getting called out on it, realize I probably got a parking ticket for a permit area on my block since I slept in, finally mustering up the energy to go shower, taking an hour, and FINALLY realizing I only have 1.5 hours to fit my entire day into when all I want to do is just read a fucking book and am now emotionally and mentally drained as hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I woke up at 8 after going to bed at midnight and I was shocked at how refreshed and well rested I felt. Actually stunned over how great it was.

Today is a number 1. Had a job interview scheduled for 9 this morning. accidentally stayed up till 2 and out of anger and frustration that I'd only get 6 hours of sleep with anticipation of feeling fatigued this morning and potentially bombing the interview as a result, proceeded to watch a movie, play VR poker, and play guitar to avoid said feelings. Went to sleep at 7. Woke up at 8:15. Felt like a dead man. Nailed the fucking interview out of the park by the grace of God. Now I've been on reddit for 3 hours. I've got shit to do. Looks like it may turn out to be a number 2 day after all.  


TL;DR  
I'm not fatigued when I go to bed on time, its that:   
1. I'm chronically underslept with a full day ahead of me because I stayed up

 2. I'm Emotionally gassed because I have 3 hours to do 8 hours of things because I slept in after staying up late.","gpofbpe",2,1614881029,"2021-03-04 18:03:49"

"2769","Ah, I think I see what you mean now, and I have to admit I misunderstood what you meant by ""impulsive actions"". I think I would chalk this up to ADHD presenting differently in different people. I think of myself as an ""impulsive person"", but I don't feel like I'm compelled to *do* things or to do *specific* things. My mind just goes, all the time, and I've learned to practice the conscious self-restraint that so many ADHDers are familiar with. That fight against myself only ever subsides when I'm either relaxing with friends in a setting where it's okay to say ""inappropriate"" or ""random"" things, or in those crisis situations I talked about.

"2773","I was a great student in elementary to middle school. When I went in for my assessment they kept bringing up how good my grades where in certain subjects. I actually got really anxious over this, because while I generally get decent (B- to A) grades, the ways I get there are fucked up. It's always full of not being able to focus, being distracted, procrastination, and stress. I was terrified they would ignore my family history of it and other severe symptoms because I got good grades.

After years of just barely getting by in school I graduated and everything basically fell apart. Without that tiny, tiny thread I was hanging onto everything got ten times worse. I realize in hindsight that even though I was getting good grades, I wasn't functioning well. Even when my ADHD wasn't as visible it was still there, just passed over by the adults in my life.

TL;DR Yes, I seem to have gone through the same thing as you. All my report cards say ""very smart but needs to focus on instructions more and stop talking impulsively."" Even now, I skim over tests and make silly mistakes because of it.","clnmhhe",1,1414621675,"2014-10-29 22:27:55"

"2782","You're welcome!

I echo the other replies here regarding rationalizing your symptoms.  After many adult years of wondering why my mind was all over the place and dealing with the other struggles that relate to ADD, I finally bit the bullet and was professionally diagnosed a couple of years ago with textbook tick-every-box inattentive ADHD.  Yet to this day I still catch myself feeling like a fraud on occasion.  It's ridiculous, I know it's ridiculous, but that's actually a part of how an ADD brain often works.  I'll spend hours going down mental rabbit holes thinking about all of the various scenarios of how a particular thing might go wrong (as well as how it might go right, btw - it's not all bad).  That includes considering all the possible ways that **I** might be wrong about my ADD no matter how unlikely that is.  

On that point: One thing that I've learned is to embrace this ""ability"" that I have to naturally play out scenarios in my mind.  With the control and better mental clarity that the meds give me, I can kind-of direct these thought processes onto my work and come up with all sorts of possible scenarios and opportunities in a relatively short space of time that nobody else thinks about.  

Anyway, of course I have digressed a little, but I hope you see my point.

Final bit of advice: See a psychiatrist, not a psychologist.  ADHD*, at its core*, is not behavioral - it is physiological. Behavioral therapy might help fix some of the effects that ADHD has on a person, but only once you've gotten those neurotransmitters functioning more closely to normal. Watch all of Russell Barkley's talks on YouTube, particularly [What ADHD really is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_RIKaXq9ro).","e23gu8r",3,1531183317,"2018-07-10 00:41:57"

"2805","Going on a morning walk could help. Walking, going to school, and interacting with friends is important. A lot of people have been doing online school, and some are having trouble.

Look at it this way:

*You have a satisfaction meter.* HW isn't going to fill this meter, and you are restless until you fill this meter.

*Example:* 

**Unsatisfied:**

You wake up, try to do hw, go on reddit, watch some cool videos, lay in bed, browse social media. You try to do HW, but it is just boring. You want something cool.

**Satisfied:** 

You wake up, go on a morning walk, see some cool squirrel on the sidewalk, make breakfast, eat. You try to do HW, and you find it's a bit easier to do. You have already done some stuff for the day, and you have an easier time starting HW.

It's like if you were a kindergartener in school. If the kindergarteners were just told to do their work, and listen in class, they would become so bored.

But if they go out to lunch, eat their pbj, and play with their friends; then when they come in to the classroom, they're like: ""Ok, I guess I can do this multiplication, it's not too hard"". 

I would have trouble just doing hw, but going to school and doing those things are nice, and the work is something that I'm like: ""Okay now I just have to do this thing"".

So maybe try doing something everyday that is similar. Go on a walk, cook a new meal, talk with a friend. Then do your homework and things like that.","gqvqb5q",1,1615708310,"2021-03-14 07:51:50"

I feel like trying to be well organized and responsible is more stressful for me than just not doing stuff I don't want to do and living with the consequences. 

This is ofc anecdotal, but I eventually became a manager and what I really had to learn is not to have things that depend on me doing something, because as you said, you just randomly stop being able to do things.

"2812","Set multiple alarms before bed. And train yourself to respond to those alarms. It is hard, but you can eventually pavlov yourself to respond to alarms and do things on schedule, like getting yourself to shower or exercise or eat breakfast after each alarm instead of being on your phone.

Each alarm you set is a schedule to do something.

And somewhere in there, schedule an alarm to be on your phone. Give yourself a window of time to be on your phone, and give yourself a window of time to do other things.

For example, 7:00-7:15 you shower and change, 7:15-7:30 read a book, 7:30-7:45 is phone time. 7:45 drive to work.

Set alarms, name them, try out different times.

It will get you where you want to be if you stick with it.

When you schedule how long you have to do something you don’t usually do, you might do it more. When you have an open schedule it’s hard to focus on doing something if you have no expectation of when to stop.

So schedule it. Use alarms or countdown timers.

Time yourself to read a book for 5-10 minutes before or after going to sleep. You don’t have to keep worrying about how long you have been reading or when you can be on your phone again or whatever. Your timer will do that for you.

Just like at work. You have a time set already for how long you work until break time or lunch time. Do that for home too. You’ll eventually learn to control your ADHD instead of letting it control you.

And it starts with using alarms and timers. You have the mental capacity to do anything you want to do. Just use the timers to help you manage your time to do those things. 

The timers and alarms will help you form habits. Good habits. You can do this.","fpumi3g",1,1588916930,"2020-05-08 05:48:50"

The hard part of dealing with ADHD is how we perceive things as signal vs noise. When you do something like this so many times in a semester, it perceptually becomes noise (at least to me it would). The trick might be to figure out if there's anything interesting in a particular topic that is appealing to you to give each lesson some significance besides just being an exercise.

To stop obsession takes more work, and in my case I usually have to find something else to be obsessed about. The only that at least helps is distracting yourself with other stuff.

Hope you figure it out :D

1. Get as many people to help you pack and carry boxes as possible. I can't stress this enough.
2. If you haven't used it in so long that you forgot about it, it's probanly trash.
3. If you're not sure whether or not you need to keep something, it's probably trash.
4. It's okay to throw some things haphazardly into boxes without sorting them. Not everything, because otherwise it'll take much longer to unpack. But don't agonize over getting everything perfect.

As far as actually getting started when feeling overwhelmed, don't think, ""I have to pack this whole apartment."" Think things like, ""I'm just going to empty this one shelf, fill this one box,"" etc. I find that it's much easier to convince myself to do a number of 2-minute jobs than one big 48-hour job.

Also make sure you play some music or something in the background while you work. You could even think of it as, ""I feel like listening to music, and I'm just going to keep my hands busy with this while I listen to that."" So the music is your main activity, not the packing.

I would just space out while practicing, and not realize that I wasn't accomplishing my goals. I couldn't build on each day, because my practicing was so scattered. By the time I figured out, it was too late for my piano major to survive. Based on what I thought back then, and what I've learned about gaming, here are my suggestions:

In games, you have constant small goals, and it's designed to give you a sense of accomplishment. So structure your piano practice like that.

1. Break up everything into 4 or 8 measure sections. Stuff like Bach may require 2 measure sections!

2. Set Very Small Goals. Fingering, each hand alone, hands together, speed, memory- these are all separate goals for each section.

3. Give yourself a mini-celebration when you accomplish each goal. Play the victory music from Zelda or even sing like the heavens have opened. Raise your hands to the sky; do a little dance. Just something silly and fun to give you that dopamine rush.


4. Make it a habit to write down exactly what you worked on every day, so you don't go too long without reinforcing a section. 

I almost feel inspired to practice myself now!

"2843","I don't think this is so much attributable to ADHD as it is to insecurity in general. People who are otherwise mentally normal can feel this way too. In my personal experience, insecurity has always felt wholly separate from my ADHD. It takes a completely different kind of treatment to deal with it. I've had to learn to believe in myself, and realize that other people mess up as much as I do most of the time. I've had to focus on the traits I have that make me a valuable human being, and remember to think about them every day. 

I've gotten to a point where my self esteem is mostly healthy, and I don't just let people use me as a doormat anymore. But I've also known loads of people who experience the same problems without having ADHD. 

Insecurity is just another mental quirk we have to deal with as humans, and it is definitely something we can deal with. It just takes time, effort, and the ability to foster self love.","easpjzu",1,1543597311,"2018-11-30 17:01:51"

You and I both know there's still a lot of stigma around mental health these days and I can imagine after a lifetime of someone being told they're lazy, stupid, and clumsy, that they want to change the narrative that describes them.

Like you I agree it's not a gift, but let's ignore the people who are talking out of their ass for a minute. They have no idea what they're talking about anyway. Most days it is a burden for us. We live in a world that is not designed for our convenience and has no patience for our differences. People don't understand because they don't face the same challenges; we climb perilous mountains day after day but if we try to talk about it we risk getting smothered with stories of pleasant strolls through hilly parks and meadows. They just don't get it.

------------------------------------------------

It's damn frustrating and I understand what it's like when the world seems to be crashing down around you every goddamn day. How are we going to get through to next month, or even see the end of next week when everything seems to be in a state of emergency right now? 

But I know you will get through, all of us here do. Day after day and one step at a time we push through. The fact that you had the wherewithal to come here shows me you are capable and willing to get through this. You knew that coming here was the right choice for venting about your ADHD and if you've got that down you'll tackle your other problems too.

------------------------------------------------

If your problems seem overwhelming try to break them down into smaller pieces and take on those pieces on at a time. If your whole house is messy don't see it as having to clean the whole house, see it as cleaning a room. Start with your favorite room to clean (mine is the bathroom because it's the smallest), and make a list of what you have to do to get that room clean. Then do the same thing with the next room. Eventually you'll have a whole house clean and all you did was clean some rooms. 

Don't be afraid to spread these multi-part problems out over a couple of days either, it'll help avoid burnout. Like you I can be really messy at times and if I throw myself at cleaning for a whole day I may get a spotless house by the end of it but I also want to avoid cleaning until it becomes a problem again. 

If you're a white stripes fan [Little Acorns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOS00ttAblQ) is about this very thing. Give it a listen if you have a minute.

"2881","You should definitely give yourself some grace because it is going to be hard, like damn ADHD is annoy as hell and it something that take a really long time to figure out and it's different for everyone. Neurotypical people who rarely struggle with stuff like this give themselves slack when they do. So someone with ADHD who struggles most of the time with them should definitely cut themselves some slack.

If you aren't working well you gotta allow yourself slack, tell your teachers you're struggling with the workload, tell them if you haven't already that you have ADHD, figure out what works for you.  Take it a day at a time, make it more fun, the discussion posts are pointless and monotonous? If you like multitasking do it while you're cooking or while you're walking somewhere. Instead of typing, voice record it, ask your teacher if you can submit that instead.  Reflective essays? Do dot points instead; author, dates, quotations you're gonna use, techniques focusing on, likes, dislikes, comparisons etc.

Break it up, plan it, make routine, have lots of breaks, get good sleep, take your meds adjust them so they're right, eat enough and always allow yourself some slack because in the end it's what allows you to maintain your mental health alongside your ADHD.

Also you can definitely ask about provisions and stuff, if you go to your psychiatrist they should be able to give you a letter that allows you to get them at your school. (I've got rest breaks and I'm trying to get extra time).

You're different and you can't change it all you can do is accept it and be proud if it.

"2889","I am new to the diagnosis, but have had this my entire life. While I am still trying to figure out how to control my focus, I am currently taking the following approach.

From what I have been told, ADHD is a dopamine deficit disorder, in that you are in a constant state of low dopamine, and when you see something new, or exciting, or flashy, or rewarding of any sort, you get a strong sense of gravitation toward that particular thing, stronger than normal people because you receiving even a small reward feels like 10x the reward compared to a normal person. Therefore I am trying to use that to my advantage.

I am doing this by first eliminating most detrimental things that are competing for my attention. For example, if there is a TV in the room, I will absolutely not be able to focus because trying to get my task to be more rewarding than a TV is to watch is like trying to get a person to choose broccoli when there is a slice of cake directly next to it. However, if there was only broccoli with maybe some dip with no cake beside it, then most people wouldn't mind eating the broccoli.

Lets talk about the dip. You cannot get someone with ADHD to do something they do not want to do without some dip on the broccoli (atleast myself but I think I speak for most ADHD people). So what is that going to be? It will be different for everyone, but it needs to be convenient, and it needs to be controlled in some manner because asking them to control it themselves will be extremely hard if they are not consciously trying to because we also are extremely impulsive. An example might be gummy bears, if you get him to complete a task, (start out with something very simple) praise him and give him a gummy bear, the praise is to teach him to praise himself which is a reward in itself and can be used long term, while the gummy bear is the boost, because sometimes praise isn't enough. Everytime he completes a task, be SURE to reward him, in order to make this sustainable, start making the tasks slightly harder and harder and harder, eventually you might be able to tap into his hyper focus this way. Whatever the reward is, it must be something that he likes.

(Also side-note: one thing I didn't think about is how old are these kids, the praise thing might come across as demeaning if it isn't tailored towards their age. A 9 year old will love it if you say ""good job you're awesome!"" With enthusiasm, but you will have to start coming up with more intelligent ways of praising the kid if he is older, like 15, if you don't want to come across as condescending.)","e419nqc",2,1534033652,"2018-08-12 00:27:32"

It's a period of grief but doesn't last that long because you suddenly realize what you can do now and life seems full of possibilities. 

The two things you described, reading and listening intently, are not really things I thought I was doing unnaturally. And to be honest, more ""normal"" ppl are doing it nowadays because there are so many things expected of us in the society we are in. But I was also in my 30's, late 30s, when diagnosed.

"2927","I am not diagnosed with ADHD but I will be getting a diagnosis soon as suggested by my doctor, and it's becoming increasingly clear that I have inattentive ADHD. The fact that you mentioned patterns is of extreme interest to me. I happen to have the same idea about music, that it's all patterns, and I have started putting significant mental resources towards developing it further. It is before-all a philosophical explanation of music and a mean to define it, but I am not against the idea that it may be possible to develop it as a means of composing extremely good music as well. ""If I understand music better than anyone else, what's stopping me to make music better than anyone else,"" one could say.

In the music sphere, I define 3 main units: Pitches, Patterns of Pitches, and Mental Expectation Patterns. I consider individual pitches as the absolute/objective unit of sound and they are utterly useless when , patterns as the primary unit of objective music, and expectations as a unit of subjective music. Expectations are non-existent patterns picked up by the listener. For example, a pitch goes up one note every beat; Thus it can be expected to go up +1 in exactly one beat, +2 in two beats, etc. An expectation can be left in suspension, denied or met. I am not quite certain yet, but I believe it's good to classify expectation as a 'Unit of Appreciation', because I suspect there may be other types of appreciations outside of expectations. For example, simply considering the cultural background of the listener may constitute a unique type of musical appreciation. Note: not everyone may pick up on the same patterns or even expectations being set forth by the patterns (usually called having a 'trained ear') which is why we can't say for sure if music is objective or not. My position is that music exists objectively in the world through the occurrence of patterns in sound. However, the enjoyability one has of a particular music varies with the subjective appreciations of the experiencer. 

Finally, we are ready to define music: It is the appreciation of patterns in sound. From the principles drawn above, we can now come to numerous conclusions about music as well as probing for new ideas. For example, how to compose good music? If everything above is true, then aiming to maximize patterns and expectations should in general yield 'good' music, although I'm not sure I would say it is the criterion of good music. If we admit that there is an objective occurrence of music in the world purely through patterns, keeping in mind that expectation patterns are also a type of pattern, then perhaps patterns are the criterion of good music after all. At that point, the rest of the subjective experience doesn't matter. Another question extracted from above: what is the relation between the listening experience and meeting/denying/suspending expectations?

They eventually put me on medication, but my dad resisted at first. He said it was 'unnatural' and didn't make sense to drug me up.

I forget what I'm saying mid-sentence, I cant focus on a teacher for longer than 5 minutes, I take **a week** to adequately clean my relatively small room. I cant remember anything. I have a terrible sense of direction, and despite my dads best efforts, I always forget how to orient myself with the cardinal directions. I ""black out"" so to speak, and I'm in general living in the moment because I cant really remember what just happened. 

I'm going to college for environmental science and I am extremely passionate for my purpose. I am fascinated by medicine, mortuary science, psychology and human nature. My big problem in school is I cant decide what to major in...I want to major in EVERYTHING. Because of my passion and the hands-on nature of my major, I dont have any fears at all about going back to school. I'm passionate about whatever job I work, given I develop a sense of ownership. I can drive just fine, I can live alone just fine, I go to bed on time and wake up on time. I've developed strategies to never be late for an appointment. I've left the stove on a few times, but I'm not dead yet and I usually remember as soon as I step out the door and go through my daily ""checklist"". There is a ""work me"" and a ""personal me"", personal me is much more of a ditzy airhead that gets lost in malls. ""Work me"" has an entirely different set of abilities. I know where I'm going, what I'm doing, what I'm saying. I want to do my job well, and by any means I will *make that happen.*

My dad is doing great, hes a project manager for a software company. He is a fully capable adult, and totally unmedicated. He uses his adhd to his advantage, he ""tricks"" it into working for him

Humans, by nature, are forgetful. There are many many tools for the general population that prove extremely helpful for us. To-do lists, bluetooth trackers, alarms, notes, etc. Help him develop tools and coping mechanisms. A good diet and decent sleep always helps.

I personally recommend teaching him how to take timed breaks to give his brain time to ""release the dam"" so hes more effective. Give him a little extra stimulation in the background, maybe? My 5th grade teacher played soft, instrumental music in the background during work time since he had several adhd students. I've been doing it for myself since and it helps a lot.

It also caused my depression, and for years I didn't know how to be myself on meds, or who I was. I've now learned how to be me, both with and without medication. Medication helps me in my day to day life, however, I also like myself off meds. Maybe not when I'm studying, but when I'm with my best friend or when I'm in a creative flow.

The manic is possibly normal excitement that you've finally figured this out AND you have a working mechanism to help fix it.

Once you've figured out the meds dosage, the next step is to make some solid behavior/habit changes for the better.  Exercise routines, bill routines, time management, calendar use, notes, etc.

- I thought I wanted to be a teacher. I pursued that for a small amount of time, I was fairly good, but it wasn't for me.
- I am now doing accounting. Currently, I am a graduate student. Lots of nervousness over this change. So much attention to detail, studying, and discipline is required. This is why I got myself designated finally. I am a very technical person. 
- My biggest fear is the uncertainty. I want to be working (part time studies, full/part time work) in 6-9 months. I will be a student for another 4 years while I move up in my field toward a full accountant designation. Courses are basically offered on weekends so that I can do studies while working full time.

And it’s not about if anyone else gives a shit if you excell about piano- its about whether you enjoy it- live for yourself not others and people will follow.
I have experienced exactly the same type of thing- failing in school, getting called stupid, lazy- getting mentally abused and gaslighted from my family.. 
it sucks and tnx god we have meds- that work! Many conditions have medication that barely ever work or have shit tons of side effects and some don’t even have any so we can be thankful for that. 
Why im saying I don’t think its right to give a kid stimulants (and this is just my opinion doesn’t mean im right!!) as i have a few friends who grew up on them and they told me that it affects your growth, adrenal glands, appetite and they said it caused them to be depressed as they felt robot like- thing is we dont have any longterm studies on the effects it has on the body and let’s be honest i think feeding speed to a 6 year old because he/she is a bit tricky and not the best at school is just wrong.... its a growing organism with a developing brain and body and we dont even HAVE enough research to suggest if its really safe or not- here in Europe we mostly dont take this lightly and that is reflected by having atleast a physically healthier population.
Ofcourse its not right whatsoever to torment the kid - calling him lazy etc- i think the adhd should be acknowledged and alternate treatments can be started and once the kid is old enough to think for himself he can decide whether he wants that or not- i think its cruel to potentially ruin a childs body/brain/beart (minimal chances but still) just because he/she is difficult to tame and doesn’t excel at school.

"3048","I had this realization tonight while doing my math homework, trigonometry.

Earlier that day I had met with my math teacher since my grades have been dropping quite badly and I've been wanting to meet with him for a while. He was very direct and straightforward about the situation and said simply that, ""I understand you're having trouble in Math this year, and I know you've been suffering in other classes as well. From looking through your work I know that some things click and some don't. Understandable. What we are going to do is go through the things you don't understand and work better to improve those areas.""

Boom. Nothing like, ""Oh we'll give you another month or so to work on the assignments I'll hand out this week so you'll have more time,"" or, ""We can move you down another class so you can improve your grades elsewhere...""

Simple. Work on where you are struggling, problem solved.

And it worked. Instead of avoiding the teacher because of being afraid of how he'll react when you have no idea what we've learned for the past couple of months, you talked to him directly about your situation and the teacher complied. How was that so hard?

This is what I'm talking about; I think there are more obvious and simple solutions than trying to stick it out with medicine and blaming everything on the ADHD/ADD.

This was today. I've been on Wellbutrin for half a year now and I can say it's been helping me work for longer hours without freaking out, but not any faster. I've been able to focus in class longer, but maybe not on all the appropriate things.

Now when I don't take it, I remember how I used to be before I took the medication. It seems much worse since I'm not used to it, but I understand that I used to ignore my panic attacks and try to go with the flow.

My fault was that I didn't do anything about it. Not that I didn't rely on somebody else to tell me what was wrong with me. I knew damn well what I was doing wrong but too afraid and ashamed to say so.

Now I am correcting that on my own, without the thought of ADD on my mind. That is what I'm trying to introduce. Correcting these problems that do not have to be associated with ADHD/ADD. Can we have a little faith in ourselves?

And that is what I'm doing. Changing my life. But not changing those around me and vise-versa. And I'll do the things that I'm good at, but there are some core values that you cannot ignore. One being how to learn and retain information. This is extremely subjective and you need to truly know yourself and understand how you function in order to learn correctly and efficiently.","c8mh1m8",1,1361946789,"2013-02-27 06:33:09"

"3050","TL;DR : Your girlfriend is just trying to communicate with you and it sucks that it hurts your feelings and your feel rejected, but it’s for the best. Continue your interests and journal about it and write reddit posts about it! 
———————————————————

This might be a little unpopular, but I really think you should not listen to the people on here that are saying your girlfriend or your roommate are terrible for telling you that they don’t want to hear about your toaster anymore. I know that it is hard when you are hyperfocusing on something and you’re passionate about it not to talk excessively about it, but ultimately at a certain limit it becomes a little selfish to try to keep talking about something no one else really wants to hear about. 

It’s like, think of something you really don’t care about, maybe it’s history or a math proof a the inner workings of a car, and then imagine someone was constantly trying to talk to you about it in detail when you don’t really understand what they’re talking about and you have little interest in it.

You just need to find a balance. You can talk to your girlfriend about your hyperfocusing interests, just make sure to put a time limit on it and to limit the number of times you bring it up and how much detail you go into about it. Try to give her summaries instead of the full story. You may just need to find someone else in your life with a shared engineering interest or refurbishing interest to talk to about it. You could also likely find a Reddit community specifically for people who are specifically interested in these types of projects to gush about it with. The internet is a great place! Journaling and reddit posting can be a great way to talk about your hyperfocusing interests without bothering your friends and significant other.

Don’t take it personally! This is a thing that every person with ADHD goes through at some point. It’s not your fault and it doesn’t mean anyone in your life likes you any less or is rejecting you. Medication helps with rejection sensitive dysphoria in my opinion. Don’t quit your passions just because you can’t share all the details of your process with your roommate and girlfriend. Your passions are for you to get satisfaction from, they’re not for them. They may not understand it and that’s okay because the internet is a large place and other people will.","fyajd3y",2,1594932944,"2020-07-16 20:55:44"

It actually makes me more obsessive compulsive actually. Oh and it makes me type alot and go off topic. Safe to say though being on a medication without having ADHD isn't fun. It truly did help me a lot early on but I've had my fun with it and I know I haven't caused any permanent harm to myself with it. I can't wait to srop taking it. It doesn't feel right either.

I recommend the story of Job (who had everything stripped away from him), doesn't really end happily but it's nice to know that a man that the Bible sees in a good light struggled more than anyone, maybe ever.","eelp9hj",1,1548053349,"2019-01-21 06:49:09"

Even if we do acknowledge those questions, it sometimes just helps to have someone outside ourselves raise them. This whole experience, though short all things considered, has been rather enlightening in even unexpected ways so I thank you again for allowing me that opportunity to grow as a person.   


These are all great suggestions and I believe this will be my approach when I get to see her this weekend. She's pre-med and has a lot on her plate this week so I dont want to drop this on her now out of consideration for her situation, but this aside I think its a conversation better had in person over text as it does deal with vulnerability which seems to be counter to the pseudo-anonymity you can feel communicating things over text.   


You're right; one cannot gain something without having to face the inevitable possibility of losing that thing. That is a reality.  I'm unsure if you resonate with this sentiment or not, but the reason I dont ""date around"" much boils down to two main factors and has nothing to do with my ability to do so: 1) I'm close with a lot of people in ways, but with romantic prospects I find few deep/interesting/intelligent enough to keep me interested long term 2) As a result, I dont engage when interest is shown as I dont want to hurt anyone's feelings unnecessarily so it is simply better to focus on the few and far between that I do find ""interesting"" as shallow and arrogant as that sounds-which I do not intend for it to be received that way. We share the same sentiment in regards to your last statement: it does not fit my moral compass as I consider that to be an intense bonding experience and I do not want to bond or share my body with just anyone; but that is simply my truth and I dont judge others who do. It has no impact on my life so I do not focus on it lol   


Thank you! I try to be moderately self aware and acknowledge that my frontal lobe is just now fully developed. Its a weird age in which you are kinda stuck/transitioning from more childlike behaviors and thought patterns to the adult you will become. Though even then we are forever evolving. That sentiment likely will be tempered and I agree fully with what you expressed about vulnerability. Macho man bs probably wasnt a great descriptor of the actual nature of the beast as your example is far more fitting lol   


Even beyond intimate relationships this is a problem for me. I think this stems from spending most of my life as a caretaker/giver\^ (personally and now professionally) for other people and for whatever reason rationalized that to do so effectively I must keep emotions/weak points tucked deep inside in order to fulfill my perceived role more effectively. This was furthered by traumatic experiences within that role and being taken advantage of by some of those I did help-even at a cost to myself. Ironically, I often advocate for people not to do that. &amp; rightfully so as it is unhealthy and destructive. I recognize this is a weak point in my personal dynamic and as I continue to grow as a person I am trying to work on being more ok with expressing these things. It helps that some of my loved ones have expressed wanting me to do this so they can get to know ""the real me"" so I'm trying. In honesty, it'll probably make me more effective in my role as well as we all do have emotions and vulnerabilities and being strong enough to express them earnestly makes you more relatable and can expand your impact to the people you're trying to help. I'll probably always struggle with it to an extent, but that doesnt mean I shouldnt try to fix it.   


As it isnt relevant to our dialogue, I will save you the particulars on the relationship timeline. Your insight was great and incredibly valuable regardless. I suspect that she does suffer from some form of anxiety which is why I felt bad about my adderall fueled gutter mouth. When she was finally done with all of her schoolwork and could respond to me, we picked up without missing a beat. She didnt even comment on my text dissertations and let me know she missed me blah blah blah so it truly was just all in my head. I think sometimes she does give herself a break from me over texts which is understandable and respectable as... again.. I know I can be a lot lol I also admire her for doing that as she hasnt dated a ton either and this seems to be her intuitive way of managing the situation.   


Emotions are odd indeed. I'm generally pretty emotionally neutral so those weird fluxes were strange. Much better today though as I'm almost a week in to the transition; still find myself getting choked up at inspiring notions which is kinda funny and not too bad. Sounds like the two of us could write an entire encyclopedia together if we ever joined forces. Mothers definitely have that potential though and I'm glad you got to speak to her.   


Dude, I really appreciate you. You took time out of your day to help me as a total stranger with no benefit to yourself and I have the distinct feeling that you are just a genuinely kind and awesome person. I do not know your life story or circumstances by any means but if there is anything you ever need to discuss and I can return the favor please let me know. I hope you have a wonderful and kick-ass day my man.

"3103","&gt;Also, I had more structure in high school and my mother worked at my high school so she was keeping track of how well I was doing in all of my classes. 

I was just about to ask the original poster what his home life was like when he was in high school; how much were his parents involved in his studies, specifically. I was then going to ask if the psychiatrist bothered to ask this question.

My guess is the answers to the questions are 1.) alot and 2.) no. If I am correct, then I think we can agree that the psychiatrist is culpably uninterested. 

Parental involvement can make all the difference in the world in a child's success in school, especially for a child with ADHD. To use a personal example: My father has ADHD. He grew up in an all-american nuclear family with his younger sister. His father was tall, athletic, and the superintendent of the school district, and his mother was a petit firebrand of school teacher. She also had the worst case of ADHD I've seen in my life, but that story is for a different post. Both parents stressed the importance of school and made sure my dad performed in class, my dad's teachers worked for his dad, and with these advantages he eventually graduated third in his class, was voted most likely to succeed, and got into a prestigous college and later into a more prestigious med school.

I have ADHD as well. I got it from both of my parents. I grew up in a broken home with 3 siblings and 2 stepsiblings (Surprise! An ADHD couple had trouble with commitment!). I did not receive the same amount of attention or support from my overworked, stressed parents. I also had 3 different stepmothers throughout my school career, so I wouldn't say my home life was very stable. Despite having similar test scores with my dad, as well a personality very much like my dad's, I graduated in the bottom quarter of my high school class. Family connections came through and got me into my dad's alma mater, where I made a hash of my grades and eventually failed out. 

So having experienced that, I think parental involvement can more than make up for any deficits due to ADHD when it comes to schooling. I realize this is a personal anecdote and thus irrelevant in the world of evidence based medicine, but if a proper study would (or could) be made, I'd be surprised to find that this wasn't the case.

I got Reddit notifications... do some online banking... oh shit I should be literally leaving for work right now and I'm still in bed surfing. 

I received a Google home mini for xmas which is my new alarm, and I've programmed it to spend 15 minutes telling me news highlights. By that point, I'm awake... and if I have no other devices in the room, bored enough to get up and start getting ready.

"3120","This is not just general relationship advice: talk about your relationships, the things that you like and dislike, deeply and often. He may want to explore solutions, and you should play it by ear whether or not it is valuable to do so, but that is not the important part of the conversation. The important part is that by talking about it regularly, you will build an awareness of the good, the bad, and the ugly in his and your minds. It will not be limited to a specific memory if you do it often enough, and if you make it part of a routine he will probably start thinking about what works between you and what doesn't at other times as well. 

If it gets too off-topic, steer it back gently, but don't force it if any particular instance of the conversation becomes too stressful for either of you - just say ""we'll pick it back up next time"" or suchlike and go wherever the conversation goes.

Be aware that he will forget things you have talked about, and he will misapply things. eg, you talk about how you don't like it when he cuts you off and suddenly he starts walking only beside or behind you. Maybe that's a stupid example.

Learn to tune him out. This is not rude as long as you discuss it with him (some time before you start tuning him out, preferably). It will save you a lot of attention and it will save him a lot of self-control. I sometimes need to store that stuff up and I'm pretty mild.

Learn to be tuned out by him. This one can kind of hurt, but it's not an insult nor is it related to you at all. He's thinking about other things that probably were at one point related to something you said earlier but now it is further separated than even Kevin Bacon can explain.

On that note, learn to deal with off-the-cuff comments that make no sense at all. They often come from a wandering train of thought that comes back to you somehow. (conversation about birds, birds fly by extending their wings: the relaxed wing position is folded, there are some positions in chess that are impossible to arrive at in a normal game, is there an algorithmic way to test for that, how does one code on a mac computer when they hide all of the behind-the-scenes stuff from you, that scene in the Wizard of Oz was weird: there really is magic capable of projecting a giant face so why did the level of technology capable of doing that develop, the poppy scene was weird too but it made more sense because poppies make opium, actually it's the seeds, many seeds are poisonous, cherry seeds sure are, maybe Guttercherry knows why the Wizard has access to holograms, ASK). Just... just go with it.

Don't try to solve his ADHD problems, he has systems. If he asks, go ahead and help, but don't offer it. Even if you come up with a useful system for him, he won't use it unless he's receptive, which usually means he came up with it. If he asks for help, that means he's in that rare mood where he can focus on and treat seriously a solution proposed by someone else. Also it means he trusts you to know him well enough to have the context for a good solution.

Mostly the right thing to do is talk about stuff frequently and be open with information, even if he already has it.","c7x2pjs",4,1358218344,"2013-01-15 02:52:24"

Don’t be too hard on yourself.  Shit happens.  Here’s some recent dumb anecdotes for you:

For instance, I did the opposite of you today.  Sleepily downed 3 mg of melatonin instead of the similar-looking Wellbutrin pill.  Some mornings I have to count remaining pills because I can’t remember if I just took the pill 20 seconds ago. 

I think it’s an autopilot problem.  Routines are boring, so we check out and think about something else.  Left my purse in a Subway last night.  Only reason I knew that was because I do an I’m-an-idiot check before leaving places.  Phone, keys, purse.

Oh, and 15 minutes before that I ran out to the car and walked someone’s phone back in.  I had a random thought while walking back that must have derailed me, because I looked down at the phone and said, huh, when did I get a scratch right there?  Then the home screen lit up and reminded me it was someone else’s phone.

WTF?

"3174","Well it similiar to Aspergers and Autism. The disorder has been combined in to one disorder Autism spectrum disorder.  The reasons for it are quite simple. The symptoms exhibited in ADD and ADHD are both assumed to be related to the same cause. The cause is the an underlying endemic dopamine defiency. As such they both are basically the same disorder just with different representations. 

This sort of representation can even change throughout live someone predominantly hyperactive can change into predominantly inattentive etc. So really since even the treatment is the same and works for every symptom associated with ADHD, whether it is hyperactivity, impulsivity or attention regulation deficit. As such there is no need to separate between the different representations. Nowadays the right terminology is ADHD predominantly Inattentive, ADHD predominantly hyperactive and ADHD combined type.

It has not changed a lot to be honest and a huge majority still uses the old terms. 

The cause is the same. The treatment is the same. Only the problems tend to differ depending on the type representation. So from a diagnostic standpoint there is no reason to separate the different representations of symptoms. 

Its not really a big changer to be honest. Think of it that way now you are part of an even larger community :D

Your mom is in the wrong for assuming that you’re not your true self unless you’re medicated, just like she would be wrong for saying that someone who regularly wears glasses is less themselves for taking them off.

"3193","You're off to a much better start than I was. I was diagnosed as a child but went untreated. I coasted through high school and undergrad, but started to struggle a bit during my masters. I still did well enough to get into a phd program, but I had already allowed myself to fall behind in courses that were prerequisites for a lot of the phd courses. Things were really rough for the first several years of the phd. My classmates would spend hours everyday working on assignments, but I could only work up the focus to get in an hour or two. I passed my written exams, just barely scraped by on my oral exams, and then hit a wall when I started researching. It took another year of paying out of pocket for psychiatric visits and fighting with the on campus clinic to get a diagnosis and medication. It turns out that a lot of psychiatrists don't believe it is possible to make it that far unmedicated and still have ADHD. Things are finally getting better, but it is still an uphill battle.

Now for the actual advice. First and foremost, be honest with yourself about why you are in the program and whether or not you are happy. Obviously the years you spend in the program will be stressful, and you'll probably spend a decent chunk of time down on yourself, but, if you find yourself hating every second of it, be honest with yourself about it. I'm certainly not saying drop out if you find yourself in that situation (although it isn't the end of the world if you do), but my single greatest regret about the past 5 years is not acknowledging my discontent and working to make a change for the better. 

Second, try to be honest with yourself about your academic progress. I spent too many years telling myself that I was fine, I just needed to review a little bit. Imposter syndrome is bad enough without as it is; it is emotionally devastating if your performance is even a little deficient. I would be in a much better position today if I had sought professional help earlier. I know you are already medicated, but it is still important. Coping methods that worked for you during your masters program might not work so well now. That's not to say it'll be a lot harder; it's just different, and the pace is faster. A few sessions with a therapist went a long way for me once I had my medication sorted out. 

On a related note, if your advisor is reasonably approachable, be honest if you are struggling. In my experience, most professors have abandoned the ""I suffered every step of the way, so you will too"" attitude and are good about acknowledging that ADHD is a real disorder that requires some accommodation. A surprising number of them struggle with it themselves. I spent too long dreading every meeting with my advisor because I hadn't been able to focus long enough to get anything done. After a while, the anxiety became just as much of an obstacle as the ADHD itself. Everything got better once I decided to be up front about the fact that I knew something was wrong and was seeking help to get it under control.

Finally, with regards to basic life management and social skills, I don't have a ton of advice, but I have figured out some things that work for me. I have a hard time consistently doing it, but exercise helps a lot. I am all around better functioning if I exercise at least a couple of days a week. Not eating like crap also helps a lot. The times when I have spent everyday in a fog have consistently been the times I was eating the least and the worst. I always thought I didn't have time to prepare decent meals for myself, but I save so much time not being in a daze that I come out ahead in the long run if I stay on top of my diet. My room is usually a mess, but for some reason my days are a lot better if I start out by making my bed. Socially, I've found that most phd students are pretty maladapted. It's a really weird social scene because your classmates end up being your friends and coworkers, so a work/non-work social dichotomy is pretty hard to maintain. I do wish I had been better about networking and meeting new people in general. No real advice there other than realize it will probably be uncomfortable and do it anyway. 

Reading what I just wrote, it seems like it's all really obvious, but I learned all of it the hard way. Hopefully at least some of it is useful for you or someone else reading this. ","dlhncjl",4,1502481028,"2017-08-11 19:50:28"

I'd just wish people here would be more open to the idea of using less than perscribed.. I myself have found that blood levels of approx 15mg is required for good concentration, below 12mg gets progressively worse, and going above 20mg is either unnecessary, or even if necessary -- will just make me groggy the following days. Keeping blood levels around 10-15mg for most of the day requires around 15-25mg daily intake.","gt4lseu",1,1617358676,"2021-04-02 10:17:56"

If you're insecure about your symptoms, try to make list of personal examples.  Take the list with you, just to have a back-up in case you blank out during the meeting. Google symptom lists for adults and use them as a starting point. Many have examples that can help you recognize fitting situations in your life.

"3219","“I try to act as though I know what I’m doing and I’m comfortable around people...” I felt this so very much deep in my soul.  We are “weird” from time to time — everything is going great with a group of new people until it suddenly isn’t and you’re on the outside. You don’t understand why except that it must have been something you’d done and it hurts.  Over time, you try harder to act normal — you think about your body language, their body language, you’re anxious to stand out and to fit in ... and the cycle continues until either (a) you get good enough at the social chameleon game to ‘pass’ as normal and/or (b) you start to find the people who value you for you, weird as you are, and you (eventually) believe them and find a way to be comfortable being yourself. 

One thing I didn’t realize was how many opportunities and relationships I was missing or losing because I wasn’t comfortable being genuine and vulnerable — especially with mentors.  Looking back, I see a lot of great people who wanted to help me grow, but I was so busy pretending I knew what I was doing that I never let them in.  

Also, even when I would let people in, it was usually only to the foyer — a curated bit of my personality with all the messy bits swept away behind the doors.

"3234","Marijuana is still federally illegal, and because Adderall is a schedule two substance, a doc could get in serious trouble (depending on the state their license is from) if they knowingly prescribe it to someone using a schedule one substance. Most docs don't care nowadays, but you'll get the few who feel it necessary to take those precautions. My VA prescribing doc cares a shit ton, but she's young and in a state where recreational marijuana is relatively new, and because she is employed by a federally funded and managed agency, she has to watch her back. I respect that enough to smoke only for migraines now, so when I go in for an appointment, I can test clean. 

There is also the chance that mixing the two could trigger psychosis. Since most people coming in for mental health reasons don't know enough about their family's mental health history (undiagnosed/unreported/hidden from rest of family/etc) it is a good idea to keep clean of other things for a while when starting a stimulant. Yeah, it's only a five percent chance that people who smoke will experience psychosis, but the risk is raised when it is combined with other mental health issues.

There also isn't enough testing/information on interactions for most doctors to be able to say, ""yeah go ahead, do what you want."" Most will warn against marijuana the same way they do alcohol while on medications, because there can be bad interactions. Marijuana just happens to be stressed more/harder because it is new to the scene and there are little to no long term, journal reviewed studies when it comes to medication interaction, like there is with alcohol. 

Another concern doctors have to deal with is that weed can, and is used, by people with ADHD to manage symptoms. If your symptoms are bring well managed by one thing, why would they change/add anything?

2. I was very good at school, but I completely hated it since the first grade. I had to cry and force my mom to come with me one day because I didn't want to go. I came to the US in third grade, and by next year I was out of ESL and placed advanced in every category. Got into GATE as well. But that didn't matter. Having to take classes you hate year after year and being forced to do stupid assignments for a grade you don't care bout was never a motivation for me. I could be on the computer and not get off until I figured something out and got it just right, all while starving myself, but I couldn't do 30 minutes of homework. I suppose we just have different attitudes and personalities because I found everything in school insanely pointless and a waste of time, and consequently couldn't be bothered by it.

3. Yeah, ""I'll just do better next time!"" is what I been saying every semester, every year. I keep taking harder and more challenging work load because ""I'll just start really doing the homework the day its assigned and attend SI sessions!"" but it doesn't happen. In senior year, I took 6 classes, 4 of them APs, and on top of that 2 college courses. Never did more than 20 minutes of homework a day.

What job are you exactly doing that you find so rewarding? I feel like I need a constant challenge. As soon as something becomes repetitive, I am lost.

"3276","I'm an artist in the video game industry and I have this exact problem. Currently from the unemployed and working on portfolio for a new job phase in my life right now.  I make sure to write a to-do list every day and put a art portfolio task on it everyday. It helps me anchor my whole day around a set of prioritized tasks, so I can attempt to ignore the non-prioritized tasks.  

Also, I personally find breaking up my big project stuff helps me best while I find the right medication for me that way I can make some progress over no progress. It doesn't work for me everyday, but it helps me move my projects somewhere rather than nowhere. 

 For example, I have a mural in my portfolio level that's working on. I broke it into a bunch of sub-tasks like: 1) Open Photoshop, 2) Find reference photo filee, 3) Open project file, 4) Design mural for 1-hour using pomodoro timer, etc.

As for distractions, I also have a website blocker called Cold Turkey that limits my usage of certain trouble sites. I also have headphones on and close my door. It doesn't stop people from entering, but significantly lowers the chances and I also can't hear the ongoings outside the door. I also am a big fan of timers, because it keeps me from deviating tasks.

"3283","I keep a notebook with EVERYTHING in it, including my daily to-do list. [Here is a sample](http://imgur.com/G8uxMAQ) of what my to-do list looks like. 

Here is the order of operations for me to make the to-do list

1. Add the Day and Date
2. Make a general time bar at the top for all 24 hours. 
3. Make time blocks for the basic stuff like sleep and my AM and PM routines. I add in if I am having any sit-down meals.
4. List my appointments, meetings and hangouts with the time. (I always make it 15 minutes before I'm supposed to be there.)
5. Make time blocks for the appointments, meetings and hangouts. I factor in commuting time.

Now I can see what time I have left in the day. Usually this instills a CRAAAAAAP feeling when I realize that ""all day"" really means just a few hours. (Yes, I come to this realization EVERY FRIGGIN' DAY)

6. Now I make my to-do list down the right side of the page. After I make the list, I rank everything A,B or C in order of priority. Then I give each ranking a number like A1, A2, A3 to determine the order I do things in. 
7. Next, I find time on the time bar, starting with the A tasks. (I can immediately see that I'm not going to get through everything today so I can manage my expectations and plan to do the remaining stuff tomorrow.)
8. When it's time to start working, I add each task to the ""Doing"" section as I'm doing them. This is ONE AT A TIME. I often forget what I'm doing while I'm doing it (even with Vyvanse), so I keep it very simple and don't allow myself to add the next thing until I finish the first thing. When I finish something, I color in the dot. I also cross it off of the to-do list. I like having the ""doing list"" because at the end of the day I can see what I actually got done.

It's not a perfect system, but it's the best I've got right now. I'm trying to coordinate it with a master to-do list too so I don't jumble up each day with too much stuff I that I know I'm not going to be able to get to. 

(I also use an erasable pen because I make a lot of mistakes!! I've you're going to do that, just don't leave your to-do list anywhere hot because the erasable ink will fade/disappear! Ack!)

"3291","What I've learned:
1) Write a summary of your committee meetings to your committee so there is a written record and email it to them to confirm they agree with it.

2)Know your chair, if things happen do not be afraid to reach out to first your trusted committee members then your chair.

3) Have paperwork registered with your Disability office. This can actually be frowned upon because of the fact your degree is usually contingent on you meeting faculty requirements. Ignore those who frown upon it and keep pushing hard. The graduate school on your side is worth more than your department in some specific cases. As long as you have a committee that supports you don't worry about others.

4) It also wouldn't hurt to know who your ombudsman at the graduate school is so you have a point of contact for help if you need it. 

5) Get Mendeley for citations it allows you to search in documents for things you haven't gotten sorted yet and is amazing for the organization we need.

6) If you need to read abstracts first for deadlines and make sure you know inside and out those papers you really need. IE Mass reading, skim -&gt;for those important areas take a lot of time to read.

7) As far as grading goes be sure to take 6-7x more time than everyone else. Students will usually catch exam mistakes but it's not fair to them if you don't take the time.

Reading reviews, checking out comments on different discussion boards, checking more reviews, research research research! 

And on our way to the store to look at the pairs I had halfway decided on, we pop in a random shoe store that sell cheap shoes and the lady there comes at us like “whatcha lookin’ for? Wellies? We have these here, they’re all 200 (like $22), you probably need this size here, nope too small, try these, do you like those (to my nodding daughter), well great, let’s ring’em up!”, and out we went with a bag of cheap wellies wondering wtf just happened? 

And hey, the wellies are fine. They’re wellies. They keep water out. But I still worry, what if they’re too heavy? What if they’re poor quality? What if they suck to wear on long walks? (We’ll find out today). I just can’t stop with the fucking wellies. I don’t obsess or anything, but the fact that I think about it at all just annoys me. Let it go!

It also applies to things that require planning and physical energy, for myself at least. 

For example, I love cleaning, I love the feeling of a clean house and the process is so satisfying. The dopamine payoff is fantastic. Yet I can often feel ""paralysis"" when I'm in bed and I know I need to clean because it takes an extra level of physical and sustained effort. It gets so bad that I will lay in bed the entire day and take like 4 naps just to avoid it. The only thing that gets me out of bed is the severe anxiety and self hatred that comes with a dirty house, especially with having two cats in a 600 sq. ft. apartment.

"3328","Depends on the library and the position. Smaller libraries will hire people without a specific library degree for many positions but they unless they are tiny are usually required by their states library commission to have a certain number of people certified as librarians. That certification can be different things in different states.

My library’s service area is about 24,000 which is considered on the large size of a small/rural library out of my 17 coworkers including myself 4 of us have a library degree of some type. One of our aides is getting her Masters in Library Science and will be leaving us at some point after she finishes getting it. 

Most of the positions that do not require a degree are part time and low pay. For the most part you are not going to get a cataloging job without either experience in cataloging and one of the computer systems called ILS used or a degree. Other positions like acquisitions/processing, InterLibrary Loan or in our case Assistant Children’s Librarian may or may not require a library degree or might be able to be filled by someone with at least a bachelors and so kind of relevant experience. 

Also if you happen to be bilingual in lots of areas that can increase your chances in some positions if you have a bachelors and some kind of experience that would help.

Be honest with yourself, and with him. Is there anything he can do to salvage the situation? If so, tell him what it is, set clear guidelines and see if he follows through. If there's nothing he can do OR you can't be clear about what you want from him, move on.

My dad on the other hand brought religion into the whole picture and tells me that I don't pray enough and that I need to go to church (wtf?). That's my dad though. He's a religious nut. 

I have not told my workplace yet as I'm not sure if it is a good idea or not. I will tell the guy that I shoot weddings with because we have been working together for a long while and he is quite understanding. I have not told any friends or coworkers.

So, I think it is really up to you who you tell. It is tough because it requires thought beforehand and preparation of materials to help them understand what it's like to have ADHD. I took my test results to my family members so they could see exactly what the psychologist said. Some people just won't get it, and that's ok. Just because they don't get it doesn't mean that you are wrong, weird, stupid, or anything else. You are YOU. And that's OK. Knowing about having ADHD just helps you understand better how to work with things that are difficult to do and be more aware of areas that need improvement to succeed in what you want to do.

Around that time, I was playing with a band that was just getting started. We played shitty hotel bar gigs to stay tight in between ""real"" gigs. Even in that shithole, when we would get on stage, bad feelings and distractions would all go away for a while.

"3387","It can produce a stronger effect in the first few weeks of use. Stimulation effects can last longer than 8 hours, which is why it's often recommended you don't plan to be able to go to bed right at 8 hours. It's probably that your body isn't used to stimulants yet. Be mindful of this when choosing what time to take your dose in the morning. It is easy to lose control of your sleep schedule, which is disastrous, despite how ""worth it"" it feels in the moment.

Edit: I'll add that you should consider it can take up to about an hour to metabolize in the beginning, but I wouldn't expect much more delay than this. With XR, half the medicine metabolizes in the beginning and the other half is time released to about four hours. It's likely you're feeling the effects of the tail end, an unexpected boost. It's easy to feel the stimulation effects drag out when your body is being stimulated at unusual times like early morning. I recommend you do your best to maintain sleep hygiene habits despite the lingering effects of the medication. Take a shower, brush your teeth, whatever to signal to your brain that it's bedtime. Like if you drank soda before bed, sleep might not be immediate, but you're going to feel its effects more strongly if you're up playing games or working and using back-lit screens.","dfjxvtw",1,1490784946,"2017-03-29 10:55:46"

* Less is more.
* Methylphenidate sucks due to the PNS effects. UK needs D-MPH as soon as.
* You *might* get cigarette cravings. Get Nicotine in another form. I found walking also helps reduce the cravings - or rather anxiety from MPH.

Also hard to sleep with how fucking *noisy* they are, and I got a fairly ""quiet"" model!) to move forward with that. Like, I was told flat-out that unless I underwent another study with them, with a PAP, without improvement of symptoms, they *would not* do any other tests or otherwise consider anything else. Not even CSF analysis to look for chemical signs of narcolepsy.","gvzpiec",2,1619480769,"2021-04-26 23:46:09"

* Verapamil ER 240mg (Migraine Prophylaxis)
* Montelukast 10mg (Asthma)
* Ranitidine 150mg (Reflux)

And as needed:

* Tramadol + Rizatriptan (migraine abortive)
* Butalbital (Less serious migraine abortive)
* Ondansetron (Migraine associated nausea)
* Ergotamine (Not really using this anymore since it sucks)
* Albuterol (Asthma)

I see a neurologist every few months who specializes in migraine at the local headache clinic, so I doubt he would be comfortable managing ADHD for me (could be wrong, I really have no idea how much exposure doctors have to this).

The reason I am still taking the clonidine is because it's been a really rough couple of migraine months for me and I'm hopeful that it will have additive effects with the verapamil which is a calcium channel blocker.

It's just frustrating because I feel like my PCP will see this as drug seeking or something, but really I just want the best treatment possible for me.  A lot of the drugs I'm taking / considering are serotonin acting as well, so I need to be careful to avoid serotonin syndrome.

my buddy and I realized that the people on the street were only ever rude or obnoxious when you gave of the air of a foreign tourist.

Except those street hustlers, they bother everyone, but you just keep walking and they go on to their next mark soon enough. 

But, yeah, if you're a super touristy type, Parisians are going to seem offensive. The rest of the country, Loire, Nice, Normandy... Great places to be a tourist. 

I figured that, these people *live* here.

"3468","Before I forget?  *Have you looked into Oppositional Defiant Disorder?*  One of the most common comorbidities with ADHD?

If your child is ODD and ADHD, it is so fucking exhausting.  Everyone in the family suffers, for no one knows how to fix the problems and you just keep pushing her buttons and she frustrates you in return (anger, exhaustion, defiance, etc)

You just feel so empty.

If this is the case understand that is okay to feel broken, but you need to learn what are the tactics you need to do to fix ODD on your end, and what type of expectations you should have for your daughter.

If this sounds like your daughter pay particular attention to 1B of the 30 essential ideas video I linked you earlier.  Especially around minute 6 when he talks about ODD.  [This Video lecture](http://www.lynn.edu/academics/institute/resources/transitions/transitions-2014/the-importance-of-emotion-in-understanding-and-managing-adhd) which I have not linked to yet to you, [and these slides](http://www.lynn.edu/academics/institute/docs/transitions-2014/barkley-1345)  are something you need to pay attention if your kid is ODD.

ODD is far worse in ADHD kids with parents who have untreated ADHD and/or they have untreated Depression.  Why?  Because the family members feed on each other, and they emotionally push each other's buttons and drain your ability to emotionally self regulate.  Like some vampire sapping your emotional reserves.

Thus learning about ODD can stop the defiance, but also make everyone in the family happier, more energetic, and they love and trust each other better for they do not need to feel to keep an emotional wall up all the time out of self protection.","cokxp9t",3,1423881895,"2015-02-14 02:44:55"

Its like I can actually be present in the conversation rather than obsessing over what I just said and what I'm about to say.

Ugh, total opposite. I think Vyvanse gives me the social anxiety you describe. Plus, conversations (to me) are distractions from what I actuallu should/want (e.g., work and video games) to be doing. Every conversation is boring to me on meds.

When I'm off my meds, I actually become more impulsive to the point where I'm rude. When a patient paused after I asked him ""how are you,"" I filled the silence with, ""just hanging on?"" These are old guys with heart problems; I can't just say  that. Ididn't even mean it that way, I just meant as in ""going through the motions."" He was really nice about it at least.

Likely: I would get it working and demoed Thursday and I'll have to pitch it next week. Delay doesn't hinder progress. My ultimate deadline for the project is before summer start.

Pack my son's and my lunches for the week. He doesn't mind plain AF ham and cheese sandwiches. It takes a bit more to fulfill my lunch wishes so I'll make a big batch of rice and beans for mine.

Aside from that, I've got a home cleaning schedule that keeps me satisfied. Monday the kitchen gets deep cleaned and I do our clothing laundry. Tuesday is bathrooms and towels day. Wednesday is living room and dining room. Thursday is Master bedroom. Friday is the child's room and his laundry. Each day, I reload the dishwasher, wipe the kitchen counters, and clean the cat litter.

Hygiene-wise, I'd like to get back to using the vibrating toothbrush at least once a day. It's just sometimes I don't like the pulses. But I do like the feeling after wards.

He's very sensitive though so once he realizes what he's done, he starts sobbing uncontrollably and says things like ""Why can't I just be a good kid? I try so hard."" and it makes me so sad.

He doesn't respond like that when he is doing something bad on purpose, he just says 'sorry' and accepts the punishment. But if I change the punishment for impulse behavior, I'm worried he'll think ""Oh, I should just start crying and then I won't get in trouble""


Edit: For impulse behavior, I talk to him and tell him why he can't do x or y and what he should try next time. He gets snuggles, then he is sent to his room to relax and comes back once he's calmed down.

I get angry at my alarm but then remember all I have to do is take a sip of water and go back to sleep. The meds usually kick in, burn off the brain fog and more ""naturally"" (lol) wake me up about 15-30 mins before original wake-up time as well.

Many people use IR ""booster"" doses in the *afternoon* (in conjunction with XR in the morning) to prolong the effective life of the drug without affecting sleep as much as two XR doses would, but doing the opposite (IR early in the morning, XR around 11am) works well for me.

"3560","I devised a method for school that involves focusing more on the big picture, as opposed to the small details. In order for information to stick in your brain, it has to have something to connect to. Learning should be a structure or a network you develop in your mind. It's just like constructing a building, you start with a plan, build the foundation, install the support beams, connect the horizontal floors, etc. If you're studying on the granular or micro-level, it's like trying to put windows into new construction without the framing, they'd just fall to the ground and break apart! 

Instead, pull your focus waaaaaay out in your mind so you can see the whole of something. Take microbiology, don't just dive into the details, find a perspective or point of vision that makes connections. Let's say you're interested in how diseases are a component of microbiology, you'd analyze all the points of reference (say how diseases spread, if climate is a factor, or cultural phenotypes, or diet in a population, or soil analysis related to geography, etc.). Then as you're studying, your mind is making connections to what you're learning and your studying becomes more automatic. The big picture or structure becomes the engine as your mind - on its own - begins to fill in the details. 

If you do this already, then maybe spend more time trying to make connections between pieces of information. You can't just let information sit in your mind like a silo...it has to be like a snippet of gossip that spreads around a high school like wildfire. The more the fire spreads, the more powerful and all consuming it gets (sorry if that sounded a little too Jedi there, like something Yoda would say...lol)!

"3568","Hey, youlovethunder, I hear what you're saying and here's my take on why feminism is more appropriate right now than equalism. I hope you don't mind if I tackle each of your examples head-on? 
First thought: many of the examples you provide come from a root in patriarchal society that teaches us that ""traditional"" masculinity should be valued and femininity is worthless.
The violence (and the suicide)- Men are expected to be stoic and not talk about emotions, and certainly they can never cry. And why can't they cry? Because it's womanly, it's girly, and therefore a source of shame. So men hold in emotions, which can be extremely damaging, which leads to higher risk-taking, shorter tempers, and a decreased emotional capacity (arrgh can't find the more nuanced phrase I'm looking for). And people with a lower emotional capacity (of an gender) tend to be more violent when working through conflicts. All because emoting is womanly and weak. 
I'm not well-versed on the gender balance of homelessness, but it has to tie in with barriers to mental health care for men (feelings are for weak females), a male-dominated military and therefore a male-dominated veteran pool, as well as the decreased social acceptance of LGBQ men and transwomen. 
The hazardous work conditions and death on the job-Traditionally male jobs are more hazardous- warfare, construction, welding, etc. If women were represented equally in these professions, we would probably see that statistic even out. I don't know your background, but as a woman in the US, I was told repeatedly that the high-risk job I was interested in was only for men. Ex: While at a professional workshop, I met a young woman in college who wanted to be a game warden. Two male game wardens were behind me later and were talking to one another about her. They couldn't fathom why a young, attractive woman would even be mildly interested in being a game warden, let alone have it as a specific career goal. Ex: and the reverse:Male nurses. Why do male nurses get ridiculed for their chosen path? Because it's viewed as a woman's profession, and therefore inherently less valuable and rigorous.
Custody- This is something society absolutely needs to work on. I think the custody issue is two-pronged. In ""traditional"" western society, men were not involved in child-rearing. It's women's work. So, many people who are in charge of granting custody are socially conditioned to think that automatically the mother would be a better custodial parent. And THEN there's the whole women are meant to make babies thing. I grew up in a subculture that very vocally valued men over women. A woman's highest calling was motherhood. Women do not lead, they should only work if they are absolutely forced to, etc. Western culture is generally accepting of stay-at-home mothers, but ridicules stay-at-home dads. Why? Because they're perceived as ""not man enough"" because the woman in the relationship (assuming a cis-hetero couple for simplicity's sake) supports the family. 

**Feminism isn't just about getting women the same rights as men. It's also about getting rid of the idea that there is shame and weakness in womanhood and  ""womanly"" things.**

I mean, FFS, when someone is scared to do something, people call them a pussy. They mean that the person is weak, afraid, pathetic, and incapable. And pussy means vagina. So then, vaginas (and those who wield them) are similarly weak, afraid, pathetic, and incapable. 

*There's a really nice video that I can't find right now that talks about this. If I can find it and remember this convo at the same time, I'll post it for you.

I will call tomorrow to ask for the general cost but I think I will wait for my second appointment first before I actually go there.

&gt;If you do have ADHD, this limited testing won't help you because you don't believe it 

I see myself in too many things here and it explains so much... I think I would need further testing to ""accept"" a no and not the other way around (although it would definitely help). 

In a way I went there for confirmation and not really ready to accept a no which is why I doubt myself and how I answer the questionnaire.","fge6rmb",1,1580692654,"2020-02-03 01:17:34"

"3576","I know how you feel. Kind words from people who don't understand the relentless internal battle we have with ourselves are meaningless.  

The realisation I've come to, somewhat ironically, is that the only person I can truly rely on for the kind of support I need, is myself... 

I wouldn't call my situation a ""success story"", maybe more limited-high-functioning. 

I'm working in a high stress environment in a job that's not particularly suited to the ADHD brain, and despite this I'm managing to kick a few goals. In my spare time I'm building my own house. A project which has taken 18 months so far. I think it's pure stubbornness that keeps me driving forward on it. And through all this I'm managing to stay reasonably fit, exercising somewhat regularly. 

It ain't fuckin easy though. You need to be realistic about how much you can handle. I've all but completely stopped drinking. I bought a motorbike which has truly kept me sane, and has the bonus of being a great way to get out to parties etc when i need a little social top-up (""can't drink, on the bike"").

ADHD breeds resilience. Even with all this control and effort into achieving the best level of consciousness I can, there are still shit days. For absolutely no reason I will wake up and know that no amount of medication will make me into a productive human being that day. You know what I do on those depressed days? I remind myself that it's ok to feel like that, and tomorrow will be better. And I'm almost always right.

Whilst I'm working my way through this exhausting experience that is the ADHD life, I'm also thinking. I'm thinking about what my ideal life would be. What environment do I want to create for myself? And how can I do it? And I gradually start working towards that life. That's what keeps me going.

Maybe this gives you some hope that things can get better. I don't strive for happiness anymore, to me it's a futile endeavour. However, I do find myself content with life more often than I ever have before, and that works for me. ","dp8g7bg",1,1509622756,"2017-11-02 11:39:16"

I try very hard to simply take my time when I'm upset and consciously talk myself out of or through something, but I fail in the moment.

Taken from http://eponis.tumblr.com/post/132405222265/in-praise-of-coping: 
&gt; Let’s hear it for coping mechanisms: the last, desperate attempt of our bodies and minds to survive despite everything. Let’s hear it for deflecting and denying genuine emotion.  Like calluses on bare feet, it protected us when life made us walk on sharp gravel instead of soft grasses.

&gt; Let’s hear it for the numbing oblivion of addictions to games, alcohol, or self-harm.  Like a welcome wave of anesthetic, they quieted a pain too staggering to bear alone. Let’s hear it for frantic perfectionism.  Like the hunger of a rumbling belly, it goaded our behavior to earn the only validation that we could find.

&gt; When we had nothing else to rely upon, our bodies and minds rose to the challenge of protecting us.  So even as we work to shed those coping mechanisms, because we know the long-term harm they cause, let’s say goodbye with love and gratitude. Let’s hear it for coping mechanisms, because they cared for us at a time when no one else could.","df79ckn",4,1490063670,"2017-03-21 02:34:30"

I really like reading but is has always been a struggle for me, also when there are many steps involved and someone is explaining something  to me I tend to get lost.

When someone is trying to explain something to me Verbally I would prefer it to be as clear as possible( I usually can’t get hints and some social cues witch makes me feel embarrassed and self conscious) if needed analogies are welcomed and if I can ask questions all the better. I am pretty curious and love to learn new things, but it my working memory and attention are awful.

If it is something written the best would be to have everything sorted and in an orderly fashion, I study law and while some books are awesome and the people who write them make them more engaging and understandable without losing technical aspects, other authors write in such a way that they take ages to get to the point and it becomes painful to read.

When it comes to studying I fidget a lot, take a break from my cellphone(except for my reminders) and use studying methods to help me,  I also have a fidget toy, it helps me as well, and of course my meds.

As to what you said about images, I feel you, for me it’s way easier to read manga than other books(despite that I enjoy them as well) and I just remembered that my Japanese(her parents are are Japanese and she visits Japan often, also she is a native speaker)teacher told me and my class that in Japan the education ministry published the hole history of japan in colaboration with famous mangaka(manga artists) and the results where various volumes of History Manga( its awesome for learning).

Sorry, this might be too long and I must have missed the point,the thing is that I learn better when there is some sort of reward as I progress, the subject itself is interesting to me, the person explaining it to me is patient( I know it can be hard, but depending on the thing it might take me a lot of time to learn and one can become sensitive to negative feedback), If it can be conected with something I’ve learned on the past,also challenging and novel things.

"3634","I think it is great that you let them know that you're feeling grumpy and it isn't their fault -- that way, they learn that they can also express their feelings when they are feeling upset, and that they don't have to hide them from everyone else. That is a lesson I never learned.

Also, I think a lot was lost from us moving to nuclear families that often live great distances from extended family. People are raised by one or two other humans who aren't perfect. So I will tell you now -- the best and most important thing is loving them, and teaching them that they are always worthy, and that while their actions may sometimes be negative, it never changes that they are a worthy person, and their actions can always change for the better if they notice the problem and ask for help. 

I am not a parent, so I can't give advice on that front -- but if you have the resources, desire, and time, you might try seeking a therapist, and even letting your kids know that you are doing so, depending on how old they are. I imagine something like, ""You know, kiddos... I've been grumpy a lot, lately, haven't I?"" (Their answer to this can already give you some information -- and if you do this when you are feeling softer, less angry, you can take this as a chance to hug them, and tell them how much you love them, so that they're seeing that love outside of the context of you being grumpy, as well. It's okay if it makes you cry, or something like that -- they can't be held responsible for comforting you, you have to do that for yourself, but you can let them know how strongly you feel as long as you remain in control of validating yourself.) And then you can say something like ""You know what, Mommy is going to get some help -- sometimes when we're feeling grumpy all the time, or sad all the time, it helps to ask an adult to help us out. Isn't that right? Even adults sometimes have to do this!"" (Again, depending on their age, adjust appropriately.)

Or you can take that moment instead to just give them something they love -- a treat, or time with you, or playing a game. Find a moment when you do feel ready and okay, and spend it with them, and enjoy it with them, if you have any moments like that.

Another thing that comes to mind is -- how angry are you at yourself? Have you forgiven yourself? If you're carrying a bunch of resentment towards yourself for failing, it is bound to make it harder for you to be relaxed and open when they're acting out. Instead, you'll be less than perfect, and then that inner voice will go, ""Man, you're screwing up your kids for life, you know, you're just like [adult who didn't treat you as well as they could have]..."" That's not going to make you better at responding, it is going to make you upset and even more guarded and withdrawn.

You will not do a perfect job. I guarantee there are ways your parenting will fall short, just like every parent in the entire world falls a little short at least in one area. Your job is to raise adults who feel loved and who can love themselves, and who will then take responsibility for developing those areas that you weren't perfect in. That's part of being an adult -- rounding ourselves out, because no two people in the world can do a perfect job.

---

**tl;dr** -- AKA, the slightly shorter recap.

*I am not a parent*, so I have no idea how hard it is for you. So take these suggestions with a grain of salt -- these are just ideas that came to me, and I hope they'll be of help!:

1. Forgive yourself, truly and deeply, as an ongoing process that might not ever get done, but is essential -- feeling bad about yourself does not help your parenting, it hurts it. At least, that is my guess from knowing a bit about the impact of shame on any other activities.
2. Get help if you need to, and take this as an opportunity to show your kids that you can ask for help from others without shame -- it will help teach them that they can do the same if they get older, and it will help teach them that they can be open about their struggles with people who love them.
3. If you have a moment where you feel like you can manage it, try getting their feedback on if you've been grumpy a lot, and then apologize and show how much you love them with a family game, or a fun night, or letting them each pick a day where they pick what you have from dinner (from a menu, if necessary). Soften into any feelings of guilt you have, and remember -- your behavior wasn't perfect, but your behavior can change. Feeling bad about behavior changes behavior. Feeling bad about yourself -- it just drives you farther away.
4. Another idea that occurred to me -- what about a game that helps them help you when you are at your limits? Like you're feeling overwhelmed with how rambunctious they are -- what if you channel that into, ""Okay, let's play statue! Have you ever played statue before?"" And you explain to them that the idea of statue is that they have to be super still and not make a noise (within what is reasonable for their age). Then you play gremlin, and make funny faces to make them giggle and laugh. Or if you were feeling mad, you can storm around and pretend to be a monster looking for little kids to nibble on, but you can't see them because of how still they are being. ""Where'd they go!? I'm sooooooo hungry!"" -- whipping your head around if any of them start to wiggle or move like you noticed them all of a sudden. This gives you a chance to act out your anger in an over-dramatized way that actually is a game with them (and that can avoid cuing them into how genuinely frustrated you are). On the first round, if one of them is not playing along well -- no worries, you play eat them, play eat any other siblings, and then the last one left standing gets a fun-size candy! That will motivate the rest of them :) Of course, your lenience will have to be adjusted a bit depending on their age so the older ones don't always win!","d5u23fs",3,1469681527,"2016-07-28 04:52:07"

"3652","I've struggled hard with this. If it helps, this is actually relatively normal. It's just that, like everything else ADHD related, we feel it to a greater extent that ends up negatively affecting our lives. But there are some things that can help.

**TL;DR in bold**

**The normal part of it is called ""the honeymoon stage,"" and even neurotypicals are not exempt.** It typically lasts anywhere from a few weeks to 18 months.

It happens because your brain pumps you full of those 'happy' and 'bonding' chemicals like dopamine and oxytocin. **So you *literally* can't see the person's flaws as clearly, because you're basically high af.**

**But, like any good thing, your body can't sustain that,** and the novelty to help sustain it wears off. Then all those little things your brain was ignoring come rushing in and you're wondering why you ever went out with this person in the first place.

**The problem for us ADHDers is that this gets taken to another level.**

- We're more likely to dive into a relationship head first, and miss taking the time (*before* the chemicals turn you brain into soup) to evaluate whether this is actually a good match.

- Like someone else said, we like shiny things, so what we end up going for in a relationship/person isn't actually what we *wanted* to be looking for.

- Our brains tend to lack/incorrectly regulate those same chemicals you get from a new relationship. So the drop from them is harder for us.

- We're more likely to go looking for that chemical boost again in another new relationship. But for us this can also become a dangerous cycle that's....basically addiction.

**Some things that have helped me deal with this.**

- Realizing/coming to terms with that **a lot of those feelings aren't supposed to last** and that's okay! Those aren't what will sustain a relationship.

- Really thinking about what my ""non-negotiables"" are, making a list, and evaluating every potential date by that list (i.e. kids, finances, lifestyle, etc).

- Same list as above but for reg flags that signal this won't be a good relationship

- Having a trusted friend help you look out for red flags and other things you might not notice

- And the one that led to my most recent, and healthiest, relationship (two years and still going).... Try dating people that you're interested in/attracted to, that meet several of your non-negotiables, but that **don't** make you initially want to fall crazy head-over-heels for. **Basically go for a person you like, but don't feel hyperfocused on.**

These, and the same ADHD strategies we use for everything else, can help 'build the pause' so we can actually take a minute to evaluate ourselves and the relationship - instead of diving in and coming to the surface months later wondering how we ended up here *again.*","gist63o",4,1610313113,"2021-01-10 21:11:53"

My experience is that no one knows me better than I do. I have insights they’ll never have and can trust myself. They can make educated guesses at best. ","dphysgu",1,1510098076,"2017-11-07 23:41:16"

"3663","Haha that stream of consciousness shifting is something I do often,  I end up writing about something completely unrelated to what I intended to!  

Yeah the motivation parts are actually the biggest hurdle I find with this.   I am self employed and so I HAVE to be self motivated,  but I can't motivate myself.   I make a good employee because I love receiving praise,  but I don't value it from myself or even my husband.  Of COURSE he'll say ""wow that's great!"" to anything I draw.  It is not motivating.   And I can't create external rewards,  I can't tell myself ""If I finish this I can watch TV!""   Because deep down I know that there's nothing *really* stopping me from watching tv right now other than a vague sense that maybe I can't pay the bills next month if I don't work.  And as you say,  that consequence is not immediate or real enough to motivate me.   If you were standing beside me saying ""I will punch you in the face right now if you don't draw"",  I would draw.     If I tell myself ""You can buy yourself that thing on Amazon if you draw"",  that doesn't motivate me,  because I can impulsively just pull out my credit card and buy it now anyways,  who cares if I can't pay the bill later because I'm not working :P   Self sabotaging brains are the worst.   It sucks because I am still a rational person and I can totally see what is happening and that it's a Bad Thing,  but I can't seem to make myself care.   It's always ""Oh yeah,  I need to get right on that.  For sure,  tomorrow!""

Re:  The adderall,  I know it's still early,  I wanted to make sure it wasn't some big red flag.   My doctor told me to keep raising it until the side effects were too bad.  I am not really sure if what I experienced today is a bad side effect,  or just my body getting used to this dose etc.   People who have been on the drug for years can probably say if these things happen from time to time,  if it's normal,  if it's just a thing that can happen or if it is a sign that my dose is too high,  or if it's not at all a sign and just a weird day.   

Once I realized that I needed physical exercise and that I was going crazy just sitting still,  the day went much better.  I was able to do things I've been putting off like some cleaning and weeding,  I was quite motivated for that,  it's just not the RIGHT thing I needed to be working on today!    If I had a deadline I'd be highly stressed right now at the lost day,  but as it is I can just shrug it off.

I didnt really touch mountain bike again until almost 8 years later when I moved back here and decided to start racing. So yeah, only here and in seattle and a couple of trails in virginia once when I went to visit some friends.

How about you? Do you still ride?

Again, I'm so so sorry to have taken so long to reply, hope you're doing great.","dminu3s",1,1504466252,"2017-09-03 19:17:32"

"3698","&gt; The sheer fact that you assume I have no idea what capitulating means, shows that you naturally look down on other people, thinking greatly of yourself.

&gt;&gt; i.e. starting to study then getting distracted, or becoming overwhelmed easily and feel like giving up?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, stop staring into the void. The more you stare into it, the more you feel like capitulating. So stop that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If this was so easy, do you think I'd be taking medicine in the first place? While we're at it, let's totally disregard that this was a question about ADHD.

Really? Because I'm pretty sure it's just you that I'm looking down on for not recognizing that what you said is the definition of capitulation.  

&gt; No, you probably don't give a shit.

You're smarter than you sound. 

&gt; I'm certainly not bored, as I have always found my classes interesting but extremely challenging, largely due to my condition. 

So then up your dosage and stop complaining. If it's not ADHD related, then upping the dosage won't do anything. If it is, then problem solved. 

&gt; Using your ideas, it seems that you struggled with being unmotivated or with a lack of interest in material.

No, I persevered and it was terrible. I realized that it wasn't a lack of interest or motivation but a chemical imbalance. So I did something about it. I also realized that ADHD doesn't exist in a vacuum and that the stressors in your life influence it. If you take your meds and you find yourself still being distracted, the either up the dosage or the meds aren't what's causing it. ","d69913t",1,1470677502,"2016-08-08 17:31:42"

An empty box is a waste no matter how big it is, and makes you feel like a waste, too.

"3746","Late to respond, but I came across your post when I was searching on this subreddit.

I'm 25M and have ADD. I'm Dutch too, but for the sake of helping other people that find this thread too, I'll write this comment in English.

First of all, the sympthoms you describe are very typical for people with ADHD. I completely understand you tho, I have often experienced the same feelings and sometimes I still do.
 
For people like us it can be easy to put the blame on ourselves. Partly because many people don't really know what ADHD is. Partly because we have lived with these problems all our lives. This can make ADHD a very invisable disorder for everybody, including ourselves.

Luckily lots of my friends are diagnosed with AD(H)D too or/and are at least very understanding. Still, not everybody understands what ADHD is. Many people still only know the old fashioned stereotype of young boys that are jumping, running and screaming all the time. But ADHD is much more than that. So, a big part of the problem is often people being misinformed or naive.

What really helped me, is getting to know ADHD. And with that, getting to know myself. I did this by doing a lot of research only and by connecting to ADHD communties, including this very subreddit :). 

I always like to recommend [this video](https://youtu.be/ouZrZa5pLXk) to people who would like to know more about ADHD. It's kinda long, but it gives an amazinf decription about ADHD. I would recommend you to show it to some of your loved ones too, including your boyfriend, so they can somewhat understand what ADHD really is and what you're dealing with.

You should also give the YouTube channel [HowToADHD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nPM1_kSZf91ZGkcgy_95Q) by Jessica McGabe a try.

"3755","Just realized this ended up being a much longer reply than intended lol. TL;DR - had very similar experience, talked to my doctor about my concerns and negative side effects and found the correct dosage and balance for me. Helped out tremendously!!! 

I had a very similar experience with my adderall medication. I was officially diagnosed and treated with ADHD when I was 22. I went to my family doctor that has taken good care of me throughout my life. (Just recently retired unfortunately). But when I say “family doctor” I mean he was the primary care for all my immediate family since before I was born...my grandmother was very close to him and his wife. Anyway, at 22 I made an appointment with him and expressed my problems of not being able to focus or sit still or accomplish any sort of task whether big or small and how badly it was affecting my career and life. He told me my mother turned down treatment for adhd when he had mentioned it to her when I was a child. He prescribed me 30mg extended release adderall 1 time a day. After my first dose I realized how much of an improvement it made within just the first few hours. Unfortunately....throughout the day I noticed that I literally felt like I took that one pill from the movie limitless. It was crazy. I kind of assumed all the negative side effects would level out once I had taken it for a month or so. But it never did and I literally went from being 170lbs to 120 lbs within about 2 months. I didn’t sleep and I didn’t eat. At all. And it was miserable. Although the side effects were terrible, I was, for the first time in my life, accomplishing things and actually being able to put to use my potential. And I was afraid of losing the progress I had made in my career and at home. But after a year on the medication I just couldn’t handle the sleep deprivation and malnutrition anymore. It was doing more harm than good. So I went back to my doctor and just explained that the adderall has really helped me mentally, but it was doing more damage to me physically. So after talking about it, we tried a different dosage of 10mg immediate release twice a day. And let me tell you what, I finally feel I have a great balance on my life since then. Been taking that dose for 3 years now and I am so happy I switched. I hope you are able to reach out and that your doctor will be able to help you with what works best and is healthiest for you mentally and physically!","eykdams",1,1567145953,"2019-08-30 06:19:13"

I feel like what I’m doing is helping but I don’t know if he sees something different. 

In our discussion he stated that he knows she’s one of the smartest kids out there and that she’s a good kid. That’s why he doesn’t understand why she can’t do regular tasks without having to be reminded and that she does them slow.

"3759","I don't know about your doctor, but my doctor refused to mix formulations of amphetamine (e.g. extended release Dexedrine with instant release Adderall) which I honestly find a bit self serving as adderall is 50% dexedrine. anyway my point is, Vyvanse doesn't have an instant release version and never will. If your doctor is an informed one, he/she will know that dexedrine is the closest equivalent.  Vyvanse breaks down into dex in your blood, although technically it is lisdexamfetamine. With what you've said I would try (ideally) a dosage schedule of a dexedrine IR in the morning, followed by your Vyvanse in time to prevent the dex crash, followed by an IR 4 hours later. Basically, if you just take the Vyvanse first and then IR to ""get you through"" you might experience what I call the brain bouncy ball effect, where you wear and stress out your brain by launching then crashing with each IR pill.  having the extended release in the middle helps maintain a baseline that prevents your poor brain from bouncing so hard. When I was on just IR this effect made me feel terrible in the long term so its worth avoiding.","c469ll9",1,1333033713,"2012-03-29 15:08:33"

"3772","The exact same thing happened to me with my last job - it was a great job as I was the boss of my team, I got paid well, it was easy and within my abilities, and the support system was amazing. 

After three months of perfect attendance aside from a couple of colds (I worked at a childcare) my health and motivation fell to the wayside, I couldn’t maintain my life at home, and everything kept falling apart. I became depressed and anxious. I took so much time off because of a back injury, chest infection, as well as feeling unhappy about working and then it snowballing into shitty sleep and guilt over it all. Finally quit after a year of working there because I’d had been absent for a combined total of about four months.

This was how I found out I had ADHD. Good job, me.

I think it happens to all of us. The only ways to combat this is to have a job that you thoroughly enjoy and keeps you on your toes, and I suppose having a good grip on work/life balance.","f3z2p1n",1,1571262153,"2019-10-16 21:42:33"
"3773","I would probably guess that the tiredness has more to do with depression than ADHD then. Although, obviously, the two are related. Getting to the gym (or finding a sport you enjoy) would definitely help, even if lack of exercise isn't the root cause. But you know this so I won't keep on about it. I know how difficult it can be to break a vicious cycle.

Is there a reason for your depression or is it just a general low mood? If there's a root cause for it then that can give you something to work through but unfortunately most of the time it's just a case of putting one foot in front of the other until you get to the other side of it. You do get there though. Get back to exercise when you can, other than that the only advice I can think of is drink more coffee and avoid sugar.

"3800","Same experience for me. Was diagnosed just over two years ago, been taking Vyvanse since, and I still find certain aspects of my emotions/feelings hard to deal with. This is particularly true as it relates to how my wife and I have gotten along since a shift in my behavior requires a shift in hers.


I don’t know about you, but for me emotions before treatment seemed to require too much effort to focus on. I would normally say something like “I just need to process my feelings,” but it was because my mind was already on something else. Nowadays I’m assertive about how I feel, which can be alarming (for both myself and others around me). I’ve had to find a balance between being blunt and being passive in interacting with others. 


And like you described, there are times when the emotion or anxiety I have exists not because it’s warranted but because I have more clarity now on the precursors to those feelings. Like, I’m quicker to recognize my own faults now that I’ve been diagnosed and treated, so I‘ll jump to negative feelings and anxiety prematurely. Where someone else might worry they’ll get fired from their job after multiple screwups, I start worrying sooner because I don’t want to screw up if I can help it (and before my diagnosis I often couldn’t help it).


I recently downloaded a mood tracking app to help me get a clear look at my emotions. Maybe it’ll help keep me from falling into some of the mental traps I’m prone to. It’s called Moodnotes if you’re interested. ","dt1kbnh",1,1516589595,"2018-01-22 02:53:15"

We are currently working with an ADHD center for treatment and so far they have only diagnosed her with ADHD, although I suspect she has some anxiety or compulsive issues as well. 

The destructive tendencies only happen at home. She will chew on clothes at school, but never has destroyed classroom property or anything like that. We did have her in soccer and dance classes. After awhile, she asked to switch to music lessons, so I bought her one of those exercise rebounders to get her wiggles out after school. 

We do try to keep a pretty strict schedule after school where she has a checklist of things she needs to do every day, like writing practice, music lesson work, cleaning up her room, etc. If she gets everything done without too much struggle or fuss then she gets an immediate reward. Sometimes she’s all about completing her checklist and other days it’s a losing battle. It’s pretty exhausting, I’m not going to lie.

"3834","In reference to a small portion of your post - your child's christmas party. 

I think it's great that you acknowledge your child's struggles and are aiming to reduce frustration! Especially since forcing your kid to read when he's frustrated, bored, confused, etc. will likely influence his attitude towards learning and school. So, I think it might be beneficial for you and your child to play devil's advocate about going to the Christmas party. 

Your child might benefit from the Christmas party. When reading is a challenge, it's likely your child will develop a negative attitude (haha I just spelled that as additude, thx additude mag) towards reading. A negative attitude can be enough of a reason for a child to check out and essentially avoid learning a lot of really important foundational concepts. 

Think about taking this as an opportunity to read in the presence of all his other classmates enjoying their story time and help him enjoy reading and feel confident about it. You can do this by using ""Dialogic Reading"" where you really break down the story line and engage your child in the story.  Ask questions about each page, the pictures, what they think may happen, what just happened, etc. This way your child feels more ""in charge"" of the story, less like a passive (and often confused or bored) listener. Check out [this](http://www.readingrockets.org/article/dialogic-reading-effective-way-read-preschoolers) article to read about easy ways to make reading more enjoyable and less boring for you and your child. Research shows dialogic reading is really effective in benefiting children both academically and emotionally.

Finding out that your parent took you out of school because reading with everyone would be boring might have some pretty negative repercussions in the future. Your child might feel special and thankful to you, which is great, but not when it's because he's getting to avoid school work because it feels laborious. Rewarding poor attitudes towards school and letting your child see your thoughts about his teachers is not good. (Not saying you do this intentionally, this just might be an unintentional side effect of your attempting to protect your child). Or, your child might feel bad that he didn't get to go to the party, feeling like he's not smart enough to read. Your child might hear a ""tone"" in your teachers voice regarding him not attending the reading party. Remember, people with adhd are emotionally reactive and have a tendency to be self-deprecating. 

If you went, you could ""model"" for your kids' teachers that he really is able to do everything that his classmates can, but maybe just in a different way. There have been a lot of studies about how a teacher's attitude about a student is correlated with their performance, regardless of their IQ. So, showing the teachers your son's capability could help them treat him more appropriately. In addition, it might help with the condescension issue you're having.

On another note, does your school have an SLP onsite or a resource center? Having some one-on-one time with an adult who's in tune to his needs may be good for your child. It can also help focus him on some things that he may not be focusing on in class because he's engaged in something else. 

Another couple tips that may be helpful - tell your son's teachers that he needs transition warnings so that he can have time to adjust and wrap up what he's doing. Have them tell him: ""In 3 minutes we're going to do this/clean up/etc"". Then, ""okay, it's almost time to wrap up. Three more turns.""

I'd suspect that your son's teachers are interacting with him pretty negatively when he's ""acting out"". His needs aren't being met, and he's being punished for something he doesn't understand. Try talking to the teacher's about having a positive reinforcement ""sticker chart"" or something. You can provide the chart and the stickers, and when your child is acting well, he get's a sticker. Each day (it can be each week if it's too much of a hassle, but it won't be nearly as effective if it's every week due to the nature of ADHD), his chart is sent home and you talk to him about what happened if there are stickers missing, and talk about how he felt and why his teacher interpreted it as bad. Then ask him to tell you how he earned all of the stickers he did get, even on days where he didn't earn them all. He can relive his ""positive behavior"" and it will help him be more conscientious of it. (Kids with ADHD tend to act out ""on accident"" a lot. They're not aware they're acting out.) 

It's important, for this to work, that he is successful with getting the stickers. Especially in the beginning. The teacher needs to ""catch"" him acting well, so he gets that reinforcement. 


Your teachers may not be willing to do this, but if they are having as much difficulty with him in the classroom as his report card states, this could save them a lot of hassle and headaches.

Message me if you're interested in any of these ideas and I could elaborate further or help you with how to approach the teachers, give you some of my own behavior management charts, etc. It might take me a while as I'm quite a busy individual, but I'm definitely willing to help in anyway possible. 

Best of luck.

"3837","Yes! It’s called task initiation and it’s one of the executive dysfunctions that comes along with ADHD. It’s one of my worst executive skills in fact, even with medication (I’m supposed to be working remote right now). 

Sometimes paring a not so fun task with a fun task helps, like listening to a podcast while cleaning your room. Other times bargaining with yourself, like I’ll start my homework and if it’s terrible in 15 minutes I can stop again, is helpful as well. Usually when you start something it’s never as bad as you think it is! 

Having the terminology was helpful for me, if you google task initiation there are lots of tips for getting started. Good luck ✨🤞🏻","f1n7lia",1,1569610812,"2019-09-27 19:00:12"
"3838","Someone else mentioned that maybe the 'comedown' from the stimulants is exacerbating his irritability? If it helps at school, but he is getting worse later in the day, that may be the case. I don't know anything about ODD or tourette so I'm speaking from a super limited point of view, but I know that the comedown from my meds is pretty brutal. I've read that guanfacine (which can be used standalone to treat ADHD in children) has also been found to be effective in treating irritability and adverse symptoms from the stimulant comedowns in the evenings.

&amp;#x200B;

I've found that getting some exercise can REALLY help elevate my mood in the evening. Beyond that, I really try to avoid interaction or anything too brainpower-reliant for a couple hours because I feel so spent. I'm super outgoing and I will snap at my girlfriend or completely zone out of the conversation when my meds are wearing off.

Is exercise an option at all? The best combo for me is always to get some exercise, do a couple easy chores like laundry, and then some solid alone time listening to music and painting (usually paired with a beer as a treat, but you could try a kid-friendly 'treat' during alone time too). If you could finagle some exercise-then-alone-time for him, this would also give his brother some 'safe time' to eat dinner in peace, maybe.

"3848","Oh man, I can totally relate. I find it so easy to forget what I'm doing as soon as I start- the app I've found most helpful (and I've tried a LOT) is called Random Timer. 

I set a regular timer for the amount of time I want to do the task, and then start Random Timer which continuously goes off at random intervals in the range I set (sometimes as low as 30sec to a minute) to remind me that I was doing a task and should refocus. 

Don't have to look at my phone (it automatically starts again) and if I find I'm consistently on task when it beeps then I bump up the upper limit a little. 

Best thing is that it means I can tell how well I'm actually focusing and adjust it as I need to and the more I practice, the longer I can focus for (like, a whole 5min! :O ) and the beep becomes associated in my head with refocusing and being pleased with myself that I've managed to stay on track.

Do do this within set blocks of time though, it's much better to do it really well for short periods of time so your brain learns the behaviour rather than getting bored and half-assing it.","d9kuujv",5,1478222009,"2016-11-04 01:13:29"

It was always a thing between us. But now that I considered ADHD in my life, everything starts falling into place. No one ever thought ADHD was a possibility. In fact, it wasn't before I researched it to help my son that I learnt that women show different signs that men. So I think perhaps it's too much for him to process... his behaviour is horrible, but I didn't marry a horrible man, if you know what I mean.

I also think divorce is the last thing when everything else fails. You don't just dissolve a marriage of 14 years; there are 2 children, a house, 2 cats, the life as we know it would be destroyed.

In the meantime, I highly suggest taking a short nap sometime after work (no more than 30 mins). You can read online about the benefits of napping, and I've found them to be necessary while on Adderall. After work, I set a 25 min alarm and nap. During that time my body starts to wind down from the day and begins to relax in the quiet time. It's like meditating. I use that time to let my mind wander and think about what I'm going to do when I get up from my nap. Oftentimes, I focus on my breathing to help reduce my anxiety and give my brain and body the oxygen it needs. When the alarm goes off, I feel way more calm with more energy than I did before. When I don't nap, I've noticed my evenings are more painful and draining. I don't know what it is about those 25 minutes, but the benefits continue to motivate me to maintain the habit.","gw5arw2",2,1619593724,"2021-04-28 07:08:44"

If you have a bunch of things available but have no idea which one is ""right to do"", my solution is to flip a coin/roll a die/generate a random number to decide.

Now the secret to this is that you need to pay attention to how you feel when the result is revealed. Are you satisfied with what random chance has chosen? Go with it. Are you disappointed in that result? If your brain says ""it should have been 'X'"", do 'X'. If it's just disappointed that it chose 'Y', flip again with one less option. 

You're not bound by the coinflip, because the coin has no arms and cannot force its will upon you. Do what you have now discovered you are actually wanting to do.

"3912","""It's a blessing and a curse""

I think I'm at the start of that path. My life's way too messy, and has been for a long time, such that my new, medicated appetite for order is subtly burning away...

So I try to ""barista"" it, to steadily tidy things as I encounter things and deal with things. (New appointments get put clearly, tidily in the diary in ways I'll know to look for then, birthdays I've known of for decades but never remember do not - trying to recover everything I've forgotten about is a few lifetimes' work!).

I find it very stressful, but *trying* to be pragmatic about perfecting what I can usefully organise (a short to-do list, a schedule for THIS morning's urgent stuff), and viewing the other stuff as ""optimal (for me, now)"" takes the edge off.

I think it's also easy to see this as an on-ramp for OCD - but I'm ignorant of a lot of it, and happy to think that so long as the organising impulse remains a well-wrestled strength, then it's the OC-part, and not the disorder.

I.e. It's just an impulse, a desire, a... Personality trait.

ADHD is still what it always was, but this obsessive can be more like finding that your arm is very strong - you need to practice some delicacy, and be aware of when you can't be delicate (so's not to pick up fine expensive objects d'art!).

It's still a hassle, but shackling it a little (rather than deny it entirely, or giving in to it entirely) is a way to manage it.

Then again, this might be VERY easy for me to say - I'm definitely not a perfectionist.

But the more comfortable I am with, say, sending an email out without editing and rewriting it a dozen times (perfecting innucous one liners!? Jeez!) , and relying on my colleagues to ""know what I mean"" (or to be encouraged to tell me if I'm unclear and they need the edits!) helps a lot.","gin1w8c",1,1610182238,"2021-01-09 08:50:38"
"3913","&gt;I was under the impression that ADHD got better with age.

HUGE misconception my dude. 

ADHD APPEARS to get better with age because the person normally develops various coping strategies to effectively work around their deficits. 

You're only 15?  You haven't had the opportunity to really grow in to it yet.  Now is the time to strike while the iron is hot and concentrate on developing HEALTHY and EFFECTIVE strategies to cope with life in general (and I strongly emphasize the healthy bit.  I've spent much of my life covering up insecurities instead of fixing them, and now I'm nearing forty and my life is just falling to pieces faster than I can put it back together.)

If you feel like your symptoms are getting worse, talk to your doctor about it.  Maybe you need an adjustment in medication or a different medication strategy altogether.  Maybe you could look in to some Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I've heard a lot of good things. 

Basically, You're 15.  If all goes well you've got like a solid 60-80 years ahead of you, and at least 3 more years before life  *actually* starts kicking you in the nuts every hour on the hour just to remind you you're different.

"3919","We feel the neurodiversity movement is harmful to people with ADHD. While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

Words like 'neurodiverse', 'neurodivergent', and 'neurotypical' are political terms coined by the neurodiversity movement and are inextricably tied to it. They are not general-purpose medical or scientific terms. Please use 'people with(out) ADHD' or 'people with(out) mental disorders' instead.

"3926","Everyone here is bashing the doctor but that’s just the doctors view and it still could be valid in ways. She could have a reason for what she says. First of all a lot of good doctors won’t actually diagnose something, maybe unless they have to to prescribe a drug. They do this because a lot of the time things are misdiagnosed and and it’s better to just treat the underlying problems than putting a label on things. The other reason is that once a person is diagnosed it makes it easier for them to use the diagnoses as an excuse, again just treating the underlying problems can be more beneficial. 

Also there can be benefits in school to being labeled or not labeled. In some instances like school it’s better to be labeled as just having attention problems rather than having ADHD because the schools can put you in special Ed and take you out of normal classes. It’s a bunch of games when you get into these systems. 

And , to be honest, even if that wasn’t the case I like looking at things from that view myself. Most of the time I treat adhd like it is fake and they use it to sell more drugs. Some of that is probably true to a degree anyway. I don’t completely disregard it, but I keep an open mind to both sides, thinking it’s real and thinking it’s not. It gives me a way better balance to how I control my life and I started making way more progress. 

So while maybe you should get some second opinions, i wouldn’t totally disregard this doctors opinion. Some doctors just suck, even ones who are going to tell you you have it.","gi3j1o2",-1,1609788273,"2021-01-04 19:24:33"

It makes me think back to all of the psychs who were so eager to diagnose depression, when those instances were always initially triggered by being overwhelmed due to ADHD. (Not to say that I wasn’t depressed, just the the depression followed from being so unable to cope with an event stressor that I let get out of hand) I wish the standard psychiatrist was more in touch with ADHD symptoms in women.

It’s okay to be lonely, and to struggle, and to be tired of struggling- but just not ALL the time. Sounds like you’re on a roller coaster and just wishing for a moment of stability to rest.

I don’t have any answers. 

But, in my experience (being female) my hormones either changed over time- or I hit 19-ish and I got irritated more often. I eventually realized it correlated with a certain time in my cycle. Years later I got on a hormonal birth control that has made as much difference as any of my other medications (ADHD, Depression meds). It calmed me down, made me less anxious, and less irritated. 

Your words reminded me of that time before I got the hormonal birth control. (Not saying that will help, but it just reminded me, so I figured I’d share.)

Also, don’t underestimate the stress you’re under. “An appropriate response to an inappropriate level of bullsh**”- or however the phrase goes. If you’re dealing with a lot, you have to respond accordingly, and that’s not wrong. A lot of social etiquette will break down for anyone in pain. So if that means you need to disappear on weekends, and cry in a blanket fort with ice cream and plushies- then that is exactly what you should do!

"3952","Your guilt and frustration is not allowing you to focus on what you need to do. You need to get past that. Is there something you can do that would give you an easy win? and not video games, I mean a satisfactory and life improving goal that you can achieve that will make you feel good and like a success. Even if it's finishing a paper early or surviving a class. Physical activities like P90x3 (which is only 30 minutes a day) may also be a good choice too. Exercise is good for ADD and we all need to work out more, no?

I'd also recommend the pomodoro technique. 25 minutes of work and you forgive yourself at the end of that 25 minutes and try again for another 25 minutes. Some days you will do a bunch of pomodoros and you will have fought with yourself the entire time. Some days you'll get in the zone. The key is that each one is a chance to try anew and not sit wallowing in self pity at the misery of your existence.

What tools are you using for planning? I've found that if you can get everything that you need to do down and are not holding it all in your head, there is more room in your brain to focus on the slog through studying. Try using Trello for school (like put down every single assignment from your syllabus into a column) and bullet journal for personal life. I literally put stupid simple things like ""shave your armpits"" or ""what's the name of that dude in that xfiles episode with the lightning dude?"" in my journal. It's out of my head and that's all that matters. 

Most importantly, what friends are you accountable to in school? You are putting all your motivation on you and you need to offload it to other people. Do you have a GOOD (no slackers) crew of people you can study and work with? Who are cool and good students in your program? WORK WITH THEM. Be accountable to them!

Undergrad - wasn't on meds, excelled, was confident, outspoken, happiest days for me etc. 

Grad - on meds, anxious, self-conscious, not confident, feel dumb and severely unmotivated.

Despite all the institutional barriers and society being designed for boring brains, I think the real big difference for me has been the lack of stimulating subject matter. 

My point is, you probably need a new job - one that is fulfilling, one that stimulates your thinking and motivates you to be productive. 

I know this has definitely been the case for me - when I'm in a good place (i.e. where the conditions complement my ADHD) I am the happiest.

"3970","Well, I orgasm every time I have sex, let alone masturbate. So I'm probably not the wisest girl on this topic.

But my advice would be to keep trying.  Keep refocusing your brain. Have you read any steamy romance novels?  Sometimes porn can look really gross and painful for the women in them, so they might not be a turn on for you.  Try reading romance novels, and keep redirecting your brain back to sex.  Notice whenever you come across something that particularly turns you on and focus on that.

My gyno told me my ability to cum super easily probably has to do with the location of my clit, so I think largely it's just biological.  Stop putting pressure on yourself that you ""need to orgasm"" and just enjoy- notice what turns you on and what doesnt.  Some women can only come with vibrators, so you should look into buying one.

I had a harder time getting my O when I was a teenager.  But, as with all things- practice makes perfect.  Make masturbating a priority- try to do it a few times a week, and really enjoy the time.  

You may not be able to ever orgasm, but it's worth a shot.  Getting control of your orgasms is seriously the most amazing, and empowering thing.  And it feels sooooo much better than just getting turned on without that release.

Good luck!","cu2aomw",2,1439515952,"2015-08-14 01:32:32"

"3975","First of all, you're not alone here. In my case, I had some a a lot of expectations heaped on me when I was growing up, and once the ADHD really kicked in, there was no way I could live up to that. So the disappointment turned to guilt, and then shame, and then an overwhelming fear of even trying to do things, because why bother if you already know that you can't do it properly? It's a paralysis of perfectionism. I'm not sure it was the same as depression for me, because I always had the feeling that tomorrow I would do better. There was that little nugget of hope that stopped me collapsing into a heap. 

So I'm 42 now (diagnosed with ADHD at 36) and decided to get professional help, because my strategy sucks! Just started a few weeks ago. I have to write down at least three positive things every day, either things that made me happy or pleased in some way, or little achievements. If I'm really struggling to think of three things, and I usually struggle to think of one, I can write ""was on time for work"" or ""ate normal and healthy food"" (I just recovered from an eating disorder so this counts for me). It really has to start so small, and I look at the list and I'm embarrassed by how pathetic these little things are. Then I realise that's coming from the ""voice"" I'm trying to get out of my head.

So the next step is to analyse the list and look for positive traits. Simple statements beginning with ""I am capable of..."". I am capable of being punctual, etc. Then you analyse the list of traits and make more abstract statements. So it becomes ""I am capable of organising and planning my activities"".

In the sessions, we talk about all kinds of things, and if I ever say anything negative, my therapist will point at the empty chair she placed further away, and I have to go and sit on the chair and repeat what I just said, then come back again. So it's been four weeks, and it's not so difficult to think of positive things, and I didn't have to sit in the ""naughty"" chair at all last time. Mostly, I still think negatively, but I am getting better at not saying anything out loud. 

So it's cheating in a way, but that's the idea. There's a really big wall in my head that I built up over a very long time, to protect my vulnerability, and it's going to take a while to knock it down, so we're just going to keep hacking away at it with whatever simple tools we can find, until it eventually just collapses. I'm still sceptical, but I wasted enough time (and enough life) already, so it's worth a try.

I don't know your specific case, beyond what you wrote, so I hope what I wrote was somehow informative, even if it wasn't totally helpful.","cf67ch1",1,1391462305,"2014-02-03 21:18:25"

3. Know that the state of mind he has is a lot like doubt, can you think of a time you were full of doubt doing 100's of things? Restless? Except imagine each of those things is an arrow hitting the heart, each failure is more evidence of his failure (to him).
4. Don't blame *him*, but notice when he's blaming himself, see if you can comfort him with an ""It's ok"" kind of mind, not self blame, not self praise.

Yes i went to a psychologist  and she said i dont have adhd because in age 7, 8 9  dont know which age exactly i wrote all of my school notes again on a new paper cuz i had this perfectionist inside of me with this task to color my school notes etc and jt gave me completion inside of me . I have ocd probably also since young age but i heard it coexist wirh adhd .. also my skin picking disorder since age 6 also gives a hint that i have ocd (also had over 10 years intrusive ocd thoughts that are not anymore present since 3 years)

She just said a kid with adhd couldnt focus on such a task and write all scool notes in a nice way on a new paper ..  i said to her well ocd can coexist . Or hyperconcentratioj and she just blocked off .. that made me depressed last year cuz i really thought i have adhd .. 
And i still do .

What do u think about it?

"4014","I’m not a doctor, so I don’t know if that’s “withdrawals”. From personal experience I’m usually a little more tired off medications (was not true as a kid or for most of my teen years). But I also have Depression, and that can make me feel tired, like stay in bed for 18 hours and sleep for 12 hours a day tired. But that’s another story.

Does he have experience off his meds, and if so- is this somewhat normal for him? 

I was off meds in the summers growing up because I struggle to swallow pills, so I kinda got to see myself growing up with and without ADHD symptoms getting in the way. The brain fog didn’t get better with time, but I learned ways to deal with that. The problem of tiredness is relatively recent- started noticing it in college- sometimes even on meds. I noticed a lot of people (not necessarily ADHD people) getting into coffee during those years. 

I know off my meds, everything takes more mental energy, and if I push myself too far I will get a headache (this has been true since I was little). The headache will go away when I rest, and stop trying to focus or concentrate. 

I’ve been kn adderall XR, and I’m on Concerta now. (Well, back on Concerta- is more accurate). Concerta was the best fit for me- but then insurance stopped covering it, so I tried different medications and doses over the years. I’ll say, while adderrall xr certainly worked, I experienced side-effects and I describe it like: When it starts working, you know, “it hits you like a truck”, and when it fades in the evening it staggers down or can drop you a little hard- in my experience. That was how it was for me, not necessarily everyone. 

By comparison, Concerta was more subtle, fades in and fades out. When I first tried it on the lowest dose, it was harder to tell when it started working and how much it was working. The next dose up, I could feel, but it still seemed more subtle- I liked that, not overcompensating and it felt more natural to me. 

So- I don’t know how serious his symptoms are- because what you’ve described sounds like the average Saturday to me. I might not be understanding well enough.","g2qaaa1",1,1598301571,"2020-08-24 20:39:31"

"4022","I am unmedicated by choice.  It has nothing to do with fear of side effects or evil psychiatrists.  However, I am a recovering addict (opiates, alcohol), and I don't handle medications on my own.  When I do need to take any substance with abuse potential due to medical need, I have to have my significant other dole them out according to the scrip.  Even though I believe I could handle a stimulant without abusing it, I'd learned enough about self-remediation without feeling an overwhelming need to seek medication.

Much of what we have to do is learn our limits and live within them.  For example, I never sit anywhere that I can't make an escape from if at all possible -- the aisle seat in a theater, the back of a classroom, etc., if I get bored or fidgety.  I've learned to lead a rich internal life, fueled by higher education (I teach college), so if I'm trapped I can think about what I want.  It also helps that I'm older and I've just had time to figure out a lot of this stuff.

FYI, I am 61 and female, scattered and a hypertalker with a tendency to hyperfocus on things I love (like creating jewelry).  I once spent 16 straight hours playing a videogame.  My talking parakeet learned to make all of Qbert's sounds from that game that summer.  (I was off from teaching high school.)  I was 47 when I was properly diagnosed (ironically I diagnosed myself then got my psychiatrist's confirmation, who said, ""I was wondering when you would figure it out."").

I used to dominate conversations, interrupt people speaking, all that.  I've learned that people are completely repelled by that and there is so much power in learning to listen.  What others say is actually more interesting than my own ramblings even though I'm a natural storyteller and have a lot of them from my travels, but asking them their opinions or experience is key.  Doing that results in a lot more to keep my attention than if I were just blathering on.  As a teacher, I have to listen to my students if I am to be worth a damn anyway.  They bring a wealth of experience and backgrounds to my classroom, so I ask questions and listen carefully to their answers.

I keep one of those monthly planners with me, and I meet most of my deadlines with few problems.  Time management is hard, but most stuff gets done.  My house is a disaster sometimes, as organizational skills are awful, so I pay a good friend to help me clean.  It's worth the money.

Get rid of the distractions in your work space as much as possible.  I cannot work at home if there is a TV program on I want to view.  The internet is hard because my students submit all their work online, and I also take two graduate classes online.  Yes, I surf.  But I set deadlines there and somehow manage.

That's a bit of rambling there for you.  Hope there's something in there that might help.  Learn as much about yourself as you can and make the adjustments that you can control.

Good luck to you.","d9xw94k",3,1479001702,"2016-11-13 01:48:22"

"4057","I take 40mg, it gets rid of most of my anxiety -- I can still feel normal levels of anxiety about things that it makes sense to feel anxiety about , it just helps with my irrational anxieties. That might be a bit high of a dose if you feel that way -- you can open up the capsule and dump a tiny bit out into the trash, close it back up and take it to see if that helps. If it does, you might just need to go down a dosage. (Just make sure you do this on a day you don't have many commitments or obligations because you might feel tired/not as productive if you dump out a little too much)

I like Vyvanse, but I have to get regular exercise in order to keep a healthy sleep schedule. That's the biggest thing -- when I first started on it, I accidentally got into a sleep deprivation cycle because I wasn't getting enough hours of good quality sleep and then I would forget, because the meds help you feel more awake. Not good, definitely keep an eye on that, it can lead to some not-great and scary side effects. 

Otherwise, make sure you eat even though it sucks -- I do lots of protein shakes or high-calorie shakes if I can't stomach solid food at lunch or breakfast. Eating also helps the meds work better.

Those are the only two side effects I get - sleep interference and appetite suppression, but both are really easy to manage.  ","db0suv9",2,1481380643,"2016-12-10 14:37:23"

Most normal people can't relate to that. 

Your best chance is to find a job that's fulfilling and not completely brainless. Don't go for easy jobs like retail or call centers. I got my start by being a non-union laborer for a commercial construction company for a couple summers, then got promoted to non-union commercial carpenter (framer). We did everything from demo, to framing, drywall, and ceiling grid. After a few years of that I moved up to an assistant job superintendent and was running some small jobs, then moved companies to get an office job with that experience and now I'm a manager. 

The construction trades are a good place to get a start like me. I'd avoid plumbing or electrical unless you want to do that the rest of your life, but getting into construction management by putting a few years in as a grunt on the ground is better than any degree.","fbaiqq9",1,1576679241,"2019-12-18 14:27:21"

Because there have been times where I was either unwell , depressed or really busy and I'd be quiet on group chat for a time. Suddenly no one's talking on group chat anymore at all and people are not interacting with eachother anymore at all.

I've always seen myself as the shy one, the socially awkward one. But as I got older and examined my role in my groups of friends I have realized I appear to often play the role of the glue. And if it wasnt for my ramblings and middle man messing between groups that these people wouldn't even hang out with eachother anymore if I disappeared. And that even if they're too busy to reply, reading a long rambling message from a friend you've not seen in months is still nice for them even if it's slightly eye rolling. It'd be missed if those messages stopped appearing , and friendships would fade. 

So I feel less guilty these days if I do the odd ramble and don't even get a reply. As I know I've read the odd ramble and smiled from other friends but been too busy to reply.

Studying at the library to me means giving up on studying. Deleting distracting applications to me means not using my phone or computer at all. Increasing accountability to other people means never admitting to anyone I would like to do something and abandoning any thoughts of starting to do something, also trying to stay away from people who I talked to about this accountability issue as well.

"4149","I've told so many counselors how I feel like making friends is a waste of my time. I gotta say I still feel the same, honestly. I've just tried making so many friends and in one way or another I have always been let down by them. Then I'm terrified to go back to them and reconcile somehow. Interestingly, if I run into peers at university or old friends at the store, I hear very kind things and get shown how people actually do like me! :p I have a big family so I try and at least just keep up with them every so often and they're family so we love each other no matter how long it's been lol. 

I was talking to my husband the other day about my memory. Ever since we got married two years ago, I have no clue when my wedding anniversary is. I'm lucky if I guess the month correctly. I can recall the most mundane facts, like how I was taught specifically how to clean glass in a university cafeteria job, but I can't remember the day I met my husband or our wedding. It sucks but I'm glad he's so understanding. At any given moment he will ask me ""so what did you eat for lunch?"" And I honestly don't know. Or the famous ""what did you do today?"" He literally has to walk me through my day for me to try and remember. He's like ""okay so you woke up...and then...?"" Lmao it has to be step by step. Luckily I enjoyed writing notes in classes so that was okay, but student disability office allowed me to record lectures and that was great as well. Not a game changer, but I had peace of mind if I had a panic attack in class or something, then I could go back and listen. 

Honestly I had to use Xanax to allow me to do exposure therapy and this is what I feel Adderall is doing for me. Xanax allowed me to ride in a car with my husband and not feel like I was going to die. I actually enjoyed myself. Then after so many months of doing this then I didn't need Xanax just to get in a car. Similarly, Adderall shows me what amazing ideas I have in my brain and how organized I truly can be. And this gives me hope because even in my first month of treatment I have confidence that I can do important things and I'm seeing the proof in front of my eyes.

You said you’ve been taking medication recently, and if you’re noticing these feelings ever since taking your meds then you probably need to re-visit your prescription. I know how you feel, and it totally sucks. I think you might be experiencing some major dissociation/depersonalization—and I think it’s high time those symptoms be introduced into the larger part of ADHD dialogue. If you haven’t heard of them, I would strongly recommend doing some research on dissociation and depersonalization. In my experience, it’s very comforting to hear that there’s a word for such strange feelings.

"4158","Here! Did great in high school, I was actually one of the top two or three highest-scoring students - probably because everything was quite interactive.  Then in the lecture-based system of uni I just completely bombed out.  The material was never in-depth enough to hold my attention and when I swapped to a major I had no prior knowledge whatsoever of to combat that, I ended up finding I simply didn't have time... It felt like you're learning a hundred first steps, you know?  And I'd get impatient for the next step but then I'd need to go onto a first step of something else. I flunked out of college three times and this was my experience in each major.


I think age, discipline and meds would have helped a lot, but at the time I had no idea I was ADHD (only started suspecting a few years ago and diagnosed this year).


I ended up completely skipping the bachelor's and am now part-way through a master's and doing pretty well! I actually ended up helping a few people write their Ph.D. theses as part of my work a few years back and realised that the depth involved made it easier to focus - and I'm really enjoying the master's.

"4184","Power nap. It's not really a nap, more like a brain reset. Dark room, eye mask, get cozy, whatever you do when you're going to bed. Once you're settled in, set a timer for 20 min. If it helps you, listen to white noise/rain/guided mediation. Go into it 100% like you're going to go to deep sleep. Let your body relax and your mind wander unfocused. 

Probably won't work if you struggle with racing thoughts or insomnia, but if you can get into that drowsy pre-sleep stage that's good enough.  The key is when the timer goes off, even if you feel like you could totally stay in bed and sleep, sweet sweet sleeeeep... DON'T! Get up immediately! Drink a glass of cold water! You may feel drowsy for 5 min or so but then you'll feel awake. For me at least, I will feel totally wide awake and alert for at least an hour or more afterwards. It's like tricking your brain into starting the WAKE UP ignition sequence for an extra boost. 

It works for me, sometimes on my break at work I go to this one quiet room we have with a couch and pull my hood over my head and snooze out for 15-20min. It always gives me an extra boost for the second half of my shift.","f8r27x6",1,1574730130,"2019-11-26 01:02:10"

There was a lot of things my mom wrote to my grandma like ""he has trouble focusing at school"" or ""his teachers all say he's very smart, but doesn't apply himself"".  This was in grade school and I remember always this frustration of being held back or held down by something I didn't understand and it all kind of makes sense now.

"4189","You and I have a similar problem. At least in a certain context. You're measuring your timeline by other peoples. That is unfair to you. Other people don't have the same life experience as you. Nor you other people.

 Don't look at other people the same age as you and get frustrated with yourself. It's not doing you any good. It took me till I was about 24 to figure that out(I'm 26 now).   And a HUGE outcome on your success is your positivity. Look into positive psychology. But seriously...stop comparing! Instead figure out what you want and how to get there.  Then do what you have to.

Lastly I've worked with a lot of people that worked in a shitty job they hated because they were too afraid of finishing school and getting a real job they *might* hate. Don't be them. Else you're more likely than not resigning yourself to a crummy job you might like that won't pay well. It's not always the case.......but it is more often than not.


Tl;Dr don't compare yourself to the success of others. Your life isn't a sprint or a marathon. It's you, running a time trial over and over. The only times that matter are the ones that you out up on the board. 


P.s. it is OK to see things that other people achieve and strive for them. My buddy finished pharmacy school and him not being dirt poor like the rest of us has been a huge motivating factor to finish school. That being said, he is him, and I'm me. So he's making 6 figures, and I am 26 still in school. And he's younger than I am. And it doesn't mean jack shit. Because I'll work hard and see success too. Just not in the same way.

Currently having being able to actually get up and ready in the morning unless I take my meds first thing, but I'm working on fixing that. 

I am taking a multivitamin everyday with my other meds though, and I've been trying to keep more quick-to-prep, healthy, and ""desirable"" foods on hand.

And honestly, I've noticed the same with my overall diet. But it's also just easy for me to go a whole day and not eat ~1000 calories, so I'm just trying to get some good food systems in place so that doesn't become the norm.

On that note, I forgot about omad! That sounds like a good resource for this.

Last question: do you have any exercise tips? What are your approaches to working out? I want to get to the gym more often, but I don't know what exercises/routines I should be doing or if I'm doing the proper form and struggle with staying motivated.

"4194","What a powerful reach-out. Any reader can feel the pain you clearly are in. So let me share my thoughts, and you can have a read and see if there is anything useful in the things I think you should know, in no particular order:

1. Firstly, you are not powerless. You can change things in your life. Not all at once, perhaps, but in little steps over time. You can create a rich and happy life.
2. I know this because you have already taken the hardest step, which is the first. Actually, you have taken two steps already: you have posted on Reddit. More courageously, you have scheduled an appointment with your GP. 
3. An ADHD diagnosis may be part of a thorough evaluation, but it isn't as important as making sure you get a thorough overall assessment of your physical and mental health.  A sleep disorder, for example, can totally mess up your life. So can depression, an unprocessed childhood trauma, a messed up gut biome or a myriad of other things. So don't ask your doctor for a specific diagnosis. Share any and all symptoms with him that you have noticed that might point to a physical or mental illness.
4. While you are waiting to see you doctor, or possibly a specialist further down the line, try to be attentive to the positive messages the world around you is sending you about your future. Rumination, self-loathing and fear are bad advisers for your future. They hide your talents, the positive things and opportunities around you, the subtle beckonings, the positive vibrations when a person, an activity or a context resonate with you.  
Good Luck!
5. PS: a less subtle sign from the universe comes from me: one obvious talent is your expressiveness. You told a huge story in few words. You clearly aren't stupid. And a person who has tried 15 jobs must be resourceful and have some perseverance. No doubt there is more.","g9ieuum",4,1603254571,"2020-10-21 04:29:31"

Like I said, just try and give it more thought, till it becomes habit. Like, maybe set up your phone to remind you to shift up a certain amount of time after you leave home or work (by which time you're usually on the highway). That way, if you're on the highway in 10 minutes after you leave home, you'll be reminded to upshift either right before entering the highway or a minute or two after being on the highway.

Medication helps me more and when it wears off, it's completely gone.

"4258","Actually what works best for me is putting time fixed appointments in my phone‘s calendar and not writing anything else down.

I learned to trust my subconsciousness to remember important stuff and my improvisation skills to fix everything I messed up.

Also I like „physical reminders“. I.e. I spread my bills on my dining table. The more it spreads the more I‘m reminded to pay them.

I know it sounds a bit stupid, but I just thought, it doesn’t make sense to try doing something that doesn’t work anyways. I tried to figure out how I managed to get this far in my life without ever having had planning methods that worked. And I realised, it’s because very often I remember stuff just in time, sometimes a bit late but with my improvisation skills I usually still manage to get it done.

Now, that I‘m not obsessed with having to plan everything and write it down, I can relax more often and sometimes get stuff actually done.

I still make lists sometimes, but usually they are more for sorting my thoughts or stuff like shopping lists.","ghqx4jv",2,1609528100,"2021-01-01 19:08:20"

What I find helps when first getting into this method, is that even if random bullshit comes into your head, that focusing on your body as well as trying to focus on MULTIPLE parts of your body at the same time really helps.

Like if I'm focusing on one part, and I start to wander off, I try and keep all of the parts I've relaxed in my mind, and hold on to the awareness and relaxation in each as I go. It takes up a lot of my attention span, because while doing one body part and moving on is okay, doing one body part and then increasing your area of attention and holding on to the body part you moved from is a lot harder!

Yes my fiancé is fully aware. She is actually the one who brought it to my attention.  I grew up in the time where everyone was getting diagnosed with ADHD left and right and my parents fell on the side of feeling like it was over diagnosed (which it may have been) and therefore I didn't have it, so I kind of grew up with that mindset myself including the same feeling about depression as well. Always thought to myself if I could just get to this point, or get into this career, or do this or that that things would get better and I could manage, or maybe I really was just careless or lazy.

But after being with my fiancé she really brought everything to light for me, in a kind way.  My best friend and roommate for several years is also probably undiagnosed ADHD as well as my other best friend, so this type of behavior to me I thought it was normal because everyone close to me was like that too.  So me and my fiancé moved in together and I realize that it's not so normal, she's been a great observer and great in helping me understand and try and manage operation and tried to be organized. But it's got to the point where further steps probably need to happen.","d4ecs77",2,1466263934,"2016-06-18 15:32:14"

I think i stopped lying these white lies because basically you replace shame with shame. You may hide that you forgot to do x or simply procrastinated on y, but instead of avoiding shame you create new shame through lying.

I realised that lies actually create more shame (as you also have to hide the fact that you lied on top of what you lied about).

"4351","I am actually doing exactly that right now. Funny enough, about 2 hours ago I was lying on the couch and fell asleep, slept for an hour or so and got up to turn off the PC. Instead I just checked Reddit and Youtube for ""five minutes"" and now I'm still here. It's 2 am, I am tired, but I would have to get ready for bed and that's hard.

It's usually a combination of three things why I avoid going to bed: Firstly, the steps required to go to bed overwhelm me. This really depends on how good of a day I'm having, sometimes just changing feels like an impossible task, and my brain gets overwhelmed. I just keep thinking ""I should go to sleep"", and then my brain goes into panic mode, complaining that I would have to get up and then undress and then go to the bathroom and then brush my teeth and then wash my face and then maybe have a glass of water because of course I didn't drink enough today, again, and I have a dry mouth, and then I have to actually go to bed but I also have to find my phone and charge it... You know the drill.

Secondly, there's hyperfocusing on something, going down some internet rabbit hole. Or I just wanna finish reading that one article or watch that one video, but then autoplay queues up something even more interesting and when I look at the time again it's 5 am and I don't know how that happened. This one is annoying, because sometimes I feel like I'm physically stuck in place when I'm in fact not.

Thirdly, there's the fact that it's incredibly hard for me to fall asleep. I just... keep lying awake for the longest time, because my brain won't shut up. Knowing this, it leads me to putting off actually going to sleep for quite a while sometimes, to the point where I wait until I'm so tired I really can't stay up anymore. It's really not healthy.

So yeah, I can relate. A lot. This is a huge problem and I don't really know how to fix it.","dxbw0t1",10,1523665464,"2018-04-14 00:24:24"

I wish there was a way to be forced to get outside and do exercise. I think it's a key to turning the switch in the brain. Only problem is the starting. Forcing oneself  is an off and on success.  I'd prefer if there were a fitness wellness officer that came to your house armed, and would threaten you to within an inch of your life if you didn't do it. (I see an idea for a business here, perhaps you can take that and run with it?)

Water therapy, as in swimming,soaking in hot water, cold shower ,sauna ,steam bath, etc I think are also good helps. As does fun like throw a frisbee or beach ball or climb a tree.  As does being in some nature, even a backyard or small park or garden.

The thing that helped me is just coming to terms with the fact that everyone bitches about everyone, even the people they really like. If you simply accept that people can and will talk about you behind your back life becomes a bit easier.

"4381","Hey :) you have literally posted my exact feelings today! I even had a word with a family member trying to explain this exactly, but felt bad because I don’t want to blame everyone else. Although serious blame does lie with people just watching me spiral multiple times and not helping proactively! I haven’t been diagnosed with ADHD I have BPD, but I’m pretty sure I have ADHD I’m waiting for a re diagnosis meeting after the lockdown to see what it is. I’m 25 F, and feel like a total flop in life. I keep comparing myself to people I went to school with seeing how well they’re doing and I still feel how I felt when I was 15! 
For as long as I can remember I keep telling myself I will change tomorrow or today or on my birthday, New Years, Christmas etc etc then just feel like I go up and down and all around but at the end of the day still feel my same old crappy underachieving self. I don’t have an answer for you I’m looking for the answer myself. I guess if I were to give advice it would be to work with yourself... so the parts you want to change notice who you are and what you’re like and be honest... face the great things and the less positive aspects of yourself and rather than hate them think ‘ok, so that’s what I’m like right now,’ and accept it. 
Keep in mind you’re aiming to change. But that you don’t have to right now. Then start working with who you are right now. So if you were to find a way around certain behaviours, or almost ‘trick’ yourself how would you do it. What advice would you give to me for example if I had that certain behaviour you want to change, or that certain feeling. If you can accept who you are, with change in mind as an active thought but not a pressure, and can find ways to work around yourself or with yourself or even trick yourself then eventually change happens without you realising. 
And by ‘trick’ I mean, say you’re trying to get a baby to eat some veggies and you mush them up and mix it with their favourite pasta or something... idk if that helps and I certainly need to take my own advice. It is easier said than done but celebrate the small changes because it’s a series of small changes that will begin building a more solid foundation.

"4393","First, this is a really good post. The only issue I can see is that you already have external accountability in the form of clients, and already struggle to keep commitments and deadlines with them. I'm not saying these ideas are destined to fail... they are great ideas! But you have to ask yourself, what commitments *do* you keep and how do they differ from the ones you *don't* keep?

Something I don't see mentioned in this suggestion is sleep. If you have to pick one thing that would positively affect all other things start with sleep. Before exercise, before external accountability. Lack of sleep affects how your meds work, your work performance, and your ability to implement and stick with a schedule. Commit to a regular bedtime. It doesn't sound like your all-nighters result in much actual work completed anyway. 

Think of it like this: If your business relied on trucks to deliver goods, it would be bad business to run those vehicles into the ground and not maintain them. In your business, YOU are the vehicle. Sleep is basic human maintenance. Exercise is a close second, and maybe you will choose to implement them together, but the sleep part *has* to happen. 

As an aside, I see posts from many ADHD folks that don't do well working at home. If you start building better habits, get your meds adjusted, and find you're still struggling, you could try looking into a shared office or co-working space. If your brain can associate your office space with getting work done your productivity might improve.","cvctbam",3,1443117933,"2015-09-24 18:05:33"

"4402","It's a tough question, like the cold hard truth is that you're right. I haven't been able to fully hit my potential at 34. My folks have a masters and phd respectively, I barely escaped with my bachelors. I'm a programmer now, and I'm happy and lucky to have a middle-class job, but I can see that I'm better at this than a lot of others and that I'm not where I could have been if my true potential was unlocked. 

What you're saying is valid, but at the same time I wouldn't dwell and get down in the dumps. It's like Cheetarah from Thundercats says 'You are only trapped when you stop trying.'

There are ways to trick your mind into letting you unlock more of your potential. I think it's different for all of us on how to achieve that. You're going to have to find your path, I'm working on finding mine still.

Now that you've recognized this tough reality, don't let people coddle you into denying it. You can feel good about this when you see yourself putting in the work to do something about it, regardless of short-term results. 

Doing self work is bulletproof, it cannot be denied by any self doubt that you are doing the work. You'll feel you are great once you feel you've given life your true best, it's not about the results but the effort.

Remember, we have a (oft-unrecognized) disability and others do not. We know it but they do not, but it is there. It's super important to not try to compete with anyone but yourself. Push yourself for you.

"4409","I feel the same way. I love my medication because it makes me feel like a real person. Not 100&amp;#37; sure, but I like to think that it has something to do mentioned a lot with eastern philosophies that use meditation. 

With ADD, you are constantly thinking about something. Whether it be overthinking something in the past or future, or daydreaming about a hypothetical situation that will never happen. Anxiety is also a frequent symptom of ADD, and for me it's usually thinking about the future. 

Philosophies like Buddhism practice daily meditation so that they can connect mind and body, and be present in the moment. If you've ever had a moment where you were incredibly present in the moment with no thoughts, at least for me, that's the most human I have ever felt.

On medication, being able to control that focus to limit your thoughts comes more natural. You aren't overthinking about some future event or past mistake. When you do an activity, you're much more aware that you're doing it. Without medication, you're constantly in your head with thoughts that really do not pertain to the present moment. There's no connection to mind and body. Time flies by and you have no idea what you've done except just think about random stuff. When you aren't always in your head with thoughts and anxieties, there is more mental room to enjoy the moment, feel your emotions, and to clear your head and listen to the musical and how it makes you feel.

This is kind of vague and somewhat hard to explain, but I hope this makes some sense to you. If it doesn't make sense, then just know I understand exactly how you feel :P","e24w6l4",20,1531240333,"2018-07-10 16:32:13"

**If an individual's behaviour benefits the group as a whole, but is detrimental to the individual, the individual's DNA can still be passed on to successive generations. If they saved the lives of their close relatives (that have very similar DNA to themselves) then they have caused that DNA to be passed on to successive generations even though they themselves do not have offspring**

This is a complex subject and it's not as straightforward as a lot of evolution is. In fact, I believe even Darwin couldn't answer why this happens in Origin of the Species - in those days nobody knew about DNA.

Basically it's possible for traits to be passed on even if the person doesn't have ancestors.

If you think about a bee colony or an ant colony. You have a lot of sterile workers who assist the queen for the benefit of the hive but do not have offspring themselves. This is for the benefit of the colony but in many circumstances the individual will die to aid the colony.","dgzdzyg",5,1493642691,"2017-05-01 12:44:51"

 Other than that, I basically have an ongoing internal dialogue that doesn't shut up wishing vyvanse which can make me feel irritated and frustrated with myself.

I also HIGHLY doubt the amount of prolactin secreted is large enough or a long-enough period of release to ""waste"" a dose of medication. 

Besides, that also assumes that an ADHD-type brain even has normal patterns there, which is iffy. If the whole dopamine and neurotransmitter system is weird, which it is, especially RE reward/stimulus, I'd be very surprised if something like that was as explicitly true or clearcut.

Besides, a million things increase prolactin. Stress. Being a father. (But I repeat myself ;)) High-protein meals. Seizures. Exercise. 

If your meds are less effective after indulging in your ""bad habits"", I suspect that's either placebo, or your habits are substances. Alcohol doesn't counteract adderall, it just has affects that are opposite adderall, and are usually more noticeable.

While there are waivers for certain things it is extremely rare if not impossible to get one if you have ADHD. It's basically a liability for the military that they're not going to want to deal with, even in a draft situation.

The zync is an important part of proper brain function because it is used in neurotransmissions (aka thinking) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7082716

Fish oil (DHA) has also been shown to be crucial for brain function. It lack of DHA in old people is linked to mental decline and in children it is linked to a number of things including... ADHD http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661899904954

Now you may actually have enough of all of these things to not need to supplement but a lot of our diets are actually deficient in this stuff.

To be honest I was always dubious like some of the people in this thread until I started supplementing and felt a difference. Placebo effect is certainly a real phenomena but it can only account for so much.

Write down what you need to do. Keep a notebook with you all the times. Make your tasks visible to you. Post its, note cards, dry erase, etc. If you don’t see your tasks, they don’t exist. 

Don’t put stuff off if you can help it. Try to get in the habit of doing things right then and there, or you’ll have a thousand shitty little things you haven’t done, you won’t know where to start and you just won’t do any of them. 

Put your phone in a drawer, on silent or off. My phone is my worst enemy at work. 

Try reducing your caffeine intake a little bit. Caffeine could be making you feel worse. 

Know that you are worthy of your job and capable of doing it. Fight for your job. You worked hard to get it. 

Get some counseling or therapy. I know how you feel and it’s awful to feel that way, but you are going to be okay.

"4513","I see a lot of comments here but I'm not sure any of them really address the core issue I see. It's true that your husband's *very* poorly-managed ADHD is causing these problems, but this a problem with two levels. The ""symptom"" level is the behavior you're describing here. Almost all of what you've described will absolutely be caused or exacerbated by ADHD or comorbid issues like anxiety.

But the root issue is that at some point, your husband transferred the burden of managing his ADHD onto you, and that is *not* where that burden belongs. Look up the term ""emotional labor."" You may want a box of tissues handy. (I sure did.)

You deserve better. I don't know if he can give you that. If you wish to try, then I find in you're best off starting by changing your own behavior because right now that dude is burrowed in like a tick. I'm going to throw Harriet Lerner's ""The Dance of Intimacy"" on your booklist. Find a counselor, preferably someone in an evidence-based therapy practice like CBT/DBT or ACT and is ADHD-friendly, but for *yourself*. (I stress the importance of making sure the counselor understands ADHD well because they're going to be able to validate your emotions without dismissing the genuine impact ADHD has here.) Assess whether your behavior is in any way enabling his bullshit and if so, why that is and how to fix it. Then do that. This will almost certainly illicit a dramatic reaction of some kind, good and/or bad. That will set you up to make the best choice for your future (and your family's future) possible.

So out of frustration I was doing research on how I could self discipline better, and I’ve noticed that If i’m not on medication that If I do something in a bite sized manner that I’ll be more successful at it for instance 5m meditation every other day instead of 30m meditation everyday. I also learned that even if I miss a day I shouldn’t give up and just continue on. I do notice that I can’t really maintain it for a long period of time though so it’s usually like a come and go thing but as long as im doing it once every month it makes me slightly prouder of myself.

"4566","Side effects are different for every person, my experience with it was a bit of a mess at first, but you honestly do adjust and I have zero side-effects now. It's not uncommon to get headaches and a loss of appetite and dry-mouth (which lead to taking a leak every 30 minutes for me). The medication also exacerbated my already-poor sleeping habits, and made it even more difficult for me to sleep. 

It's important you build good habits like regular sleep (seriously sleep can have a significant effect on focus and subsequently the effectiveness of your medication) and maintain that whilst on medication. The side-effects gradually went away, yet it's important you do things like eat healthy and exercise in order to lessen their impact and make it easier to gauge whether the medication is really messing with you, or if it's simply having a worse effect because you barely slept the night before.

Your doctor will work out all of this business with you and will change your dosage according to how badly the side-effects are on you vs. how effective the medication is. Don't rush it and try higher dosages sporadically, it's never a good way to gauge how effective the dosage is for you. You may even switch medications if one isn't working out.

In regards to your question about the GP, I'm not so sure there are even GPs that specialize in ADHD. I just saw my one, asked for a referral to a psychiatrist who I already looked up that specialized in ADHD and went with them. If you're having difficulty, try and get an evaluation from a psychologist first and pass that along to your GP/referred psychiatrist to give more concrete evidence. That was my plan after running into difficulties with a shitty psychiatrist, but turns out the referral letter didn't even make it to my new one but it made no difference cause he is pretty great and not uneducated.

Also, you need to get a referral from a GP to see a psychiatrist. I'm almost positive you cannot book an appointment with a psychiatrist without a referral beforehand, plus it helps you as well. 

The treatment without a doubt has changed my life for the better. It's the best fucking thing that's ever happened to me, and it honestly feels like I can start my life how I want to now. For the first few months after I got diagnosed and prescribed meds I made the mistake of not understanding how the medication works. I thought it'd be something like *you take the pill, now you can do that essay*, but there's a significant amount of organisational dysfunction that you have to undo in order to actually do that. In my idiocy, I banked too much on the meds as a means of treating me, and subsequently fucked around with dosages too much which made the side-effects worse (coupled with my already bad lifestyle habits). The meds are a tool to fixing those habits, they won't magically fix everything, you still have to do all the work, it's just easier now :). Don't rely on them, rely on yourself, and you'll have much less to worry about.

I recommend you do see a psychologist who specializes in ADHD after you receive a diagnosis to coach you in what to expect and how to approach your life without all the ego clouding your perception like mine was. I didn't do that unfortunately, but I know if I did it would've saved me a lot of time and stress.

Im newly diagnosed last year, good psych who helped me titrate meds every few weeks. So i kept a really good record, plus i have a period tracker. 

I had gone up a dose and it was way way too much, so I went down again. But i still had the higher dose meds at home. 

One month I was particularly premenstrual- i get physical symptoms but more noticeably a kind of hopelessness mentally. Everything feels dramatically sad. And because of tracking mood more I remembered a vague article i had read about female hormones so i took the higher dose that day. 

It worked! I didn't have the ""nope"" that i had had when i first tried the higher dose. It felt normal! 

I was pretty excited to tell psych and requested a variable script. And no. She was not comfortable giving me a regular script and a ""period"" dose. I still have enough of the higher dose to have one or two for the next six months when I remember my mood is from the hormones. 

And i look forward to some more research being done and drs listening to women who really do know what is happening!

"4577","Absolutely, I think a lack of sleep exaggerates all my symptoms.  Another thing that seems to make it worse for me, is that time of the month.  Since I have been off of meds, I have tried to take note of my symptoms and what effects me differently.  Of course a problem we can run into, is sleep escaping us.  Again, I have only been able to take a little bit of control since stopping meds. Now I am on a pretty good schedule of being in bed by 9, sometimes as early as 8. I have to get up at 3:45am for work so I am usually ready for sleep.  On nights where I am more wound up, I'll take melantonin or even z-quill.   But I do still have to fight my cravings for McDonald's during the day at work. 9 times out of 10, if I get the thought of McDonald's, or whatever, I will be leaving work at lunch to go to the bank for $10 so I can get food.

"4578","Still working on correct dosage here. I had asked my doc to write a scrip for methylphenidate (ritalin), because Consumer Reports said that it was the best buy and has been around the longest... Seems kind of silly now to get one's medical advice from Consumer Reports.

I started with Vyvanse (expensive) and am now using generic Adderall IR, which is just as cheap as methylphenidate. My doc didn't want to prescribe methylphenidate. After reading people's posts online, I'm glad he didn't. It seems like more people have problems with it than the other meds, but it depends on the person.

As far as parents, I'm similar in age as you. I've decided so far not to tell them. I don't want to answer their questions yet and don't want to listen to their opinions on it. I don't think they are ADHD-deniers, but at this point, I'm still finding out what works. Nine times out of ten, when I tell them about a problem, they want to give me advice about things they don't really know about. It's just in their nature.

On the other hand, my wife is happy with whatever might help me make more money. She has her own mental health issues. But she's also seen me hyperfocus and later lose interest on things over and over. On the one hand, she's seen the evidence. On the other, she can be dismissive for that same reason. So I don't go into too much detail with her about it. I take the medication and work on better habits, and hopefully she will see the results and we'll both be happy with them.","d4jnnuq",3,1466617850,"2016-06-22 17:50:50"

Here's my suggestion: if you're reading for pleasure, and you don't finish a book, *don't worry about it.* Are you a perfectionist? (I am). Get used to the idea that you don't have to read a book perfectly. Maybe the reason you tire of reading a book is because the book is actually boring?

Another thing to try: Read short fiction. Short fiction is great because if after half a page--or half a paragraph--you feel like moving on, then by all means, do so! There's too much to read anyway. If you're quitting on a book because it's not holding your interest, you've just made more time for reading something you might like better!","cs9rwr7",1,1434563067,"2015-06-17 17:44:27"

"4611","You need to follow up with your psychiatrist. 

In my line of work I have to say “I am not a physician I can’t and won’t give medical advice”. I work in medical research involving pharmaceuticals, and have ADHD myself. 

That being said I can share a little bit about how the medical system treats ADHD and other brain disorders. 

Unfortunately medicating ADHD is an educated guessing game. It isn’t like diabetes where we can draw some blood, test your blood sugar, and adjust your insulin dose accordingly. There is no way to do a blood test or brain scan and measure “the level” of ADHD you have and what medications you will respond to. We just don’t have the technology or understanding of the brain to do something so concrete yet. We all breakdown medications at a different rate. There’s some general rules of thumb and estimates but everyone is different. 

What happens is the psychiatrist makes an educated guess based on your symptoms, what medications they think fits best for your unique circumstances, what they’ve seen work best with other patients, and what they are comfortable prescribing. Then they depend on you the patient to report if it works or not. A good psychiatrist should not only be open to this feedback but welcome it. 

I will say quarantine is a weird time for anyone, but I personally think its ADHD hell. I know my med combo works but I’ve been struggling on my work from home days. There is something about going in to the office / school that signals to my brain I need to focus. So that is why you need to talk it out with your psychiatrist. 

Meds were life changing to a point for me. They made it possible for me to do the hard work to learn better habits. But you still have to do the hard work of reprogramming out bad habits.","fq2ptqv",2,1589058462,"2020-05-09 21:07:42"

Vyvanse seems to be perfect for me because I’ve experienced no other major side effects from it!She said the same thing— wait it out, and take melatonin in the meantime. Melatonin seemed to work initially, or maybe it was a placebo, but it doesn’t work as well anymore. I’ll start to feel really sleepy for about 5 minutes, but then something in my room would distract me (a tiny creak, light of a passing car coming through my window, or even a random thought) and I’ll be wide awake again. 

I definitely need to put my phone away, but it’s actually helped me to fall asleep a couple of times. For some reason, passively watching a YouTube video droning in the background cuts out the other stimuli from my room. A couple of times, I’ve found myself waking up to my phone next to my face in the AM, not realizing I’d fallen asleep watching videos. 

I think I’ll try taking Vyvanse later so that I can sleep in a bit. In the beginning I was able to take Vyvanse at 6:30 and fall right back to sleep, but now I wake up and get really anxious about falling sleep again, so I don’t.

I certainly wouldn't give that to a child or my own spawn. 
It's your life and child, I'm just saying what I have to say.

Personally, for a child so young.... why not explore the MANY other options and give him stimulants later in life. There are so many things I have done that have improved all kinds of symptoms. Fish oil is huge! You should really look into inflammation from the diet as well. Give your child more omega 3's, give it a week and watch what happens. If you can eat fatty fish(salmon, herring, mackerel, sardines, anchovies) 3x a week, you'll notice it.
For real, start with the diet thing first, try to go hardcore with it.
I'm conscious of every bite I take and every molecule within that bite, everything matters, you're also what you eat quite literally. The average American diet is super inflammatory, leading to every symptom imaginable(add, depression, diabetes, heart problems, pain, all kinds of stuff.) You can totally change your life by consuming the right fats and leaving out the garbage...

First of all, know that it is so natural to be upset about this. This sounds like a huge moment for you, a pivotal event in your life. It sounds like you have walked with a heavy burden for many years. Of course this is tough, upsetting and depressing. You are right in the middle of it, me too. I know I'm not ready to let go of that grief just yet, we haven't even gotten an official diagnosis yet.

I don't believe things happen for a reason, but I do believe that we have the power to add meaning to a lot of meaningless things. For example, I can use this experience to make other peoples lives better. My experiences can be shared so I can prevent it from happening to someone else. I can look back at my life, ask ""how did this happen?"" and maybe I can get someone to get tested at 15 and not 26. Then I feel like I've added meaning to this experience.

And lastly, as someone else mentioned, you simply can't know it would have been better being diagnosed at a younger age. There is a great chance, absolutely, but we simply can't know.

But for now: grieve, be angry and talk about it. I'm right there with you. Later on we won't just see what could have been better, but also be grateful that it could have been much much worse. Take care!","d21qxde",1,1460584072,"2016-04-13 21:47:52"

"4713","One of my favorite jobs was working in the kitchen of a busy restaurant during dinner hour. It was exciting. Every dish sent out was a goal achieved. I knew the kitchen, I knew the orders, I understood how everything interacted, how to time everything down to the second. I was the kitchen god, I was the powerhouse, I was the best cook they had and the constant high-pressure rush was fun.

&amp;#x200B;

When my dog escaped his collar to chase a squirrel into a street, my sister stood beside me screaming and panicking. I snatched the leash and jogged after him, calling in a calm and assertive voice, and he turned and ran straight back to me. My sister was genuinely angry with me for not being more emotional or urgent about it. She doesn't understand that I did feel a great sense of urgency -- I just wasn't panicking. Urgency and panic aren't the same thing.   


I work a desk job now. I own a house. The never-ending stream of vague, distant goals leaves me in a constant state of high anxiety. My stress tolerance is almost nil because at any given point I have this list of thirty or forty tasks in my head that I need to do...at some point....in some order...I think....and anything else added to that list feels like the universe spitting in my face.   


The thought of going to work in a busy kitchen, or as a firefighter, or some other high-stress job is downright soothing. The thought of having to come home to do the laundry -- every single week -- makes me want to scream.","eod1mb4",34,1558467157,"2019-05-21 19:32:37"

"4738","The good and the bad of medication is seeing how much of you is you and how much is ADHD. The good news, all the good parts of you are you! The bad news some(not all by a long shot) of the bad parts are you too.

Depression, is also a hell of a thing. It's a cruel doubtful voice that sits around and tells you how little faith it has in you and in the world AND that stupid fuckhead depression has no concept of the future. To depression, the next week or month are allowed to exist, as long as they are just like yesterday and today. But way off, in a time when changes have taken place (very small and very slow)and things are better, we dont talk about that, we dont think about that, we arent allowed to have that. So says depression.

I just wrote a big ol comment in another thread about how I related to my past self as someone that kept fucking me. And present me was just so disconnected from that person that even as I was fucking future me(while ironically not thinking about them at all!) I was resenting past me. I got my drugs, and I started trying to think about the future. Maybe I'll just set out my clothes, maybe I'll just put away these keys on the counter. I didnt have to do everything, I didnt have to catch up from where I was and get ahead at the same time. I just had(no, actually, I didnt have to. I could just leave it and deal with it later) to do this one thing, or half this thing, or a third of this thing. Thats right! I would want to do something and I'd do a third of it! 

""Dumb bitetheboxer couldnt even finish that thing she started. She didnt even do 1 of the 30 fucking things she was supposed to do she did a third of it!"" So I had to say to myself ""stop. Would you be this mean to bitetheboxers friend? Or sibling? No. Bitetheboxer you did something and you'll get there."" You know what's great?! Doing your laundry, and taking it out of the dryer and folding it and putting it away and setting out your clothes for tomorrow. You know what else is great?! Just doing your laundry and putting it in the basket, and if you're feeling super adventurous pulling a pair of undies and socks to the top of the basket to make life easier later. Or! Just doing your laundry? What if you cant find all of it? What if you left some out somewhere? That's ok! Just start it up! Just get as far as you can!

 You sir, have just discovered you're the turtle in the tortoise and the hair race(you've also just realized being the bunny got you fuck all). I also like to think of myself as Dory from Finding Nemo. She has NO MEMORY if you arent familier, but she has a wonderful attitude and she says ""just keep swimming"" ""just keep swimming"" and she does. Its SUPER DUMB to be a fully grown adult that's frustrated with real life Bills and tasks and just think of myself as a gotdamn goldfish, but here we are and it works. Any direction is forward.

It's really discouraging at first, because as you are trying to convince yourself doing less than one thing on a list 30 is ok, 5 more things pop up. So for a bit, the list is growing and growing and progress is so small. Does it matter at all even? But a shift happens somewhere... who knows when. Things fall off the list around the same time that they also get easier to do. Example: I lost half my laundry so even though I did it I have to do another half load so I'll have pants for tomorrow. So I added a thing on my list even though I was trying to take it off! &gt;:( but then, next time I put it all away and the time I saved on that half load and not looking for clothes gave me time to do x. So NOW, i cross 2 half loads off the list for the price of one AND whatever the next thing was too! 

What else... oh I just quit caring about some stuff. I have piles places and I forget stuff and I think at some point I was sad I promised to hang out with people half as much.(I mean, I made the decision to not hang out with 5 people for an hour, instead to hang out with 2 people for 2 hours later in the day) But I was more likely to actually go hang out and not be stressed or super late or rushed. 

Like some fucking paradox, the less I said I would do the more I had time to do. The more I said it was ok to set a meeting for 10am than 7am the more my schedule shifted toward 7am(very very incrementally). Oh and I'd play a dumb game, ""can I be out of bed and dressed by the end of this song?"" Start the song, clocks ticking gotta get out of bed, it's only 3(to 6)minutes how far into this day can I get! I used to pick ""motivate me"" by good Charlotte for irony points. I had a BF that would set an alarm take his adderall and go back to sleep for 15 min. I can sleep through that but it worked for him.

THIS WHOLE SUB IS, AND IS FILLED WITH COPING MECHANISMS. And late starters. Pick up those coping mechanisms and give them a try, and then give them a try again! I have day planners that I used intermittently forever and I'd get so frustrated when I'd lose them and find them and lose them again! So what, I still have day planners. And they help, not as much as the might if I tied them to me, but enough that half of one is better than none. (And now, here we are 2 weeks into june and I need a new one. A year ago I'd be mad, but I'm reframing. 2 years ago I bought a planner that started in june in september, this year ""isn't it great to buy a day planner in june that starts in june?) A lot of us also set alarms in our phones. Theres apps to make habits. Habit tracker, habit bull and some others. 

Anyways, depression is a fucking time thief(so is ADHD) and they've stolen your life savings. Just TAKE it back. 3 min at a time, 6 min at a time, and when you feel down look at all the time you took back not all the time you lost. The smallest thing I did to start all of this, is if I saw something that ""didnt belong there"" I just put it away. That's not even a minute! I could do that! And I did.

This was long, ranty, all over the place. I'm sorry about before. I'm happy you're here now. I wish you a lot of luck.","ftlx21q",2,1591812680,"2020-06-10 18:11:20"

I’ve been on Adderall for a few months now and here are my biggest pieces of advice for when you’re just starting!

The beginning is the best. You feel great, happy, energetic and talkative. Use this to start new, productive DAILY! habits. Start planning out your days/weeks in a reminder app on your phone. Keep. Doing. This. Unfortunately, you’ll start getting used to your meds and you’ll start to veer off course a little bit. They aren’t a be all end all, and they won’t do things for you, so you’ll still need to have the “I have to do this, and I’ll do it now” mantra in your head. Also, you’re going to get the good ol’ “I need to reach out to this person I haven’t talked to in 6 months” feeling but honestly... wait until the next day to see if you’re sure lol.

"4767","I've been on it. Both of the stimulant classes have similar sets of side effects; they tend to hit to slightly different degrees, depending on the person, formulation and dose. So there isn't really a way to know what Focalin will do till you try it. Maybe test yourself on an exercise bike that takes your heartrate while riding, if you have access to one. Comparing noon and nighttime highs and recovery times should give you a decent idea of how you're being affected.

(If worried about b.p. you might consider taking daily Omega 3s while on stimulants. They give modest ADHD treatment to some, as well as taking the edge off certain drug side effects - and, for some, lowering blood pressure and cholesterol.)

Appetite suppression usually fades away in a few weeks on low stimulant doses. I have it slightly worse with methylphenidate products, including Concerta and Focalin, but others experience the opposite.","d7yfdaz",1,1474601343,"2016-09-23 03:29:03"

"4788","&gt; What if my optimum is 36 plus a 10mg to make 46mg?

The 10mg is IR Ritalin right? You can't add them together in that way, because the 36mg of Concerta is Extended Release, while the 10mg is Immediate Release. 

The key is what your blood level of methylphenidate is, which depends on when you take the 10mg (the number of hours after taking Concerta). For example, if you take 10mg of Ritalin 1 hour after taking Concerta, that will probably result in a different serum level of methylphenidate than if you took it 4 hours after taking the Concerta. Additionally, the Ritalin has a different release timing than the Concerta - it's the reason why at the same dose in miligrams, Ritalin will always feel stronger than Concerta (and last a shorter period of time). 

Your Psychiatrist will know how to convert and add effectively.

"4809","Here’s my real issue with this. You give an XYZ formula as an example to follow. Then when challenged on it, you don’t actually use XYZ and that for sensitive passwords you use XYABZ anyway. Further you can supposedly remember 50 unique passwords following 10 different formulas that all exceed 25 characters. You’re giving poor advice that not even you follow. There are probably people on here that don’t know better.  And I doubt most people can remember that many unique, long passwords across that many formulas if they did infer that XYZ was an overly simple example.


All that aside, you want random passwords. There is not much random about your approach which is less than ideal. You’re going to be more of a challenge than the folks using the same 3 weak passwords for everything but you could be doing a lot better.


Nobody is likely to try to brute force a password character by character. Your password is pretty strong assuming there are no patterns, words, or grouping of character types. But an attacker will assume there are those very 3 things because that’s how people make passwords. A whole third of your example would no doubt be at the top of the dictionary used in an attack because it’s the name of the service.


A decentralized password vault  with a high entropy password, stored behind a 2 factor authenticated cloud account that is only logged in on encrypted devices, and is resistant to brute force attacks is going to be more secure, more convenient, and most people are capable of using it.

"4833","I still feel fraudulent for claiming I have ADHD because it’s so inaccurately named and because people *still* assume it’s a “hyperactive young boy” condition. Even I can’t help that image springing to mind when I think of the name.

I’m a 34 year old woman and have almost never been hyperactive, at least physically (except maybe during more excitable phases in childhood), in fact I’ve always been on the “lazy” side physically, it’s my mind that’s usually all over the place. I literally never got into trouble for behavioural issues, if you don’t count being scolded increasingly often as I got older for not keeping up with my homework and not being able to answer questions I’d just been asked because I hadn’t even been listening. I was actually a model pupil up until high school when I apparently lost whatever motivation I had to do well and just sort of imploded. “Taking initiative” is something which has never come naturally to me, except in rare moments of being “in the zone” when everything which I need to do something finally comes into alignment. To all outward appearances I’m just an otherwise potentially normal person who never quite managed to keep up with everyone else academically, socially and career wise, except for occasions where I’d overtake them during a “surge” but only then for a brief time. It feels like everything I want is tantalisingly within reach and it’s only my stupid habits and tendencies which are standing in my way... or maybe I just never wanted these things enough. I’ve just sort of muddled through life in dribs and drabs, achieving enough success (eventually) to make others think that I really am normal and capable after all, but never quite enough to really ever be in sync with the rest of the world.

To attribute all of this to an “attention deficit” feels to me like a great oversimplification, although it’s unarguable that it has certainly contributed to my difficulties. I’d love to be able to “see something through” to the point where it actually pays off but I never know how long it’s even worth sticking with anything, especially with how uncertain the world has become. So yeah I’d be all for renaming the condition - “executive functioning disorder” is a decent contender though- but I’m still at a loss as to what few words would most accurately encapsulate the lived experience.","g455wli",1,1599325724,"2020-09-05 17:08:44"

My son with asd isn't lacking much in receptive language, but struggles very much with expressive language. Communicating thoughts and ideas are a problem for him. He also tends to not enunciate his words clearly. He's considered pretty typical as far as speech delays caused by autism go.

My son with adhd struggles more with pronunciation and clarity. He's 10 and still replaces ""L"" or ""R"" sounds with a ""W"" sound. The vocabulary is there, but he mispronounces words and sometimes struggles to convey his ideas clearly. It's obvious that the ideas get jumbled up on their way out sometimes.

"4844","It was totally by accident.  About 4 years ago I was part of a splurge group (a group of women that met up once a month, drank wine, spent the evening talking..and we would each put $40 in a bowl that someone would win at the end of the night (everyone win once a year).  Most of the women bought jewellery or fancy shoes or expensive purses...but I didn't.  The first year I bought snow shoes (they thought I was so weird) and the following year I bought myself paints, an easel, brushes and a couple of canvases.  I started painting for fun, for like, therapy. I was really unhappy in my life...I had just went through a bad break up, and I knew my business had run its course and I was really bummed about needing to find an actual job working for a company...I just wasn't in a good place. 

But I painted when I had time, and it was very calming for me...and I would hang up my paintings in my house when they were done (and rotate them out with new ones) and I really enjoyed having new artwork to look at all the time.  Looking back now, they weren't very good.  But I really liked how I felt when I painted...so I kept at it...eventually friends and clients started asking me if I was selling them.  I was shocked that anyone wanted to buy anything I made...but....  I sold a few...and that covered the cost of new supplies...and eventually I had enough paintings to rent a booth in a market...and people were really excited about my paintings.  I'm not trained, so my style is completely unique...and I'm sure I do everything wrong...but all these people came up to me and we're so kind and so supportive...I felt like I had found a community that I might actually fit into.  It was such a huge boost to my self esteem...and it's funny, back then I sold them for a few hundred dollars and I thought that was like, amazing.  It's been three years...my average painting sells for $4,000 and I'm able to support myself doing it....and I just feel so fortunate.  Every time I do a show, I'm filled with gratefulness that people love what I do....love who I am (because I am my art).  

And it was all totally by chance that I got into it.  I'm always pushing, ""try new things, take up new hobbies and interests"" and people think I'm a broken record...but being open to new possibilities...changed my life in the most profound way.  You just never know when your life will take on a new meaning...so be open.  The world has so much to offer us. ","dl19bbd",7,1501627533,"2017-08-01 22:45:33"

"4847","As someone who has been diagnosed with it from a really early age, I'm not sure this is ENTIRELY an adhd thing. It's a tough situation because the adhd brain really craves entertainment, excitement or happiness, so when people come to us with problems like these, our brains tend to drift and focus on more appealing things. For me, it's pretty strenuous to console friends with tough problems, because I very desperately want to care about what they're going through, but my brain makes that super difficult. That being said, I try my best to be there when I'm needed, especially for those that I myself lean on. I don't know your friend, so I can't speak on the type of person he is, but I will say this: first off, adhd doesn't make it so you ""can't"" do things, it just makes them real difficult. Second, adhd doesn't just make you forget large long term things like you mentioned. I forget where I put my keys, wallet, phone, etc. every single day, but I would never forget about the problems of a struggling friend after just a few months. One thing I will mention though is hyperfocus is a big part of adhd. If your friend was already working on creating the game before you came to him for help, then it makes sense that he would have a hard time focusing on an upsetting conversation. This is getting a little long, so I'll end it with a few final thoughts: I'm sure the issues you are experiencing with your friend are in some way tied to his adhd, HOWEVER, if he was interested in trying to be a good friend, he would try his best to help you when you're struggling. Lastly, having adhd is never an excuse to treat those who care about you poorly. If he is constantly using that to make your problems seems less important, then he's probably not a true friend. I'm sorry this was so long, but I hope it helped.","glgieky",4,1612076730,"2021-01-31 07:05:30"

"4856","Your lack of attentiveness in this situation could be due to hyperarousal making it difficult to focus- as in, I'm so intense right now I can't focus. This would support more of the anxiety hypothesis, vs. the ADHD hypothesis. If you're not hyperaroused, then you should feel calm and collected, but still have the behaviors you just mentioned. Your skimming and moving around behavior certainly does sound like it could be consistent with ADHD. 

As far as what your doc said- yes and maybe. Certainly with anxiety the circuits become well-trodden. So if the behaviors you are engaging in such as pacing (common sign of agitation) and flitting from thing to thing are behavior patterns you got into due to anxiety in order to avoid becoming overwhelmed by any one thing, then it is possible it is due to your anxiety, and you are habituated to these coping mechanisms that limit your task persistence even when you aren't feeling anxious. 

However, if you your flitting behavior does not serve the purpose of temporarily regulating your anxiety, but is simply because other things look ""shiny,"" then that points more to the ADHD. 

In both anxiety and ADHD, it is not uncommon for focus to be better on some things than others. In ADHD in particular interest areas can become hyperfocused as the brain derives pleasure from being skilled at something, which then makes it harder to go back to non-skilled activities (everything else). In anxiety it is similar, bu the behaviors have more to do with comfort level, and you won't quit the behavior because it is familiar and comforting compared to the comparative chaos of other activities. 

Whatever the case, your focus will improve if you do some heavy (weight-lifting, body weight) exercises, or some vigorous aerobic exercises. Both serve the double benefit of down-regulating your ""bottom-up"" processes while enhancing your ""top-down"" processing.

Also for both disorders, do what you can to make your physical and temporal environments as friendly and predictable as possible. When I say physical environment, I mean make sure your places where you spend the most time are not messy. I know this is much more easily said than done, but having a neat, organized environment contributes on a subconcious level to your neurological arousal, as well as diminishing the task demands on you in the environment. Temporal organization refers to having a well-established daily routine- the more unpredictability in your life, the more either disorder will impair you. 

Finally, and I don't mean to be crass here and apologize if this seems crude, but you might consider masturbating. Masturbation, even if you don't orgasm, has a hotline to your parasympathetic (calming) somatic (bodily) nervous system, and lots of people whose nervous systems are running too ""hot"" much of the time due to a higher level of neurophysiological arousal (this is usually the case with anxiety) find that they function better after masturbation. 

In summary- based on your reply, it does sound like ADHD could be part of the picture, but it's hard to say at this point. I would look at it from the perspective of trying to get your anxiety in hand for now- you won't be able to tackle ADHD as effectively even if you have it until those foundational, bottom-up processes are running smoothly. Get regulated to the point where you are feeling comfortable inside your own skin using meds, therapy, lifestyle change, whatever it takes, and then if you are still flitting from thing to thing a lot I would come back around to the ADHD idea. I'm not saying you don't have it- it just sounds from the profile you've given me like you'll benefit from the universal interventions such as exercise and lifestyle change before you'll benefit from treatments that target ADHD specifically. 

I do think that your doctor is doing the best she/he can, but I would probably also ask for a referral to a mental health professional who does either mindfulness or cognitive behavioral therapy (nowadays many people do a mixed approach). Meds are often ineffective or less effective without therapy, and a therapist can help you break up those ""well-trodden paths"" in a guided, meaningful way that will ""stick"" after therapy. I would also tell your therapist about your ADHD hypothesis- explain your reasoning, and tell them what I've told you in this post. See what they think with their more complete information, and see how they recommend proceeding with both your therapy and with your doctor. 

Remember that at the end of the day, a diagnosis is nice but really only serves you insofar as it qualifies you for treatment and services. Finding good strategies to function from day to day in a meaningful, effective, and joyful way is the absolute bottom line for *any* intervention approach- and your treatment plan should look at that. I wish you the very best of luck with your mental health- and end this reply by reminding you that while problems such as ADHD and anxiety do tend to chronically dog people, improvement to some extent is the rule, not the exception, and that you are on your way to it by asking questions and thinking introspectively.

"4866","&gt;1) My mood swings...

This is a fair point. Consider both of you being allowed to call ""time out"" if things get heated. Sometimes you just need to step back for a couple of hours to make sense of things before you can have a rational discussion

&gt;2) Self-awareness. I have a dark sense of humor, and I find humor in a lot of different things...  ...My friends laugh because they know me. But with this guy, I have to remind myself that it might get annoying to him. That's normal for any relationship...

That's not normal for any relationships. You want him to know you and love you. Not some idealised version of you. If he doesn't get your sense of humour then that's his problem.

&gt;3) Don't verbalize every thought you have in your head... ...now I have to ask myself, ""Is this something he'll care to hear about or is it pointless?""...

Again; you need to be you. As long as sharing your thoughts isn't causing a direct problem (e.g. distracting him from something important, making him actively uncomfortable, etc) then why shouldn't you share them? A conversation is more interesting than silence. 

&gt;4) Not using ADHD as an excuse, but making sure not to ignore it either...  ...I'm still responsible for my own behavior.

This is a good one. It isn't an excuse. You need to find a way to function as a couple. This might mean sharing information and asking for assistance but it definitely doesn't mean being allowed to do whatever you like without consequences.

&gt;5) This relationship probably won't last, and I have to learn how to cope with that. 

On a long enough timescale nothing lasts, relationships included. Make the most of it. Enjoy each day for what it is. When it ends (and some time in the next 100 years it will) be grateful for what you had, not bitter that it finished. Thing of it like a great movie or favourite book. You don't get upset just because the credits roll.

This is actually something where I think ADHD helps us. We tend to live in the moment more than other people. While that does have its downsides it also helps us appreciate each day and then to move on once they are over. The past doesn't hold us as tightly as other people.

I do find your case atypical, in that you state you are doing very well in all the major areas of life.

""at work I often find myself on Youtube or Wikipedia when I have tasks to accomplish""

I am not questioning your diagnosis, but the above statement would seem to be larger than just an ADHD issue.

You must feel reasonably entitled and not worried about consequences to do that. I mean if I worked, and could fairly easily get away with doing that, I would be tempted to as well. It would be different however if I was strictly monitored and knew that if I did it once I would immediately be fired.

It would also be different for me, depending on how serious what I was doing was. For example, I would not say ""my adhd could cause the baby to drown in the bath, because the whole time they are in the bath I find myself in the loungeroom on youtube"".

"4891","Hi Dr. Barkley, thanks for your time. (question at the end)

I work in a college. Though I'm not a teacher, many of my colleagues are. I have ADD myself (or Sluggish Cognitive Syndrome, if I recall correctly), but I have a hard time explaining to my colleagues how people with ADHD/ADD should be thought differently, a lot of them seem to believe failing in college means one wouldn't fit in a job that asks for certain credentials (diploma) anyway.

I feel like they need a better understanding of what ADHD/ADD really is. But I hardly can explain how I'm different than most people.

1 example I usually give is: The cocktail party effect, where in a room filled with conversations most people can hear their name being said across the room. Meaning that people probably process all conversations around them while they're still able to focus on the one conversation they're involved in. I, on the other hand, constantly hear all conversations going on around me, to the point that it's very difficult or even impossible to focus on just 1 conversation.

That's how I try to explain why it's important that distractions should be avoided in the classroom as much as possible, because they will overflow the working memory. (I don't know if my explanation is correct though.)

But I don't know how to relate the time blindness, or the lacking in vocabulary sometimes, lack in organization skills, the seeming impossibility to transition from theory to practice...

Especially the last one. In my own life I've experienced many times, when someone walks me through the steps of a certain job I quickly learn how to do it myself, but if I have to figure it out myself I could never keep up with my peers, or worse I end up failing to deliver...

**So, my question: How do I relate time blindness, not being able to recall words, difficulty in organizing, difficulty in transitioning from theory to practice...  in a way that explains how we're different. And in a way that shows how we can overcome these difficulties without being a liability on the job?**

"4892","TL;DR: yes, but not in the conventional sense of practicing and honing. Also, tangent, but love your weird!

On and off. I basically learned that practicing tiny pieces of things and learning theory/methods for anything doesn't work. I also understand that even though there are looooooooong stretches of time where I won't do anything creative, it's more of a mindset. Seeing patterns and connections others don't gives a lot of unconventional wisdom and insight. 

For me, this has lead me to having different conversations about interpreting things from TV to literature than others may have. I think a lot of ADHDers learn to hide any thoughts or conjectures are unconventional because we've been burned for being ""weird."" I say find contexts where it works for you and lean in! I was a great literature major but could NEVER do engineering, business, etc

"4897","Yeah, it's a real bitch. I was only diagnosed about 6 months ago at the age of 24, but I remember my *entire* life my mom would always have to say ""stop taking things so personally"" or ""its not something to get so upset about"". Or literally the minute I leave a social interaction being borderline paranoid that I had said something that caused someone to feel angry or sad, and would replay, sometimes to the point of mental exhaustion, interactions that I thought could have possibly been negative. Things that normal people aren't even phased by. Just today, I was interacting with a friend that I communicate with, once a day at *least* if not more than that, and for no reason, no reason at all, my brain suddenly went ""well she thinks you're being too clingy"" and suddenly I was analyzing and over analyzing my interaction with her ( and interactions over the last week) to figure out if it was true or not. For no fucking reason. 

I think other than being wildly disorganized, this is the biggest struggle for me as someone with ADHD because it's shaped how I interact with, trust, and make friends with other people. And it was slightly crushing to realize that at 24 the things you felt you genuinely thought (or were rightly entitled to think) could have been because a chemical imbalance in your brain.

"4900","Nope, been a coffee drinker since I was 11. I'm talking multiple double shot espressos daily for months at a time. I currently only have one in the morning and usually a can or two of coke in the day. Caffeine does give you a rush and it's not pleasant if you overdo it, which is relatively easy. You'll know because it'll cause shakes, sweating and your heart will race. Although even after years of tolerance it still happens to me, and exacerbates anxiety, if I suddenly have too much one morning/afternoon.

Dex on the other hand calms me down and lets me focus in a very smooth manner. Caffeine is good for waking me up but has too many peripheral effects if I have more than I'm tolerant to on any given day. Reminds me of the horrible shakes I got from trying concerta for ADHD a while ago.

And I find caffeine makes the dex much stronger, and vice versa, so I had to reduce my caffeine intake when I started it.","d28lwm4",1,1461049153,"2016-04-19 06:59:13"

I can relate to most of the emotional symptoms, but I felt it was something I had to go through like all other persons, and I naturally did as I grew older. My first instinct is to think that will power can overcome these things. I know that is very ignorant, but it just seems logical to me.

Here are some biggies: check out neuroplasticity. The brain changes (grows) according to how we treat it (exercise it, so to speak) and one of the big ways to change things is via mindfulness meditation.

See also learning an instrument, reading, etc. These strengthen brain connections.

For example, this might sound dumb, but I'll hyperfocus when I'm getting ready to leave the house. That's always been a hyper-focus issue of mine, even before meds. But I thought that I would be faster at getting ready and be more efficiently out the door. 

Unfortunately, that hasn't subsided at all.. I'm hyperfocusing and often late because I take so long getting ready. I'm also hyperfocusing on tasks that are unrelated to my work, i.e., I've been at the library to finish some work since 1:30pm.. this is a solid 2 hours into my reddit spiral....

Even though I have the tools to deal with my ADHD now, I'm still being punished for my poor grades that I had before I was diagnosed.  This is why I can't stand religion anymore.

As for places to hide your meds if that’s what you want to do, like others suggested above, tape them under a drawer, place them in a safe, in a box of food you know she doesn’t like and would be unlikely to grab, inside a pair of rolled up socks, hide it in hobby materials you don’t share with her.. there are many options.

Your very well educated mental healthcare professional is great, but the fact that they're denying one of the absolutely most basic facts about stimulants suggests that they're either an idiot, uninformed, or lying to you.

Letting myself use social media for 5-10 minutes (I use a timer) before I get up, mostly unconscious me will turn all my alarms off, allowing myself time to scroll and slowly wake up was really helpful

Making a nice breakfast for myself, it's hard to wake up to food that you don't enjoy at least a little, it's not expensive but it's high in protein and tastes good, over breakfast I'll check out my to do list which is it's own funky little system

I got a fancy shower scrub from my sister and coconut shampoo and conditioner from my mum for my birthday and so shower time is all about sensory recharging

The first thing I do after all that is tidy my room and work space, this really helps focus me

"4971","Watch 30 things about adhd everyone should know by Dr. Barkely on YouTube.  It's a nearly 3 hours presentation but will give you a lot of insight into the core features of adhd.

Some of your dissassociative symptoms are a bit concerning (being unsure what you feel, what you are typing not understanding.) 

I recommend not taking double dosages as always but even/Especially for you right now.  It sounds like what you are getting from it mostly is euphoria and thus motivation.

Emotion is motivation, and what you should be trying to do is use that thing that happened when you feel good and then sad because it makes you think about when you felt sad : follow this up by thinking ''hey but feeling sad right now is kind of happy because I'm only sad because I have a reason to feel happy, and I don't need to always feel sad now.'' This is like super basic cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a set of techniques you need to learn, and medication enables.  

So my two recommendations.... well three.

One.  Go see your doctor, I know it's hard and embarrassing but you shouldn't feel anything but calm and hopeful about it. Try to summon those emotions even by talking to yourself out loud.  Make the appointment and share all these points except taking more medication which is not a good idea to do or share if you do... thankfully your double dose is at a level it isn't horrifically dangerous.

Two. : look up free CBT information online or seek it out in terms of therapy.  The tools are as vital as medication for thriving and learning to understand and interact with oneself.","d1xeylf",1,1460307300,"2016-04-10 16:55:00"

I’ve been struggling with the same issues, and find after a week of 12 hour stressful days at work is to spend nights/weekends on my phone and doing little else.  I seem to be blaming the meds not working on what is really just a fucked up work situation.  

I took a new position about a year ago in the same company - it’s a great title and pay, but just a shit situation.  I could easily get a job somewhere else, but I’m unsure if my job is shit because it’s shit period, or if it’s the lack of organization in my company that makes it shit.  So needless to say, I’m not happy.  I’ve wanted to leave for a little over a year now, but since my husband and I are trying to get pregnant, I feel stuck (in the US, you have to be with an employer for 12 months before maternity benefits kick in).  I found a the current more enticing role within the company, and this is what made me realize - it wasn’t the job, it’s definitely the company.

It's a God damn shame this is thrown around in society so much, but the science is fairy clear that the medication ''enables you to flex the muscle'' and without that enabling it is hard as hell or impossible to do that, so you use other muscles to make up for it more or less.  That isn't recovery it is (mal)adaption.  Cognitive behavioral therapy and medication, and as I said otherwise I'd really suggest trying vyvanse seeing as its a very long XR that is 100 percent the primary active ingredient of the medication you ever had the most success with....

"4984","I taught at a public high school for a few years, and had a lot of experience with IEPs. I was never a part of starting services for a student, and the district I was in was very dysfunctional, so apologies if my advice is not applicable to your situation.

The biggest thing to remember is that, in the eyes of the law, you as a parent get to direct this process. Schools and districts that knowingly deny adequate services to students with special needs face VERY serious legal repercussions. So, frankly, you are unlikely to get much resistance, because you are a potential law suit. Schools tend to err on the side of not getting in trouble. And, less cynically, these people all want to do a good job for your son; if there is something that is stopping him from achieving at his highest level, they want to address it. The fact that you are bringing somebody who has professionally diagnosed your son with a disability makes this pretty straightforward. But be assertive if you feel like you aren't being heard; you are well within your rights to do so.

I'm not surprised that your son's speech issues were addressed with a 504, but diagnosed ADHD is a different ball game. It's great that he has the opportunity to start these services early. A lot of my most successful students had been receiving services since they were your son's age. They had a strong understanding of their learning styles, and were very invested in school. By the time they got to me, their IEPs had been deescalated considerably. All those years of services had gotten them to a place where they could succeed without much extra support.

Try to have some idea of what you want the school to do for him going in. Unless I'm misunderstanding your son's situation, it won't be anything too resource intensive; extra time on assignments, prescribed check-ins from the teacher during class, things like that. His psychologist can help, if you haven't thought about this already.

If your son is not struggling academically, and you are looking for more extreme accommodations, like a self-contained classroom, or a modified grading scale, you might meet some resistance. But, at his age, you are really just getting him into the system. It hopefully won't be too stressful. Best of luck, and if you have any specific questions I'm happy to tell you what I can.","cm17lx1",2,1415865334,"2014-11-13 07:55:34"

"4989","Comes down to the very same problems of self-regulation that we always associate with ADHD. I'll explain how it happens to me.

When you really like a song, hearing it provides instant gratification. When you perceive a way to be more stimulated, you work towards that end. When you have a song or two that you're obsessed with, you listen to them non-stop until you find one you like more. Then that one gets listened to until it loses enough of it's value, and unless you've found a new favorite song, you'll probably throw it in a rotation with your first two favorite songs. You know what these songs once did for you, so naturally, you skip between them when they're falling short. Until you find a new favorite song that you overplay and BOOM, you have four that you skip between. It goes on and on. Maybe the occasional one falls out of the mix, but you become convinced that you'll only enjoy listening to these four songs.

Here's what I do: say fuck music for a little bit. You're at the point where it's more frustrating. Focus on whatever task you need to do, and if it's something that you usually do with music, use Pandora. And have fun trying to pick a good station. And try to be open minded. And if you're not feeling it, switch it up until something sticks. Or just turn it off. It's not like music won't be there when you want it back.","ce3lvqt",1,1387253414,"2013-12-17 04:10:14"

"5004","This happens with lots of types of psych med. If a drug changes levels of a brain chemical, the brain changes in compensation. But when you stop taking the drug, the brain eventually changes back.

This is why you have to taper off antidepressants instead of stopping them immediately. Antidepressants raise serotonin levels, so a brain on antidepressants down-regulates its serotonin receptors and becomes less responsive to serotonin. If you stop taking your antidepressant abruptly, you get left in an unpleasant state where your brain has lower serotonin *and* lower responsiveness to the serotonin that you have. But if you taper off gradually, then as your serotonin levels go down, the brain can up-regulate the receptors and become more responsive to serotonin again. This all happens within the course of a few months.

The people in this study were measured while still on Ritalin. But if they stopped taking their Ritalin for a few months, their brains would probably go back to normal too.","dsz2dzi",3,1516469595,"2018-01-20 17:33:15"

There are two ""theories"" of causation with ODD, one is the developmental (nature) and the other is the learned (nurture)

* It was *implied* but not explicitly stated that you could not use notes on the test.

FWIW, that test is effectively worthless anyway. Teachers should *all* be required to take some psychology courses, IMHO. Learn how the brain actually works before they try to fill heads with stuff.

Here's the rub: you're making quick assumptions. Some might use the word impulsive to describe it. You need to take a moment before you start things to ensure you are drawing the correct conclusions about how and why. Ask someone if you're not certain. 

It's a logic puzzle with context clues. I naturally excel at them, so I don't have any proven suggestions for working on it. It can be helpful for tasks to outline them on paper before you start. Learn about mind maps and flow charts.

Blurting out 'what' *is* impulse. It's saying the first thing that comes to mind. I try to consider my words before they ever hit my lips or fingers. Words are powerful and once they leave your head, you can't take them back. Yes, this will add a delay to all your responses. That's ok as long as your response is weighed and measured. 

It helps to look backwards on your actions with 20/20 hindsight so you can figure out what you could have done differently. Learn from it. Just realize nobody got anywhere good without falling on their face along the way. 

Everybody makes mistakes. Everyone has character flaws. Everyone suffers foot-in-mouth at least some of the time. It's OK as long as you learn from it and don't repeat mistakes the same way. Remember that when you look back at yourself. That is hard.

"5041","&gt; What makes you assume that people with ADHD would be unproductive in a hunting/gathering environment? I have pretty bad ADHD and that sounds like something I’d excel at. You could work whenever you want to, would be constantly stimulated by nature, and getting off task wouldn’t really be that much of an issue without a boss or teacher to reprimand you.


Well the general idea is that in the sort of prehistoric hunter-gatherer society we’re talking about here, you wouldn’t get to choose when you worked and when you didn’t—you would work when it was necessary, or you wouldn’t survive, you know what I mean

It’s not like you wouldn’t have a boss—your “boss” is the tribe, and getting off task would get you more than a reprimand, it would get you stigmatized as lazy and undependable in the eyes of literally everybody you know, and might even get you ostracized from the group and driven out of the village, forced to fend for yourself in the wilderness because nobody understands what the disorder is or how it affects you, all they know is that they’re sick of wasting their hard work and resources on somebody who doesn’t contribute the same way everyone else does

If you’re *really really lucky*, circumstances might allow you to find some sort of role and sort of get by, or even thrive, provided that the disorder manifested in a specific way that was beneficial to the group—alternatively, you might be able to survive under the mentorship of an elder or a shaman who had enough experience and working knowledge to appropriately direct you and keep you on task and serve as a sort of external form of limited executive function—but this was almost certainly not the case for everyone with ADD/ADHD

So maybe you would personally succeed in such an environment—I sure as shit know that I wouldn’t, and I don’t think it’s particularly realistic to argue that anyone whose ADHD presents in a similar way as mine would fare any better","ebbze26",5,1544236952,"2018-12-08 02:42:32"

"5049","This is just me guessing. I have some expertise in this area but IANAD. I study drugs and I take drugs, but I don't counsel or prescribe. 

Ritalin is a dopamine agonist; it makes things feel more rewarding via a specific brain circuit. When dopamine function is ""normal"" then you're rewarded enough at baseline; you don't constantly have to seek excitement, letting you focus on less-exciting things. 

\- In the brain, one of the downstream effects of opioids is increasing the effects of dopamine. It's possible that your dopamine system hasn't quite recovered from the opiate use. It got used to all that extra dopamine and now it's like ""wait, I have to make all this on my own now?? crap I fired all those guys years ago and now I gotta restart the factory somehow!"" 

\- [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21545805) found that blocking opioid receptors in rats blocked the rewarding effect of Ritalin. Either the bupe (partial agonist) or naloxone (full antagonist) in your suboxone could be doing the same thing. 

Are you still tapering off the suboxone? It might get better right as soon as you stop. Or, it might just take time for your brain to get back to baseline dopaminergic function. Or you might just need a higher dose now. Hard to say.  ","e9l08ad",1,1542063157,"2018-11-12 22:52:37"

And oh, I know I've lost this battle. The worst part was when I moved the couch and discovered he just \*stores them\* where I won't find them. Except I did find them. And his reasoning was he wasn't near a bin but knew I don't like toenail . . . bits? around. D: It's honestly the worst part about him. Like, nothing else is even remotely like the toenail thing XD

Oooh callouses though! Ewwie. Although that's actually reminded me of something - I think my toenail fear comes from my Dad - he had his nail ripped off before I was born and it grew hard and disgusting and he used to threaten to touch us with it XD Just ewwie. 

My biggest problem is I can't even get turned on. It's like ""Really!?"" and I don't even have a good reason! I just don't want to. It feels like it takes so much timeeeeeee and then I have to shower againnnnnnnn and that's annoyinggggggggggg (even though I love showers) and when it's happening, if I can keep my thoughts focused, everything's fine, until I think about the fact I work with old people and everyone I work with has probably had sex and that I'm not married so they'd probably judge me and then something happens and I'm back in the moment but now the moment's weird on my end. :/ 

And yes! That's what I mean, the article is so vague! That's probably why I thought I had it years ago. But yeah, all my pain makes some kind of sense, it's mostly the weird sensations. I moved from QLD to VIC so the cold is colder and the heat is hotter, so I don't really know why I chose this! But yes, I wear a knee brace to keep my knee a little bit warmer when it's winter, but I have way too much ibuprofen to be healthy, but it works. And a duckdown jacket is also amazing. But at night, if the blanket gets pulled over the bf's side and I wake up, it's like everything is terrible and then I can never sleep again. It's like it just seeps into my joints. The stress is true, as well. Nothing like needing to sleep so I can go to uni and finish my assignment at some point before it's due and then being up all night because owwie and stress :( 

I fully suggest a sleep study! They're pretty cool (more like difficult to sleep with) and tell you important things, so if you don't know for sure if it's RLS or something else, you can usually rent them from a chemist. But yeah, CPAP is amazing. And also another barrier to intimacy because a) that's not sexy and b) if I'm all set up, then everything else is even less appealing. :P","f0e65a2",1,1568563693,"2019-09-15 16:08:13"

In the end, I think you have to look forward to how you see your future being with them. If they have broken up with you, and initiating being more intimate and pulling away repeatedly, get out of there. They are toying with you/ being selfish and not thinking of the impact on you. 

Sometimes its hard to let a dream die. But having been in abusive relationships before, I once read something, ""If someone tells you something about themselves, believe them"". If this person says they're not ready, they're not ready and may never be. Its sad and awful but in the long run its better to get out and be with someone who treats you right than to be unhappy forever.

"5085","&gt;So you're a woman, good for you.

Thank you? Man, and I'm the condescending one, way to project... Come on.

&gt;You know what, I am done talking to you. You always come here in a condescending fashion and try to tell everyone they are wrong

I tell people they are wrong only if they're actually wrong and I can prove such with evidence, otherwise I'm not going to get involved. However, I'm not above anyone and will gladly admit when I'm wrong.

Which I have already done in the past and will undoubtedly do again in the future, because I don't know everything and until my knowledge is challenged; I won't know any better, whether I challenge it myself or someone does so for me. 

That being said, with both topics we have now discussed, I know I am not wrong about my facts. And in the previous thread/interaction you actually failed to provide evidence to support your claim of understanding on hyperfocus, not to mention, how the brain works, claiming there's pockets of dopamine that get trapped, etc. You couldn't provide anything then or now but your entitled defense mechanisms.

I've been talking to you as a peer despite your snide comments towards me. So, it says something about you if you think I'm being condescending instead of trying to inform someone of what they might be saying is inaccurate. Which you should want to know if you're mistaken... And if so, you should take responsibility for it because it's not just you involved, as I mentioned in the last response.

&gt;seemingly just for the sake of it (""no, hyperfocus is not a thing with ADHD! Screw research, I am smarter!"").

As much as I would love to just say that I'm smarter and ""screw research"", there IS actual research that proves hyperfocus is a myth and is being mislabeled (straight from Russel Barkley's lectures too, which means you Still didn't do the research to even consider the notion that you might have an incorrect understanding on that topic, making me begin to doubt any other knowledge you lay out, simply because you're unwilling to question yourself and learn from it).

&gt;I have been living with a person that has autism for the past 5 years. Yes, he has been diagnosed by both a psychiatrist and a psychologist, thanks for grasping even more for straws to make your non-point. 

Misdiagnosis is a possibility, especially with mental disorders due to various overlapping symptoms... You of all people should know that, so not sure why you got so defensive unless you think the possibility is potentially true. 

Which would mean you don't know everything you thought you did because you base a lot off of your boyfriend. And if he has the wrong diagnosis and you've been telling people all these personal situations as fact, then your whole frame work is shattered... 

And you probably couldn't take that kind of self reflection without feeling a hit to your ego. So instead you say you're done with me, which conveniently provides the perfect opportunity for you to shed any responsibility for misinforming people (of which information is based mainly on your personal experiences).

&gt;I have been reading about it ever since he told me he had it, 7 years ago. Do tell me more about how I need to research more and I don't know anything about the subject!

There you go making general claims. I never said you don't know anything on the topic, that would be ridiculous. But that obvious statement aside, you really haven't provided much actual facts, just things your boyfriend does, as if everyone is supposed to take them as a fact without other supporting information.

If anything, I'm starting to really question your reliability, especially when it comes to said boyfriend. Even more so now with how you worded your last two clarifications above...

But anyways, I will correct again if you or anyone else misinforms people. That's why there are discussions here, this isn't a place to simply through out what you think is right and get upset when your thinking might be challenged. Being wrong is 100% okay, as long as responsibility is taken and change occurs.

And if I'm misinforming people, then I sure as Hell hope someone calls me out on it and debate the facts, so that I can actually learn where I'm wrong and grow my understanding.

All this aside, good luck with whatever you may be dealing with, and I hope you continue your research as you intend to continue with helping others.","d0h115e",1,1456680444,"2016-02-28 17:27:24"

I had been on Shire Cares, then in the Spring I found out at the pharmacy my card was expired (never received a letter like in the past), and got the run around before I even found out Takeda was now in charge of Shire Cares, and had switched to Takeda Help At Hand. It took 2 months of talking to over 10 different people back then to continue getting my Vyvanse covered. They had me submit a new application, telling me all the things that were wrong with it along the way, before eventually telling me they had just extended my Shire Cares card for 6 months: oh and here’s your new number, don’t worry your application is approved so you won’t have to go through this again. 

HAHAHAHAHA. 

Well, once again I learned my card was expired through the pharmacy (it hadn’t even been 6 months). When I called them to see what was up they said my application from the spring had been filed but never submitted to the approvals department and since it was over 90 days old I’d need to send in a new one. “But only these couple of forms, the rest look great!” Ok well that’s not what I was told but ok this shouldn’t be too bad.

HAHAHAHAHA

It’s now taken me talking to *another* 8 different people in the last 3 weeks, who all gave me completely contradictory information regarding my NEW application to finally be approved. However, my application this time was denied because my application was incomplete because they just “didn’t see” the rest of the paperwork from before in my file.

I finally legit yelled at them today and wouldn’t you know it, within 2 hours I was finally approved again. 

Basically what I’m saying is this company is trash. Is it great that they are covering vyvanse at all? Yes. But given that this is the only medication that works for people who already have a hard time staying organized and getting things done, their way of handling this program is reprehensible. 

We should be so “fortunate” we “only” have a mental illness where we can’t function without our medication, and not something like diabetes where we’d die without our insulin. It’s probably all in our heads. Maybe we should just try exercising and eating right. /s

Instead of holding yourself back, you end up running towards failure, because you learn much more from it. This is completely contradictory from the way the typical person's mind works, especially mine. But it is especially effective against the type of paralysis that you reference in many ADHD individuals that fear failure as I did, and still do to a degree. When you intentionally celebrate failure, it balances out the negative feelings that are naturally associated with it, and provides a more logical standpoint in your mind that you can analyze the situation in.

Big thing my sleep deprived brain can suggest, don’t assume that your kid will just understand how to do a task. Show them, show them multiple times. Help them break it down into smaller tasks and explain it. Your child is not neurologically the same as other children. Their brain is not wired the same.

"5133","YES! My whole life! At one point it was so overwhelmingly constant that I was driven further into depression just because of being surrounded by objects and looking at them. It's ridiculous yet I've many times felt my heart utterly breaking with sorrow because I was looking at a garden chair or the particular placement of my jacket on the bed and I felt SO BAD for them. I don't know what it is about inanimate objects that quietly carry such propensity for raw sadness and even pity. 

I've mostly gotten this under control but it comes back with a vengeance during panic attacks.

 I've found it's most common with human-made things, or anything to do with humans, really. Like, someone MADE this thing. They dedicated a part of their life to the thing, and given it its own energy, and here it is, just laying there at this moment in time. Whether its being used and appreciated or not, it's like the fact that it's *there* and it *exists* is heartbreaking for some reason.

May I ask if you also have this: If you see, for example, a really poorly-designed, ugly advertisement or something, you feel like a HORRIBLE person for being even slightly critical about the thing? Also do you ever just go about your day all fine and pass someone else just going about their day and you look at them and suddenly you feel this surge of grief for them and you wanna cry?","g6b93k3",1,1600864987,"2020-09-23 12:43:07"

"5150","Haha, yea, does sound like a rant.. But it's all good, that's what this is all about, getting your ideas out and how you feel... In my case, I'm an adult and ADHD is like a monkey on my back, a creature I can't shake off that seems to pull me in one way or another.. It's hard to control sometimes, even when I try my hardest to behave and keep from acting out.. Though I'm more mature than when I was a teenager, I still feel like a hyperactive kid sometimes... I am on medication but sometimes it still doesn't help and can cause unintended side effects... The hardest part of having to deal with ADHD is the friendships I've messed up along the way.. I've met some great ppl over the years but I find they quickly checked out of dealing with me when I got super annoying or clingy or overly excited about what not... Perhaps that's a good way to weed out true friends from ppl who don't give a crap (true friends will stand by you no matter what) but it still gets to you when you get to know a person, hang out with them a bit but soon realize little by little they start to avoid you or bail on you because they don't want to deal with a series of behaviours you struggle to come to grips with and maintain in check on a daily basis.. I dunno how people without ADHD handle their relationships but speaking as a person with ADHD I think it's the most complicated part of dealing with this disease... At times is can be unnerving and consumes my thoughts since I don't want to aggravate my friends... Luckily those who are closest to me have been in my life for years and have come to understand what I deal with... They claim don't need medication but they also realize it helps control my hyperactivity (a contradiction, I know)... Anyway, that's sorta my take on the whole thing...

"5159","Oh sure. Like benzodiazepines... those things are awful. No matter what, discontinuing long-term benzo use will lead to painful, horrible withdrawal. They even have rehab for it. 

But stimulants taken as prescribed do not build tolerance or form physical dependence. 

It's possible for it to be addicting, but that requires it to be harmful. If you really hate not to take it, if you feel like you have to take it, but it does nothing but (mostly) improve your life? That's not addiction. It's addiction if you have all that, but it's causing you harm and still do it anyway. People addicted to food getting fat, people addicted to sex destroying relationships, people addicted to video games not doing school work... that sort of thing. You can be addicted to anything, it's 100% mental. When people say ""addicted"" they usually mean something else, like dependent. 

Worst case with stimulants is you might be a little bit tired for a day or two. Some other super minor thing like that. Maybe. But mostly what people feel is their symptoms returning. 

If you stop taking your blood pressure pills, and your blood pressure goes back up. That's not withdrawal. If you stop taking your pain pills and your back hurts again. That's not withdrawal. That's just life. ","cyae0l7",3,1450992549,"2015-12-24 21:29:09"

&gt;we can hyperfocus on negative things just as well as wikipedia. Please please please talk to your psych about it. 

&gt; Try to take a step back and (since you are probably stuck in the feeling) instead of focusing on a loop of ""I am a screw up,"" ask, ""why do I feel like a screw up?""

"5167","Hi! B.S. in Chemistry here. You'll have to find what works for you, but I'm sure you can do it. Here some things that worked for me: 


*I often struggle with switching from one task to another, and that made coming home at night to sit and do several classes worth of homework feel terrible after a day of lectures. If I had the space between classes, I would immediately do my homework for something like a math class or lab with short write-ups. 


*Studying with instrumental music on helped. 


*Read the chapter before class. I found it easier to pay attention and take relevant notes if I was listening for information I needed a more thorough explanation for. 


*I did my reading when I had breaks between classes, or in the morning before class. Getting up to get to the library to read meant that I wasnt late for my first classes, and I established the library as a place where I accomplished things (rather than at home with so many other entertainment options). 


*The most important thing is to notice when something isn't working for you and change it. Don't worry about what SHOULD work or what works for everyone else. Do it the way that gets you the best results.

A lot of the anti-anxiety tricks I was taught felt like I was supposed to learn to feel ok about my life being a wreck, but it never worked for me because the state of my life was objectively not ok. The anxiety I had wasn’t the same as irrational worrying or nervousness. I would get extremely frustrated any time someone would try to tell me about mindfulness, it’s like telling someone to relax and observe the warm air against your skin when your house is burning down.

Street meth abuse is way different than therapeutic use too. Smoking 50mg of meth is average for a tweaker, but the FDA maximum daily limit is 25mg orally. Completely different ballgame. 

Desoxyn is interesting because it triggers the release of dopamine without triggering the flight or fight response caused by norephinephrine(adderall and Dexedrine do this). Because of this, Desoxyn is the least intrusive and speedy feeling ADHD med. ","dq8k25y",1,1511450139,"2017-11-23 15:15:39"

"5223","**On the subject of Celiac disease and ADHD.**  There has not been much study on this for they only recently identified the gene variants that you have to have for Celiac disease to actually happen.  Just because you have the genes though does not mean you are a celiac other things have to happen to activate the genes.

A couple studies have shown that ADHD people have celiac disease more than the general population.  One study showed at 15% occurrence rate in German ADHD kids while normally the chance of having celiac disease is around or less than 1% depending on your ethnicity.  The had all the kids remove gluten from their diet, the celiac that were recently diagnosed as well as the ADHD kids that do not have celiac.  After 6 months the 15% with celiac disease have seen dramatic reductions in their ADHD symptoms while the other 85% saw little to no improvement.

So in sum it is likely that if you have ADHD removing all gluten, wheat, rye, barley and products that have this as an ingredient may reduce your symptoms.  You have a 1 in 6 chance roughly to feel a lot better.  5 out of 6 ADHD people will see no improvement.  Do not do this before talking to your doctor for there is a gene test you can do to determine if you have the variation of the gene that causes celiac disease, if you do not have the variation then you will not see any improvement.

Or if you ask something and they answer, try then to reply with something related from yourself.

That said, if you are talking about something you like and are super excited about, never ""shut up"". Nobody gets mad at you for being excited. If you think you are boring them, just ask them about something they like and let them be fanatical about themselves for a while.

You actually noticing your own shortcomings is the first step - I find many ADHDers aren't introspective enough in that regard, then they end up on that bullshit redpill sub. 

I know it sounds like the usual BS, but try to acknowledge when you start zoning in or ""hyperfocusing"", and try to just be yourself. I know it takes immense energy and willpower to break that sort of cycle you describe, but it's doable, so say the legends at least...","ctozqnn",1,1438534957,"2015-08-02 17:02:37"
"5230","The people who couldn't stay in a relationship with me (friends, romantic, whatever) weren't people I needed to remain in a relationship with. It doesn't matter that they are awesome people in general. They weren't right for me or me for them. Not every connection is viable in the long term.  
   
But here's the thing. The folks who know who I am in all of my disorganized, distracted, forgetful glory and have stuck around anyway, are real and true friends who I can feel reasonably confident won't walk away just because I'm having a difficult day or week or year. There have been a lot of incredible people who have moved in and out of my life. Sometimes I'm sad that they drifted or ran away. At the same time, I have such an incredible set of friends who accept me despite of (and sometimes because of) my quirks and annoying bits. I've turned off some people, but there's not a lot I can do about that now, so I try not to dwell on it for too long (which is super hard, but worth working on).  
   
Now that you know what's going on, you can work on recognizing things you want to work on changing and things that you just don't have the energy to work on right now. That will improve your ability to cultivate relationships that can last through most of what you'll all throw at them. You will also learn to identify relationships that tend to enhance the more negative aspects of your behavior. I've met several people who I cannot be friends with, not because they aren't good people but because we tended to bring out the worst in each other. Separate, we're both great; together, not so much.  
   
Be patient with your self. Be kind. This is not a once and done kind of diagnosis. It takes hard work, but understanding yourself better will likely translate into improved relationships. You're already moving in a positive direction, and that's awesome!","gq8c4wj",2,1615224255,"2021-03-08 17:24:15"

"5244","Been on 80mg strattera since October of 2015, so several months now. The Lexapro is huge for anxiety for me, maybe not so much with depression? the reason I mention it for ADHD is that anxiety makes it much harder for me to do anything productive, I find my thoughts mostly circling around ways to get rid of the anxiety instead of completing the task at hand, which puts me further behind and increases anxiety and forms a very nasty feedback loop. 

I can definitely see the dangers with adderall, I've had addiction problems in the past which is why the doctors have pushed me to try other non-stimulant solutions first. I was mostly functional even though the ADHD was pretty obvious until my early 20s, was near the top of my class in highschool and graduated undergrad without much of an issue but had it all come apart during graduate school. Since I had this sort of pattern my psych and therapist explained that the depression/anxiety is what pushed me into the realm of problematic ADHD symptoms. So far my experience with all the various medications (strattera, lexapro, ritalin, wellbutrin, adderall, concerta, xanax... not to mention caffeine, nicotine, medical marijuana and various other illicit drugs) has led me to believe that  nothing is going to 'fix' me and suddenly make everything work better. 

I'm not sure how bad your ADHD is or what specific aspects of it you're hoping to get improvements in, but at least for me the best I'm hoping to get out of the medication is enough stability to set up a routine that lets me be a productive member of society.","czxna3r",1,1455305176,"2016-02-12 19:26:16"

If possible, I'd recommend two things:

1. Create your own expectations for yourself, even if they're different from what others expect from you. If they can't understand what you're going through, they're going to have unrealistic expectations that will hurt you to try to live up to. Your adjusted expectations could look something like: ""I'm going to try to do 80% of the assignments, not 100%"", or ""I'll attend the class but I'm not turning on my camera"", or ""If I need to talk on the phone, I will go for a walk to get away from home"", or any other accommodation that will help you. Don't try to do things ""the normal way"" just because other people think you should.
2. If your teacher seems at all reasonable or understanding, reach out and let them know you're struggling. Even a brief note, ""I'm really struggling, and I'm working on it, and am hoping to catch up"" can open a helpful dialogue.","fmcv9j9",2,1585953525,"2020-04-03 22:38:45"

Okay so this is kinda weird for me, because I have some of these symptoms as well..

I always get a ringing in my ear, usually just one ear at a time, maybe once a week or more it happens. And the rest of my hearing kind of fades out and all I can hear is the ringing for like 3-5 seconds.

Secondly, I get head rushes almost every time I stand up. Sometimes it's so bad my vision goes full-on tunnel vision and blacks out for a second. I don't black out I just can't see for a second. Usually it's not that bad but it does happen sometimes.

Lastly, I am super clumsy. I am always tripping or bumping into walls / tables or dropping things. My mom and her mom have a history of vertigo - so this is interesting!

Without medication I am not in control of my thoughts and actions, and no amount of will power can change that. Believe me, I've had decades of trying (wasn't diagnosed until my 30s). 

The medication gives back that control. It allows me to say ""actually, I need to do this thing now, even if I don't want to"", and my body and mind accept my decision and do what they're told.

As for medication, I'm sure you'll learn that the usual adhd stimulants are far from perfect for some of us adhd'ers.

It only occurs to me that these feelings can sometimes serve a useful purpose e.g. in the case of fear, guiding a decision not to do something; in the case of anger guiding a decision not to let someone else exploit you.

Ich hatte gerade vorvergangene Woche alle möglichen Psychiater abtelefoniert um möglichst schnell einen Termin zu bekommen. Der Hintergrund ist bei mir, dass ich mein Studium sehr stark gefährdet sehe und an mangelnder Intelligenz scheitert es nicht.
Ich wohne allerdings in Berlin, also gibt es auch genug Psychiater um schnell an einen Termin zu kommen.

Jedenfalls... ich hatte also zufällig innerhalb einer Woche einen Termin bei einem gewöhnlichen Psychiater bekommen. Immerhin! Allerdings war dieser eher unterirdisch und hatte quasi innerhalb von 10 Minuten komplett zu wissen geglaubt, wer ich bin und wo mein Problem liegt und wollte mich dann in eine reine Verhaltenstherapie bei einem Psychiater abschieben. (Letzteres ist sicher obendrein sehr sinnvoll, aber ich vermute mal, dass eine medikamentöse Behandlung bei mir von Nöten sein wird, falls/wenn ADHS dann bei mir diagnostiziert wird).
Ich bin dann frustriert zu einem Krankenhaus gegangen von dem ich schon gehört habe, dass es da eine Psychiaterin gibt, die sich u.a. auf ADHS bei Erwachsenen spezialisiert hat und einen Termin habe ich da für den 20.2. bekommen. Ich finde es also sehr krass, dass du da so lange warten musst... Falls es bei dir also auch dringend sein sollte, wäre doch zu erwägen, noch woanders einen Termin zu bekommen.

Eating something will help a crash immensely. If you're crashing harder than you think you should, try taking less of the medication. And call your doctor with your thoughts on this.

"5393","My fourth semester I failed everything. (This was the same semester I was diagnosed with ADHD, and started treatment.) I then switched majors and transferred to another school. I did okay for awhile, then two years later I had another semester where I failed everything. (Medication was working fine, but I hadn't figured out all the strategies I needed in order to be successful.)

I switched majors and transferred again. Two years later, I graduated with my bachelor's degree in mathematics. It took six years, and three schools. I had a 3.69 GPA in my last two years.

Three years after that, I got my Master's degree in mathematics, with a 3.86 GPA. After my first semester, I was selected to teach a class as part of an assistantship, so I ended up getting paid to get my Master's.

Biggest lesson I learned is that failing isn't the end of the world. You get back up, and you try a different approach. And you just keep adjusting your strategies/techniques, figuring out what works for you and what doesn't, knowing that *you're different*, and so you can't just use the approach that works for someone else and expect it to work for you.","d9l6ge2",3,1478241424,"2016-11-04 06:37:04"

"5398","Honestly one of my best friends is like this. She was diagnosed when she was late 30’s. She is determined to be mad at someone all the time. It’s never her and it’s always someone else doing something to her. It’s getting really hard to be her friend because I have enough issues I’m dealing with. She wants me to be there for her but she’s always negative and hasn’t for years seemed to care about me and my stuff. I don’t know what to do because no matter how I explain it to her she is determined to make it my fault. Uggh. Not only that she is super mean to me at times! I’m not her emotional doormat and yet she acts as if I should be! She’s making it impossible to have any normal conversation.

To her credit I am not as available anymore for various reasons. However in all honesty why should I be available when someone is trying to push and push and escalate things so she can have her dose of drama that she needs and to treat me badly? 

She writes me a message and I respond but she doesn’t read anything I say and instead gets all self involved and mean again. It makes no sense. Then she apologizes and says we both need to calm down? Ok...

She says we haven’t spoken in a year and yet I have electronic proof that isn’t the case! No reasoning works with her.

What the hell am I supposed to do with that? I need advice. We have known each other for over 10 years but she acts like she doesn’t know me; that’s the worse thing about it.

By the time I started meds, I was so old (23-ish) that by that time, my parents were finally starting to get it. Now they're surprisingly cool about it (my mom has even realized that she, my dad, and my sister probably all have it and is even trying meds -- she's about to turn 60). But my entire life, they were my harshest critics, because they could see themselves in me and it hurt like hell. (As an aside, I'm having a similar experience now with a professor of mine who very CLEARLY suffers from ADHD. He has started to notice my symptoms and has been really harsh about calling me out whenever I ""do something wrong"")

This video came out recently-ish and it hit really close to home:
https://youtu.be/rD9qK8-sMGQ

My point is, try to combat the doubt whenever you can. It can hurt you just as much as your actual symptoms sometimes. Go out and look at all the literature, all the studies -- often, that's what it takes for me to ""show"" myself that this is not just in my head.

"5414","We cannot and will not diagnose anyone.  You need to speak with a trained professional to determine if you have ADHD or not.  Read the [Wiki page on the Diagnosis Process](https://np.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/diagnosis) for more information on finding a doctor and other steps.

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

My number 1 advice is take advantage of academic accommodations if you have them available.  At my school people with anxiety or attention disorders got extra hours and a quiet isolated room for exams.  I regret not using that to help.  As for what you should be doing in school, I can only speak from I wish I had done more.  Get involved in team projects that you would want to be able to share in a future job interview.  Don't beat yourself up for procrastination or having a hard time focusing on what you should be focusing on.  Do your best to set up some kind of system that works for you to get the important tasks done.  Prioritize the most important things first,  extreme example -&gt; like not spending 10 hours for a perfect homework grade in a 1 credit course when you got a huge exam(30% of grade) for a 3 credit course coming up soon.","g8q3r66",1,1602618884,"2020-10-13 19:54:44"

"5449","I think a few people have already said this, but as an individual with a keen interest in neurochemistry of our disease, I can say this. We have a dopamine imbalance, in our heads that fails to reward stimuli. Failure to reward results in a lack of focus, we start seeking somewhat ""normal"" extremes to gain reward, which basically are our symptoms. 

Now with every drug comes an chance for inherent abuse. Now the meds we take basically help us regulate dopamine in the brain. Different drugs have different ways of creating a somewhat excess of it, so that we can function like normal human beings because ADHD'd minds have a deficiency of dopamine (ie: concerta blocks the re-uptake of dopamine so it stays longer in our system). 

Excess dopamine can cause some of the things mentioned on that thread, but lets face it that thread was meant for junkies, so they know when to bail out on the drug their abusing before the negative effects counteract the positive high their chasing. My question to you is are you a junkie? If so, be worried, and stop taking meds. 

But if you got prescribed meds after the the insane process of getting diagnosed and screened out as an abuser, then take solace in that fact. Because doctors have essentially cleared the fact that your expressing a deficiency and need to counteract it. And through multiple drug trials and paper reviews and long term research, it has been found that these drugs do no harm to a deficient mind, and hence you only get the positive parts of your drug. (Barring drug side effects of-course.)

Sorry for the wall of text, I think the only way you can come to terms with your medication is through the cold hard scientific truth. If your meds work for you then take them knowing that for you specifically they are doing a lot more good than any harm. ","chb8brb",1,1399408301,"2014-05-06 20:31:41"

1. Yes your breathing patterns do greatly affect your cognitive abilities. Sleep patterns are also impacted by your breathing or lack thereof.  It would be worthwhile to see an Ear,Nose, and Throat doctor.  

2. Vyvanse is lysine bound to d-amphetamine salt.. It gets broken down **fully** by the body several hours after ingesting. You could be feeling this drop once the drug has been metabolized.  

3. Circadian Rhythm - Body works on endless cycles of restoring energy and disposing of waste..  Taking an amphetamine can denormalize these processes and cause a cascade of issues.  Eventually disrupting cognition.

The easiest solution would be to ask your doctor for 5-10mg of Adderall IR for when the vyvanse wears off.

What I've found is that I have to pick my battles. If its something that is going to be detrimental to the family or our business if it gets forgotten, then I go into ultra-reminder mode. Post-its, Google calendar with multiple notifications,  kitchen notice board, gentle texts, in-person reminders etc. Sometimes I'll even get the initial steps of an item started then let him take over once its nudged his 'start button', so to speak. If none of this helps, I'll do it myself and we will have a discussion after the fact. 

For all other things, I just let it go and enjoy the uniqueness that is the ADHD character.  I've learned that 99% of the time there is no malice behind the inaction. Its a combination of being distracted by minutiae of a task, finding something else more interesting, difficulty focusing for long periods (eg taxes?), and plain forgetfulness. 

If you can't see yourself being able to discern between the critical vs important vs nice-to-have, then you should discuss that with him now. Unless he also feels that coaching/medication would help him, I wouldn't go pushing it on him trying to get him to change to meet your needs.

The Wellbutrin and Adderall both work on dopamine system so now that I’m only using the one med it’s not as effective.

For my own meds to work best I find these factors most important to stay on top of:
-Sleep (brain fatigue means neurotransmitters are less effective overall)
-Proper nutrition (meds are broken down in stomach/gut and neurotransmitters start being made in the gut, if digestive system is not healthy then the meds aren’t going to be broken down and used properly)
-Avoiding or significantly limiting simple carbs/sugar (sugar is the quickest hit of dopamine you can get, but it’s also addictive and wreaks havoc)

I think a lot of people with ADHD have an easy time retaining actual information, which is where you get the ""smart but doesn't apply themself"" thing we see with a lot of people with ADHD.

"5542","This post has been removed because we cannot help anyone approach their doctor to secure diagnosis and medication.  While no judgements are being made about you and your intentions, the fact is that too many people try to use ADHD groups as guidance to acquire these medications for recreational or otherwise illicit usage.  

Usually the best course of action involves being totally honest with your doctor about the issues that you experience in your life.  If you have trouble remembering them or suspect you will have trouble remembering them in the meeting with your doctor, it is suggested to write them down over time as you experience them.  Compile that list and bring it with you to the appointment.  If you lose track or forget what you were going to say, you can look down at the paper and read off of it.  

Many ADHD symptoms may also be caused my other disorders (anxiety, depression, and bipolar are just a few examples). A doctor trying to rule out other disorders is just trying to get to the bottom of the issue. It's not bad or wrong to see if it's something else first. 

There is also the concern that there is no possible way anyone here can determine how any doctor will react to anything you say to them.  Will they see self-medication (just as an example) as supporting evidence?  Maybe.  Will they see you as a druggy because of your self-medication?  Maybe.  There is no way for us to predict this, and thus any advice we give could very well be ""wrong.""  This stems from the fact that there is not yet a standardized evaluation for ADHD.  

If you would like to discuss evaluation related _anxiety_, please post a separate topic requesting support for that.

Basically, it's about taking a specific moment to tune in with what's happening in your body and mind throughout the day. It only takes a moment.

"5594","hi there!! my SO has ADHD and he misplaces his airpods in the house at least 3x a day. He either misplaces the case itself or forget where he put the actual airpods, so most of the time they're never charged when he needs to use them. I have ADHD as well, so there would be many occasions where we would have airpods all over the floor and we'd always get them mixed up, or use the other person's case instead of finding where we misplaced it. To try to fix this, my SO and I work on **recognizing** where we like to place them and **actively work** **to place them in a spot where we can see and remember them**. 

It seems like you have a couple locations (home &amp; work) where you might be more prone to losing or misplacing them. I also lose things ALL the time, so I definitely understand your frustration. Do you have a **mental checklist** before you leave work? *okay. what am i forgetting? wallet, keys, airpods, backpack?* 

If you're considering a new pair, maybe think about **where** you were most likely to lose them before**.** When you use or place your airpods somewhere outside of your home, maybe put a **sticky note reminder** where you're 100% sure you have to look before you leave--maybe your keys or backpack? or possibly a note on the dashboard on your car/bike? 

There's no need to apologize, I think most people on here also experience how you're feeling right now, so don't feel sorry about expressing your emotions. Something that I've been working to challenge my self-deprecating thoughts and feeling broken, is to recognize that ADHD is no joke. It's tough. There are days when I barely have enough energy to get out of bed to go to the bathroom. There are times when I get frustrated that I spend weeks agonizing about something that ended up taking 5 minutes to do. It's hard, I get it. ADHD is something that we all have, and it's difficult feeling like you're never going to get better.

Some things I've been working on is being nicer to myself. When I have similar thoughts, I stop and imagine if I were giving advice to a friend. If they were struggling with something, would you tell them that they're worthless or that they're never capable of changing? I can only assume you would rather encourage and support them, recognize their feelings are valid, and try to help them see places where they can improve. 

I still have a hard time accepting my ADHD, and I genuinely don't know if I ever will. I like to take time at the end of every week to recognize the things I'm proud of, even if it seems stupid, like congratulating myself for showering or brushing my teeth for the first time in 4 days. I also write down things that didn't quite work for me, and ask myself if there are other methods that can help me towards my goals.

I can fully understand the desire to do so much and the guilt of not finishing most any of it (much less anything you're 'supposed' to be doing). And I personally don't have many personal projects, but I feel like i'll reach the point when I fear I won't have the energy to do any as I get older and busier.

I wish I had more advice to give, but I guess i'll comment as if looking at this in reverse. You may not be where you want and you may not be able to do everything you want, but clearly, you're learning so much and doing far more with what you have than most. You may feel guilty for not finishing your work, but always feel proud that you 'started' so, so many times. For many, starting was the most intimidating part. And i'm sure it still is for you at times when you see something you know you don't have the time to commit to. But regardless, you did start and have done a lot of things. 

I can only hope that you'll end up somewhere better but I can hope that needless desire to create will stay with you through it all. It's difficult to handle at times but it's special and it's in good hands all things considered.","gbwj4xn",2,1605067250,"2020-11-11 04:00:50"

Only SNRI i have been on was Effexor. It worked for a while on the depression but I dont recall it doing a thing for the ADHD (it didnt make it worse either though). I somehow grew tolerant of it and increasing the dose to the max level did nothing.

And at least get the depression addressed medication-wise. 

At 12 years old I was told I had MDD and SAD. Sounds similar to your experience even though I was luckily in a nice comfy big room alone with a psychologist and my mom waited in waiting room. The psych was nice and kind, and that's when I got my first referral to a psychiatrist. 

I wouldn't get diagnosed with GAD until I made a suicide plan at 20 and got hospitalized/super embarrassed. A few days after getting out of hospital I turned 21 and it was a perfect storm of alcohol, parties, and boys. 

Now at 23 I got told I have panic disorder, and that got me my Xanax Rx, and at 24 FINALLY my inattentiveness got so erratic and disturbing my psychiatrist had an ""aha"" moment. 

Sure enough I scored super highly on the self-report rating scales. It had to get to the point where I would open a book and immediately yawn, feel angry, and stare at the first few words for like 30 minutes until I was so PO'ed I gave up. This was particularly shocking bc at the time I was still finishing my bachelors in ENGLISH and I have always been a bookworm, but lately I have lost that side to me. Thankfully w/ stims and benzos I'm slowwwwly getting back to my ""old self""- at least the parts I liked. 


Sorry super long post but in short, please hang in there; my hope is that you see my progression getting worse and worse and I could have prevented this all way back at 12 years old. 

I also have negative relationships with my parents - if there's any part of them that empathizes with you on any part try and build on what they support. Ex. My mom would have never listened to me talk about anxiety or ADHD but she knew about depression because she had it and could relate. So at least using that to get my foot in the door and to have a parents support is wonderful. Not saying to be manipulative, but in some way get a parent or other close/authorized relative to get on board on SOME level. Once you're in the doc's office alone then you can describe your symptoms (emphasize what's been dismissed before?) but let the doc come to the conclusion.

Regarding your parents - you're an adult. Their involvement in this matter is restricted to being funding via access to their insurance.

Also! If you can induce some kind of hyper-focus state that works great! For me, I just need to see it written out on a page and decide to start, even for just 10 minutes.

"5682","It’s all about building habits. I can’t just will myself into being organized, but if I very slowly incorporate it into my daily routine then it’s easier to grasp for myself personally. Microsoft Office’s To-Do list and calendar essentially rule my life. I like to put all of my constants/ strict deadlines on my calendar and will use my To-Do list to track whatever pops into my head so if I do get distracted before finishing I can remember that it still needs to get done. I also carry a small legal pad around so that I can write down thoughts if I’m in the middle of a project. Otherwise, I get wrapped up and forget what I was going on about so it’s nice to keep a record of it to keep things more linear.  It doesn’t help very much for planning though because I’m not great at formatting and it gets jumbled pretty quickly/ I don’t go back to look at what I write. That’s what’s great about Microsoft Office’s To-Do list though, it has a fairly strict format built in and it makes a very gratifying “Ding” when you check something off. Highly recommend. 

Just don’t try to organize your entire life in one sitting and just start keeping track of some of the big things at first. Make a designated time in your day where you check your calendar. I personally have a second (Less aggressive sounding) alarm on my phone set for 15 minutes after I wake up to remind me to check my calendar. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it has really helped me.

I also have the calendar synced to my phone, Microsoft Teams, and my email so almost all of my work stuff gets automatically synced when people send out the meeting invites and I can look at it easily using my phone.","gd3jvra",2,1605987519,"2020-11-21 19:38:39"

"5687","Thank you so much! This was really helpful and encouraging. My dream for years has been to specialize in neurology (although I have other areas I'd consider specializing in too) so hearing that it's more detail-oriented and slower paced sounds perfect. I'd heard that the pace was very different from the standard in small animal clinics. That being said, I do enjoy the variety in general practice so I'm sure I would still enjoy it even if I find it a little too fast paced. But what you said about specializations is very very encouraging. 

As for school, in Canada we only have 5 schools of veterinary medicine. I'm in Ontario so OVC is my only option. Unfortunately clinical rotations are only in fourth year but to my knowledge, there is a good amount of hands on learning in anatomy, pathology and clinical labs etc. I have a friend going into her fourth year and she had told me about some of the hands on learning she did in her first and second years. It sounded like so much fun haha. Hard as hell, but fun. 

I know school will be grueling but I think I'll be okay overall. I was a very good student in the past. I'll have to rebuild my good study habits because I've let them slide with grad school and the pandemic. 

That's also a very good point. My ability to take notes quickly, maintain attention for long periods of studying and during lectures won't reflect my ability to diagnose and treat illnesses or my ability to communicate with clients. My only problem may be taking notes during appointments but I figure I could probably just dictate my notes during the appointment then clean them up afterward. I coped with ADHD on my own until I was 19 (suspected as a 6 or 7yr old but mother refused to screen me because she didn't want me medicated) so I'm sure I can figure out ways to work around my weak points while emphasizing my strengths. Do you have any tips for coping with symptoms of adhd in clinic? 

I've heard that piece of advice from your mentor before. It's good advice. I can say with some degree of certainty that I can't see myself doing anything else and being happier. Sure, I've had people suggest I go into law and I've considered it. I think that I could do well in law but I just don't see myself being happier than I would be in veterinary medicine. Veterinary medicine is really the only career I've ever felt truly motivated towards. I'm very passionate about medicine and I love working with animals (I mean who doesn't?). When I was considering research as a career because I was doing well at it, I was noticeably less motivated than before because I didn't really know what I wanted to do with a PhD. The jobs just didn't excite me the same way as vet med. So yeah, I can see myself doing well in other fields but I don't see myself enjoying the work as much and thus I can't see myself being happier than if I were in veterinary medicine. I guess the tricky part is emotions can be hard to predict but I just have to trust that I know myself and be confident in my decision-making which has been good in the past.

Yes, there is controversy because a treatment option void of medication and surgery takes money away from optometrist and ophthalmologist.
However calling it a pseudoscience is erroneous. The Behavioral Optometrist that I work for spent an additional 4 years in optometry school to be able to administer therapy. She does far more in depth testing than any ophthalmologist or optometrist you would come across in your average vision center. I have data supporting the efficacy of vision therapy for every last one of my patients.

I am a skeptic by nature. I have a very low tolerance for snake oil type treatments however since I became a vision therapist 3 years ago I have seen a 46 year old man gain depth perception for the first time in his life and get his job back.

**Warning if you have not finished the show House MD there are spoilers in the below link for seasons such as 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc.**  *They are in passing and not focused on* **but your brain will notice them.** So if you are not comfortable with this you have been warned.

&amp;nbsp;

* Two short youtube videos **[Everybody Lies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru4FtqeLf9Y)** and **[Not Okay]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKW0Ba79zwA)**

&amp;nbsp;

Gregory House in the show House MD is a person with Undiagnosed ADHD.  At some artificial outsider perspective level he looks to be high functioning ADHD.  He graduated medical school, he has a prestigious job and is recognized as the expert in his specialty, he has tenure so it is very hard to lose his job security.

But in the end though due to his Undiagnosed ADHD he suffers many impairments.

* He has a substance abuse problem which is by far the most severe problem in his life, more so than his undiagnosed ADHD. But his substance abuse really is a mask to the bigger problem

* His bigger problem is he has no self-respect for himself, he thinks of himself as broken, and he ruminates on how he is broken and he won’t let himself get off these thoughts.  He is **compelled** to always come back to thinking he is broken as if he had a **compulsion.**  This is actually evidence of a brain problem, not like you are brain damage but like you are depressed and have certain compulsive thoughts.  It is a very common comorbidity to ADHD and other disorders.  House in the end because he can’t shake the feeling broken compulsion self-medicates the problem away with opioids.  Opiods block physical pain but also emotional pain caused by nonphysical sources such as self-brain inflicted pain designed to cause change.  Now these feelings of regret and shame can become pathological and so debilitating they are impairment and not a help and they can lead to things such as depression, anxiety, self-destructive behavior, etc.

* He only has one friend who will put up with him.  Even though numerous people love him, he drives them all away.

* House has only one long term relationship.  In the end he self-sabotages the relationship.  He wants to forgive the person, this is his biggest goal, but in the end he still self-destructs the relationship until she leaves him.

* He was kicked out of medical school (John Hopkins) due to cheating.  He was cheating not because he was not intelligent but because he did not have the willpower to study and do boring things.  He barely got admitted to another university (University of Michigan).

* House is given multiple opportunities to not go to Jail or phase serious consequences such as the loss of his job but House always screws them up due to impulsivity issues.  He knows he should not act this way, he does not want to act this way, but in the end he does act this way.

* House is not financially secure, even though he makes enough money from his job that it can be easy to be financial secure.  House also does not have many expensive hobbies and such.  Yet he is not financially secure due to impulsivity.

* House has a self-control problem when it comes to his mouth.  Now he is mostly an ass because he chooses to be (finds it fun, he finds it morally the superior option the truth no matter how hurtful, he does it to push people away for he is not comfortable around other people) but House has also said many things without thinking that hurt people he cares about or is not in his short term let alone long term interest.

* Un-functional family arrangements with his parents (that said I sympathize and I have made a similar choice due to similar circumstances)

* Several automobile accidents

* Suicide attempts.

* He can't do his job.  He can't do the clinic duty for he finds it to be too tedious, boring and uninteresting/unnovel/unstimulating.  He can't do the medical tests, sure he has a staff but if he did not have the staff if his environment was slightly change he would be far more disabled.

* He is a creature of habit to such an extreme degree he can not tolerate any change such as losing a sentimental item for it makes him feel comfortable.  It helps him think and reflect.

* He can't stand being bored, he must always find an occupation for his time whether it is tv, game boy, or setting the hospital on fire for fire in the hospital is at least interesting and god damn the consequences for interesting is far more important than consequences.

I think that is enough, you get the point.

**House is not sick, he is not broken, he does not have a disease;** yet he suffers impairments in his life that are needless and can be corrected we call this a disorder. House's problems are chronic enough to be pathological impairments. There are two definitions of the word pathological according to Merriam Webster.  .  Pathological:  1) Relating to Disease or 2) Being to such a degree of extreme, excessive, or markedly abnormal.  House situation is the second one.  If you believe your husband is the same way then you need to help him understand the difference and how getting medication or therapy is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength.  It is like how we take heart medication.  You may do so to prevent a problem if you have a past personal history of a heart problem but also we do it now at certain ages if you have a genetic history of heart problems and it is likely you will have heart problems in the future.  Medicine is not just restorative it is also preventative.

I'm not sure how to combat this, besides the obvious realization that a disorder you have doesn't make you stupid, in fact you may have a very high iq (even though I accept it doesn't completely dictate how intelligent someone is, just a good reference point) and be ADHD and seem slow to others because of all the banter in your head making it hard for you to process and key in on any given idea or subject. I feel like these types of people mistake the average ADHD person and someone stupid and easily manipulated, because often times people who have to think an extra 5 second about something ARE less intelligent.

Also, if you could see any mental health professional during this process, it may help, because there's a possibility that mood, trauma, or something else is also contributing to your focus issues, and perhaps the treatment for those are more within reach. For example, a number of people with ADHD have depression, and treating the depression can help alleviate the ADHD. And sometimes other disorders can look like ADHD, so it might help to undergo other evaluations, if you can have them done sooner.

That being said, I am thankful for having been medicated in the past because it allowed me to see all the things I was missing and learn ways to compensate. I had to relearn a lot of those things again when I stopped medication, but before I didn't even know they existed. It really is a personal choice. There are circumstances in which I would take medication again. I try to avoid professional situations in which that would be necessary, but that is also limiting. It is all a give and take.

Look into CBT and cognitive distortions, and see if you can reframe your thoughts about your diagnosis in a way that serves you better.

After I was diagnosed, it took another three months to get my medication appointment, and then a month later everything stalled again because I was supposed to see a cardiologist (in my opinion, that was unnecessary), who then took an additional five months to confirm that there is no reason I shouldn't be medicated (I think they lost track of my paperwork), and then there was an error on my prescription that caused another delay of a month. But, eventually, I did get to a point where all I need to do is request that my GP sends the pharmacy my prescription. I never regretted being diagnosed during that time.

"5752","Your link didn't work, but by chance is this the article you were trying to link to?:  http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyt.2014.00100/full.  

If so, perhaps you and I are simply arguing over semantics, but let me point out that in the very first paragraph, it becomes clear that ""autism spectrum disorder"" actually encompasses many different things, biologically.  It says they are heterogeneous, it calls them disorderS, it says they don't currently have useful biomarkerS, but that every day they are identifying new POTENTIAL biomarkerS.  

Yes, they have identified relevant genes, but there are huge numbers of DIFFERENT ones.  Those individuals do not all in fact have the same kinds of problems.

meanwhile, if you look at symptomology, you will see that yet again, there is wide variation.

further, if you look at any particular sort of symptom, you will find other individuals who do not qualify for an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, but who share that particular symptom.  You can find people with stereotypical behaviors, with OCD type issues, with speech delays, with motor problems, with social delays, and so on, but who don't have enough of a CLUSTER of all of these sorts of issues to get the diagnosis.

So the decision to draw a circle around this particular cluster of symptoms and give them a name was a social decision, and I don't believe it's clearly backed by science.  In other words, the choice to categorize people in that particular way.

It's like looking at a parking lot and picking out the cars that are all Fords, red, have dents in the door, cracked headlights, and leaking oil, and calling them schmootzenhertzels.  I'll bet you could find a whole bunch of schmootzenhetzels, but why did you leave out the orange ones?  the ones with no dents?  the ones not leaking oil?  and so on.   

Taking the cluster of issues and calling it a specific syndrome is the part I question, because it can distort potentially useful information.

Like the fact which is OBVIOUS in my particular family, that at least part of my autistic son's symptoms, if not all of them, are coming from the precise same underlying biology that has given the rest of us ADHD.  The line between adhd and autism is very, very, very blurry in this household.  

And that's how I knew.  And if I'd had any doubts then, they totally disappeared while watching the crazy mess that unfolded while they revised the DSM.  

and the way the doctors can't help you complete the questionnaires, which do in fact turn on whether this or that happens ""too much.""  Well, how is that not subjective??

Most of the problems in my household disappear when we aren't trying to blend in with the rest of society.  So that part of it is obviously social also.  A problem that is only a problem when you get compared to other people, or is actually only a problem FOR THEM, is also obviously social.

If you ask my son, I promise you he will tell there is nothing ""wrong"" with him.  And there's NOT.

A difference is not a disease.

There's a reason why it is this way. Stims work differently for our brains. Many people who take stim medication report they can fall asleep easier and sleep better when taking stims at night.

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

Lol it was a miracle that I was polite to her... usually my emotional impulsiveness doesn't have any breaks and my ADHD temper without any breaks comes out, if you know what I mean.  :o  I can be quite sarcastic / sassy! But the upside of my ADHD is that after I get so worked up about it, I eventually forget it completely lol and I don't ever hold grudges because I'm too distracted by everything else going on in my life.  Is it the same with you?  Were the unpleasant situations you mentioned also ADHD-related awkwardness thrust upon you?   What's the worse ADHD-related situation you've ever been in?  (Of course of it's too personal to disclose, I don't want you to tell me). 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to deal with her again, so I think I'll just talk to someone in the student disabilities office that is higher up than she is.  I'll try to tell them I acknowledge I don't have any physical evidence of my experience with her, but both my father and boyfriend witnessed me afterwards being worked up and crying about it.  So I do have witnesses as well.  Do you think they'll believe me and keep an eye on her and talk to her?  (Though I think talking to her might make things worse, because I totally could see her becoming even more bitchy).  I honestly want to tell them that if she is like this with every other student, she is definitely incompetent for the job and they could easily find someone who is better suited for it.  (After all, she's very sure of her competency, so I'm sure she can *easily* find another job if she is let go of \*eye rolls\*).

"5813","Diagnosed as adult here.

Childhood was amazing: short and easy lessons, lots of play outside, little decisions to make, structured time, talents yielding achievements and building self-esteem,... Good days. :) 

I started having problems in middle school. Before that, I can only note some daydreaming and doing my homework very quickly and messily.

&gt; I was bored with the level of books

Was your boredom noticeable? Low boredom tolerance? Novelty-seeking?

&gt; 'girls' can have more subtle symptoms during childhood

The thing is it's kids who cause trouble that are noticed. Girls tend to be less hyperactive and more into daydreaming, playing with their hair, stuff like that. 

Did you have a messy room? Did you lose things? Were you excitable? Easily angry? Did you look for trouble? Act impulsively? Now all these things are typical of childhood, and while a person with ADHD may experience them to a bigger extent, a gifted child may be coping well and none of these would grow to a problematic scale. But if these things persisted in you until adulthood, they may be worth noting.

Hope this helps. :)

Im sorry if this is really not very helpful. I find that when I’m stuck like this the only thing that helps me is a lot of positive fixation to try and adjust how I feel about the task. And just think that in 2 days you will never have to look at that task again! For these last minute school deadlines i only got through by doing the bare minimum required and just suffering through it unfortunately. Good luck i hope you can get it done!","geatpwo",1,1606857647,"2020-12-01 21:20:47"

And by the way concerta is a great treatment, sadly I might have to change due to side effects but I was completely different while on the correct dosage for me, I was able to do everything I always wanted to like work and not think about everything I wanted to do instead of my work, good luck with our lovely NHS and hope all things go well.

But that is my real name, yes. And all I can say is that you may not know what you’re striving for right now, but that doesn’t mean you should stop being the best version of you that you can be. Whether you realize it or not, the struggles you are going through right now are preparing you for happiness and success. For instance, I struggled for a long time being the “nice girl” that finished last, and working my ass off only to feel like it never paid off. I’ve been through a lot, which I won’t get into here. But one day I stumbled upon a career that I fell in love with...and suddenly it all made sense. The heartbreak, the struggle, sleepless nights. Everything I fought through made me better, made me who I am, and made me the perfect fit for my career/purpose.

"5847","I'm 23 and she's 22. Yeah, it drives her nuts when I can't switch off and she just wants to lie on the couch and cuddle. Or when she needs to sleep and I can't stop drowning in clickbait lists. Basically it's a bit of both. Sometimes I just have to force myself to lie down or sit with her; sometimes I set a timer, so I can give myself an out. Other times, I just have to explain that I'm buzzed - I'll sit on the other side of the room or go for a walk or something, to give her time alone.  

We have an unspoken deal that we both get time to hibernate when we need it. It's as simple as her saying ""I'm low and I need to cuddle on the couch"" or me coming home from an intense day at work and saying ""I need to lock myself in the bedroom alone and just let my brain run freely"".   

On the idea of ""fill in what you're lacking"", I find that it's way easier to  do practical things to help when she's down, than try to stay in bed with her or cuddle and talk (although I try to do those things): this is a list I just saw of ideas http://sassygaynicoo.tumblr.com/post/115857024840/super-nice-things-to-do-for-someone-who-has  

Big ones for me are cleaning, cooking, washing clothes - I know she likes having the house neat (because of the anxiety) but struggles to keep that up.

"5867","Psychiatrist here. Having compled both undergraduate, and doctorate degrees, and taken numerous board certification exams, I know a thing or two about studying with ADHD.  

Here are my best tips: 
1. Approach studying the same way an Olympic athlete approaches their sport. Each study session is like a practice session. Study with purpose. Figure out what you need to work on the most and do that first.  Never just open a book and start reading without intentionality. 

2.  Focus on what you don't know and avoid the trap of reviewing what you already know. This is harder than it sounds. Practice tests and group studying are great ways to learn what you don't know. Make it your intention to learn these things. 

3. Use different techniques for different situations. If the material is abstract and conceptual, make concept maps (mind maps). If it's rote memorization, use flashcards. If it's visual, make your own drawings. If it's formula based, then practice questions.  

4. Concept maps are genius. They force you to figure out how integrate the big picture stuff with details. Learn it. Love it. 

5. When doing practice questions, when you get something wrong, understand what the exact problem is so you don't make that mistake again. Don't just ""memorize"" the correct answer and move on.  If youre really stumped ask the teacher. 

6. Group studying is a drag for so many reasons but it also helps for so many reasons. 

7. Learn test taking skills. This is especially true for multiple choice. Sometimes you can eliminate answers with minimal subject knowledge simply by eliminating choices that are illogical. 

8. (Optional) Dress up for exam day. Put on nice clothes, organize your belongings. Use crisp new #2 pencils.  Treat it like you are the star of the performance. 

9. If given the option, go to live class rather than watching online. It forces you to be more present. Turn off the computer if they're distractions. Take notes in your own writing, even if it's already there in PowerPoint. It forces you to think about what you're doing and it will help you figure out what's most important later on.

"5900","I saw a video discussing the 'anxious ADHD type', which sounds like you (the video is behind a paywall now, so I can't link it). 

The summary is that for some people the ADHD is bothersome, but their anxiety about looking like a functioning adult/not disappointing people overwrites it by providing loads of stress hormones that kick them into action. 

This could make it *look* like your ADHD is pretty mild, because you get (some) things done, but it doesn't take into account that getting those things done is raising your anxiety way beyond normal levels (and slowly but steadily chips away at your overall mental health).

I know you didn't ask, but if you can you might want to try some different ADHD medications as well, the one you're taking is usually only prescribed for ADHD if there's a specific reason not to use something amphetamine based (unless there is a reason not to take those of course). So there's a chance something else might do even more to help you with your ADHD based problems. 

I got diagnosed with depression/anxiety years before I discovered that those were being caused by ADHD. When I finally got diagnosed with ADHD and started treating that I was amazed about how much calmer it made me. 

Like before I did learn how to deal with forgetting things and how to forgive myself etc, but it turns out that 'simply' not forgetting the thing in the first place is calming on a level I forgot existed.","euft5ly",3,1563789800,"2019-07-22 10:03:20"

"5904","I've always been ""quirky,"" I had a lot of friends but never felt super connected to anyone of that makes sense. In my lower moments I figured my friends saw me as sort of a mascot, fun to have around but not an equal (I'm not sure that's an entirely fair assessment, but it's the best I can do). 

I was only diagnosed a few years ago, but I have suspected I had ADHD since grad school (about 10 years). I'm generally pretty self aware, but sometimes there are just too many pieces missing to make sense of things without a formal diagnosis, plus, you know, for most of my life i thought everyone had a brain that worked like mine and just coped better.

My husband has always been very understanding, and I think he always felt like my good points outweighed my extremely annoying points. The biggest change for him was when his company hired a coworker with ADHD... he sees a LOT of my behaviors and mannerism mirrored in this guy and it helped him realize that it wasn't just an excuse or me being obnoxious. So I guess at that point he transitioned from tolerant to understanding, which has helped a lot in our conversations about things. 

Being a woman is probably part of why I was never diagnosed as a child... I was more a chatterbox than bouncing off the walls (though I've always been a figeter) and while I got in trouble for talking out of turn pretty often I was otherwise not super disruptive. As an adult I'm not sure how much difference it makes... I think women are more likely to be primarily inattentive, but I'm combined type. I guess one difference is I've never been drawn to risky behavior, my impulsivity manifests more in things like buying 10 jars of spaghetti sauce when we only need 1 and and only have room for 3 or 4 (I do this all the damn time even though I ought to know better by now). So I'm not sure. I'm a stay at home mom and I think some of the problems and gender differences might be more apparent in an office or other workplace. ","cr9197v",2,1431622159,"2015-05-14 16:49:19"

Being careful and methodical about things is a powerful coping mechanism for us at times, but it can really get in the way and overwhelm us at others. 

Another commentor below asked how to keep from losing momentum. I'm going to answer that here, because it's related to the above.

When you start losing momentum, it's time to stop judging *yourself* for not being able to push against gravity, and instead start judging *the incline you are working against*. 

If you're losing momentum, it means you're trying to roll uphill, and you need to change tactics - make the process simpler, and just do *anything*. 

Same if a project is getting ahead of you and a very simple thing is now huge and unweildy - you're project is rolling downhill and snowballing, and you should maybe give up chasing it and start over, with more planning this time.","dkvx7ge",2,1501338616,"2017-07-29 14:30:16"

Write down as much as you can about what you do and how you feel. It’ll help sort things out that are just buzzing around in your head and make time with a psychiatrist more efficient.   


Listen to everything they say—they are well trained and well intentioned. But, they are also human and may not see your situation as you do or as you feel you need them to. It will take some time to be fully understood. Psychiatrists also have their own biases about patients. Ask them about their background and their specialties. Someone who specializes in ADHD is more likely to diagnose it in a patient—rightly or wrongly.

"5947","Honestly, I’m 34 and when I was in school my parents pretty much said I didn’t have anything, ignored every teacher or doctor who said I might have had ADHD, and basically refused to let me be yet another statistic in the 90’s about giving kids pills. 

Fast forward many years, even after telling all my parents, only one even asked how medication was going. I won’t go into too many details, but this disorder isn’t respected enough and still has a lot of stigma left to shake off. 

I’m on my first week of medication, which doesn’t feel like the correct strength dosage yet, but there’s *something* tangible occurring. 

Don’t worry too much about your internal self reflection, there’s a good chance you won’t actually reflect on your past and instead will just get frustrated and irritated by going over past situations that heavily affected you. At least when I first started doing that, I noticed those internal responses. Now this may not carry over directly for you, but it’s all I can offer from my personal experience, and I hope perhaps you find some assistance somewhere within. 

I started off trying to look back, reevaluate the situation see what I fucked up on in the moment. Nah, I just ended up reliving past traumas, and made things worse for myself each time I’d go back. It wasn’t until I had reached what felt like a true depth of failure that I realized I had been doing it all wrong. I wasn’t trying to just learn from my past, I had just been reliving each memory instead of observing the memory. That turn let me actually go back and look at the situation, not myself, and observe my impact on that moment in time. That helped me greatly, the realization that I had to observe and not relive. 

Best of luck for ya.","gfk04u3",1,1607794393,"2020-12-12 17:33:13"

"5954","When I was diagnosed as a kid, nothing about ADHD was explained to me, so I just thought I was a failure who needed a drug to keep up. Well, turned out I had a serious problem with crashing on that drug, so every night I would feel like absolute shit, until one night I started feeling suicidal. Me being a young kid who wasn't put in any kind of therapy to build skills to cope with ADHD (since my child brain wasn't developed enough to monitor and regulate things) didn't know what was happening, didn't know how to process that feeling so never talked to my parents or doctor, felt like again I was the problem. I started palming my medication every morning then going to the bathroom and flushing it. I blocked the whole event from memory. That's not okay.

It took me a decade to get to college, have my life fall apart, look deeply into myself which didn't succeed until after a total mental break, and recover and safely process those traumatic memories before I could seek ADHD treatment again. 10mg ritalin totally fixes me, and my entire life story could've been prevented with some explanation and a bit of therapy.

In the end, I don't blame my parents. I don't think they knowingly did anything wrong. I'm not even sure they got ADHD explained to them. Maybe I hold some blame for the doctor for not treating it as seriously as he should have. Maybe I blame the system that allows ADHD to be treated so trivially. I don't know who I blame, really. All I know is that the people who cared did their best, but their best was only as good as the awareness they had. Unfortunately for me, that was none.","go12zs9",1,1613757342,"2021-02-19 17:55:42"

Maybe try weening off caffeine, so you loose headaches, and see if no cafeine gives better results? Just based on my expirence. Or it could be vyvanse isn't the one for you, since it needs to metabolize before it takes effect.

I am not sure of a way I can drink coffee and my vyvanse works at the same time though, sorry!

I'm just putting this out there because stereotypes of people with Asperger's lead to it often being overlooked as a potential diagnosis, especially for women. As a guy who sometimes drift towards loneliness and particular interests, Asperger's was one of the first things my doc checked me for, but I've heard so many women describing the same problems and ASD is never even brought up, because there seem to be a subconscious bias that makes many of us (doctors included) less prone to put the label ""aspie"" on a woman (and more likely to slap ""bipolar"" on every woman who ever has had any emotional issue.)","dyfh1n4",18,1525423469,"2018-05-04 08:44:29"

---

&gt;

&gt;The process model of emotion regulation is based upon the modal model of emotion. The modal model of emotion suggests that the emotion generation process occurs in a particular sequence over time. This sequence occurs as follows:

&gt;


&gt;* Situation: the sequence begins with a situation (real or imagined) that is emotionally relevant.

&gt;* [Attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention): attention is directed towards the emotional situation.

&gt;* [Appraisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_appraisal): the emotional situation is evaluated and interpreted.

&gt;* Response: an emotional response is generated, giving rise to loosely coordinated changes in experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.

&gt;Because an emotional response (4.) can cause changes to a situation (1.), this model involves a feedback loop from (4.) Response to (1.) Situation. This feedback loop suggests that the emotion generation process can occur recursively, is ongoing, and dynamic. 

&gt;The process model contends that each of these four points in the emotion generation process can be subjected to regulation. From this conceptualization, the process model posits five different families of emotion regulation that correspond to the regulation of a particular point in the emotion generation process. They occur in the following order:

&gt;


&gt;* Situation selection

&gt;* Situation modification

&gt;* Attentional deployment

&gt;* Cognitive change

&gt;* Response modulation. 

&gt;The process model also divides these emotion regulation strategies into two categories: antecedent-focused and response-focused. Antecedent-focused strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, and cognitive change) occur before an emotional response is fully generated. Response-focused strategies (i.e., response modulation) occur after an emotional response is fully generated.

"5994","As the others have suggested, definitely bring it up with your doctor but I have also experienced this - I started medication for the first time, same exact dose - Adderall 20 mg XR. I was so happy to be mediated it didn’t even bother me thst the first week i was on it I got absolutely TERRIBLE SLEEP - a week of poor sleep with 1 to 2 days of nothing.

BUT, i noticed the weeks after my sleep has been leagues better - and I realize the reason for my issues is due to poor sleep hygiene BEFORE starting medication.

That is, before medication my sleep was awful - I was going to bed by 3/4am,but never tre same time,  alongside worrying abt my day to day stresses - and forcing myself to wake up after not sleeping much. This poor routine of sleep, combined w medication - destroyed my chances of sleeping the first week of starting.

To solve this, i started sleeping at a good time each night (like 1/2am lol) and waking up at the same time (10 am) so i take my medication at the same time each morning. This routine of forcing myself to gotocbed solves my sleep problems because my body adjusted to the medication - it recognized when i needed to sleep rather than never having a schedule - and i was able to start falling asleep naturally.

It’s very difficult at first - especially when sleep deprived and as a college student where having a sleep routine is already insanely difficult. I suggest taking medication earlier and having orange juice/vitamin C a few hours before bed (i drink it if i need it around 9/10pm) but holding yourself to your sleep schedule.

If problems persist, contact your doctor ASAP.","ejnpol0",1,1553868987,"2019-03-29 14:16:27"

"6027","Tl;dr: New Redditor; I think I may have ADHD. My Pebble watch's notifications/timers/alarms have been a huge help. 

Full version:  I've been lurking here for several weeks -- this post encouraged me to finally join.

I bought my Pebble Time Steel last year because I wanted to use it to compensate for some early-onset hearing loss (30 at the time). Phone sounds are rarely acceptable at my job and I could no longer hear the phone vibration if it was sitting on my desk, causing me to miss calls and texts. Surgery remedied my hearing, but I've been exploring the possibility of my having ADHD for the last few months. 

In that time, I've noticed myself using the tools on the Pebble extensively. Multiple alarms to wake up in the morning.  Timers when I'm cooking or so I don't forget clothes in the washer or dryer.  Event Notifications pushed over from my phone calendar to the Pebble timeline.  I even found I can use either a Pomodoro Pebble app or use a phone app that will push the Pomodoro notifications to the watch. 

For me, it was and continues to be an indispensable tool (and occasional source of distraction).","d84o9s4",1,1475012159,"2016-09-27 21:35:59"
"6028","&gt;Also don't take more than one math class a semester in college unless you're gifted in math.
  
Oh, if only I had a choice. Here it's basically 

1. Math **C** (algebra, basic trigonometry, some functions and percentages/statistics), then 
2. Math **B** (small amount of algebra as a refresher, advanced trig, functions, derivatives, inverse functions and other nebulous ways to twist numbers) and then finally 
3. Math **A** (fuck me, uhhh, I think it's more of a theoretical class, with having to prove the proofs of the stuff you learnt in C &amp; B, and even more nebulous laws, constants and other hebrew scripture mixed in). 
  
All of them typically take a year to complete, and have an oral and a written exam.
Just found out I probably passed Math B first try, so looking forward to math A come January. Wish me luck, I sure know I'm going to need it. 
  
Also, is it universal that math teachers seem to hate their life, and take it out on their students?

"6040","Willpower suggests that all people have an equal capacity to put in effort and do something, that a failure to do so is a character flaw to be blamed on the person or their parents.  It's a false concept because people with ADHD actually find it much harder to show ""willpower"" than others and when we fail it isn't a character flaw, it is a disorder.  

The fidgeting is only a symptom of a symptom. Yes you could focus on not doing it, but you cannot stop the inner restlessness which causes you to fidget. Other people don't experience this inner sense of restlessness and so have no need to actually think about staying still.  

Also our fidgeting, our sense of restlessness is something of a coping mechanism of our brain. It's trying to wake itself up because the ADHD brain is underactive. Studies have found kids with ADHD show improved performance on tasks with increased fidgeting. 

Even if you do control your hand movements you'll just move more in other ways. They did a study of adults with inattentive type ADHD, the least likely to be hyperactive, and found they actually had pronounced motor hyperactivity (excessive movement of head, arms and legs) compared to normal controls when they put motion capture tech on them and asked them to do tasks requiring concentration.

"6045","Californian here. A GP isn’t qualified to diagnose ADHD. Not technically, at least. Mental health disorders are usually specific to mental health practioners. Need an evaluation from a psychologist who specializes in ADHD. A psychiatrist can also specialize in diagnosing the disorder but you’re likely to get a more comprehensive evaluation if you go to a psychologist. I’d recommend this if you’re expecting long term care, ever want to get help from a psychiatrist—who has a much better understanding of the various and proper medications—, or want to be more sure of your condition. That said, even a comprehensive diagnosis can leave doubt. 


Truth be told, it’s not as straightforward and clear cut as the mental health community makes out. Neurological and genetic comprehension is still in its infancy but American neuroscience and clinical psychology/psychiatry is pretty far along in comparison to the rest of the world (even if our health care/insurance system sucks).  It’s not always about what’s your disorder but rather is there significant dysfunction, can (and should) it be treated pharmacologically, and what best helps alleviate symptoms. A proper diagnosis can help point the way to the right treatment(s). Could have straightforward ADHD, could also have a comorbidity that complicates things a little, could have ADHD plus a thyroid issue, could be ADHD with sleep apnea, could just be sleep apnea, etc. Stimulants could just be a part of the answer, the entire answer, or none of it.  Always best to get comprehensive medical help if you want to find an optimal solution.

"6055","Gifted can be a LOT of different things.  It's an AWFUL term, in part because it is so vague, and in part because it tends to put a lot of pressure on kids because people use the word ""gifted"" to mean ""smart"".  So get ready to watch their self-esteem plummet and anxiety overwhelm them when they come up against something challenging that they might fail at.  Must not be smart after all.  And when your whole identity and self-worth is tied up with being smart, that can be devastating.  

Gifted is usually used in an academic setting to describe one of the following groups of kids:

1). It is often used for well behaved, well prepared children.  If your parents consistently read to you, practiced flash cards, found extracurriculars, tutors, and immersion experiences for you, there is a good chance you will be labeled as ""gifted"" early on.  Imagine the luck.

2).  There are some children (a small, but still large enough percentage) that are stronger academically.  Think the top 5% of your class.  These are kids that likely are well prepared, but likely also simply have a natural talent for vocabulary, processing speed, spatial awareness, reasoning, memory, or all of the above (notice how none of the things I listed are actual subjects in school).  You can be gifted and suck at math, or great at math, but not gifted.

Usually these kids will process material faster than their peers.  A concept that might take an average student a whole class period to grasp, they understand in 5-10 minutes of explanation.  They will usually make connections with the material more quickly and relate seemingly unrelated ideas in new or unusual ways.   They may not relate to their rest of their peers as well because they have slightly different interests and the way they talk about things differs slightly from the average kid.   From a social standpoint it can be helpful to have some gifted programs for these kids, because it helps them move through material quicker and helps them find peers that make those same unusual connections between ideas, and find a place that makes them feel like they fit in.

Most ""Gifted"" track programs in schools are dealing with group 2, and probably a few of the kids in group 1 with pushy parents.

3). The oh my god, this person is a complete genius kids.  These are the rare kids that blow everyone else out of the water.  The ones that are not only ahead of their peers in terms of understanding, but can give their teachers a run for their money, and probably the only ones to which the title ""gifted"" really applies.  While you are off playing with the duplo legos, they are building a scale replica of the Golden Gate Bridge that's the size of an entire room.

At the end of the day though it's just a label, and usually it's one that only serves to make parents feel good.  I imagine there's plenty of people that are gifted in other areas that are completely overlooked in an academic setting.  Because skill in a sport, the arts, or something like carpentry or whatever aren't part of how we assess school performance.  There's also a number of people that have been labeled gifted that are dumber than a box of rocks.  Just because someone is really good at math and science doesn't mean they have the common sense to know how to apply it in the real world.

There are plenty of people that will be labeled ""gifted"" that are not neuro-typical just like anything else.  At the end of the day, I don't recommend putting much stock into it one way or another.","geztlxe",1,1607382077,"2020-12-07 23:01:17"

"6058","The notion that taking notes digitally is worse drives me nuts. I'm a computer nut and type 90wpm and also greatly prefer taking notes via OneNote. . Once I switched to typing notes it made a massive difference in retention of content. 

Writing is ""better"" usually because people will just hammer the slides for notes word for word into their laptop. Simply replicating the words does very, little for helping you remember it. Instead, attack it as if you were wanting to explain what you're learning to a friend. You have the ability to type faster than you write most likely, so make use of it. Expand beyond what's in front of you, and use the tools available to organize. The process of formatting and   organizing my notes serves as a great way for me to process what I'm typing. The ease of entry and formatting encourages me to ""get it all. "" Frequently in class I find myself taking more thorough and organized notes than my peers in less time. I then have time format as needed.

When I wrote notes I would skip over writing things down because I ""already knew it"" and it would take too long. In the end my written notes were jumbled, sparse and mostly useless. Now I treat each set of notes as a study guide I'd give to a friend . Being overly detailed and explaining    helps you fully grasp what you're learning.

Naturally digital notes aren't  ideal for math subjects and the like, but helped me greatly in nearly every class. DIgital notes also benefit from sync, allowing me to view my notes on my phone, laptop,  or desktop when desired. 

TL;DR 

Digital notes can be great, and it depends entirely upon you as for  what will work best.

Alleles associated with ADHD have a heritability of 60 to 75%, High frequency of genetic variants implies trait had survival advantage in past.
Most or all humans were hunter-gatherers for hundreds of thousands of years before becoming predominantly stagnant farmers. An adaptation that was positively selected for potentially due to survival advantages presented by increased impulsivity such as quicker response to danger or stressful situations and possibly hunting skill.  This is supported by the presence of the DRD4 variant in higher frequencies in nomadic populations. Nomadic Ariaal men with DRD4 variant appear to be healthier than those without the variant, and in stagnant populations those with the DRD4 variant had slightly worse health. Environment determines whether the trait is advantageous, and yes this is a bit of a reach but it is as solid in my mind as the subjective DSM criteria that many seem to be clinging to

"6118","Dude, you just described me in the past. Also 25 and had longtime relationship with porn+games since i was a kid. Weed came to my life at when i was about 15 and even though i smoked it just when i wanted to, i would smoke it everyday if i had it with me just to deal with boredom wich is a constant for people with adhd. The moment I had the same realization that you just had I knew I should stop with porn (couldnt hurt to at least try it, right?). The change was almost palpable (the irony) since my hand isnt my mistress anymore and the advice i can give you is just this: give a try to give it up and see for yourself.

"6120","Please read my above answer. It should answer some of your questions.  
But also...  
Because when I feel down it's always because of some bad consequences which as I now see clearly... are the result from ADHD behavior.  
* Not studying for a test =&gt; bad mark =&gt; feel bad =&gt; soon forget all about it =&gt; repeat cycle until whole semester is crap =&gt; a slight depression
* Someone says something mean =&gt; I attack them (even if I'm weaker) =&gt; I get picked on even more =&gt; I feel bad (but still repeated this until I was stalked and beaten by older guys and their friends constantly)
* I feel positive and great =&gt; there's no pain (immediate deadline, angry client etc) to motivate me to work =&gt; so I procrastinate with work (because there's still time, why shouldn't 1 hour be enough to complete a whole day of work? who said you can't create facebook in a week?) =&gt; work doesn't get done =&gt; It's time to go to bed, but the deadline is tomorrow =&gt; I work all night =&gt; I'm exhausted in the morning, my sleep routine is fucked, next day I'm too depressed to work, to shower, to do something else and now indeed depression makes things worse...  
Anyway... my point isn't that I don't have depression or aspergers or anxiety... my point is that they're comorbid and some of them are simply a result of ADHD.","d4u1wrs",1,1467300271,"2016-06-30 15:24:31"

"6128","My suggestion would be to first already have an idea of or better yet know exactly what subject or type of book that you are wanting/thinking about getting.

Then either go and focus on that ""target"" first, you also can ask for ""help"" from your partner or someone who works at the store.

The goal here is to try to limit the wandering, and to essentially focus on a single area of books.

So if my interest was SciFi, then I'd go and look in that area, it would be even better if I had one or more titles or authors that I was interested in, that way I could focus on searching for and finding a particular thing, which helps me to avoid straying.

I also force myself to pick a book shelf, and then scan the shelves one at a time, usually top to bottom and left to right.  If something catches my eye, I stop, pull it out, and take a look at the cover, the back or inside (where there is info on the author/contents) and if it still seems interesting, for ""story books"" I go to a random page near the middle and read a paragraph or two. 

If it's interesting, then I put it in my basket or buy pile, and when my basket or pile has the number of books or has hit the monetary amount I had set earlier.  I just stop and I'm ""done"" for now, and if I was ""shopping"" with others, I would then just wander around and ""see"" what else is in the other areas.

I'm able to do actually roam stores and not get overwhelmed, because I've already reached my goal, so there is really very little or no pressure which makes it more enjoyable and/or even fun.

If I happen to ""find"" something in another section and it's really interesting, then I would go and pick out one of the books in my basket or buy pile and return it.

I don't have to search the whole store or even the entire book shelf or section, because I can and will be going back, and/so for me there is really no ""pressure"" to look at everything at one time.

If I was looking for a particular book or series, then I try my best to stay on ""target"" and just look for that book or series.  After I'm done looking for that one ""target"" is when I am ""allowed"" to ""look"" at other ""stuff"".  This is really hard, but I just keep telling myself that I have to do this/follow my own rules, because if I don't, I will end up doing the ""walk of shame"" because I'll end up not finding anything, due to becoming overwhelmed and having no focus.

If I'm looking for a book to do a task (cooking, fixing things, etc) then it's a little different, since I now have to look in each of the books that look like they meet the requirements.  For these I usually end up flipping through the book first, to quickly see if there are enough photos and if the photos are useful, and if it passes this part, I then take a closer look at a single task and/or the writing style to see if it is in a format that I can actually process.

If I'm looking for cookbooks to use with my Instant Pot, I have to work to keep ignoring the ""regular"" cookbooks.  I can always come back to have a look later (if I remember) once I meet my ""goal"" of finding an IP cookbook that looks like it's going to work for me.

For more technical books, it's a similar process, I try my best to stay on ""target"" and I have to skip/ignore the Apple/Mac books when I'm looking for a book about Windows or Windows programs.  In this case I also need to first make sure that any book I pick up, is ""current"" and actually applies.  An awesome looking Win 7 book, is not what I am needing, if I'm using Win 10, so I need to put it back and keep looking.

For me, it's mostly about having an pretty good idea on what I am looking for or am going to look for.  Then I start there, and stay there until I either find/reach my goal or I run out of books (scanning/looking top to bottom and left to right).  If I run out of books, then I go to the next ""target"".

Once I reach my limit/quota, then I'm ""done"" and that's when I can go out and wander without really having to worry about being overwhelmed or ""finding something"" because I'm already ""done"".

I go shopping in a similar way, I first go and get the things I went to the store to get, when that's done, I can go and wander/shop.

Grocery shopping at a ""super store"" is a little more difficult, since I really cannot wander around the store with frozen stuff in my cart, that is if I want them to still be frozen.

So in this case, I do all the non-frozen shopping first, and then go back at the end, to pickup the frozen and or cold stuff that really should/needs to stay cold.  So in this case, I end up doing important shopping twice, one at the beginning and once at the end.  It usually works, because it's become a habit to go to the frozen section when I'm on my way to checkout.

And if I forget, then I can simply go back and then just pickup the ""forgotten"" frozen and/or cold stuff, and this time not go and look at other stuff or go ""shopping"", since I had just done that earlier or more like yesterday.

Not sure if this made sense to you or if any of it will help you, but these are some of the things that I do when shopping, that help me to be more successful and it helps to make trips and shopping less stressful and more fun.

Other than that, I just accept that I will mess up at times, and that it's OK because that's just a part of what/how I am.  I acknowledge my error/mistake, then try to think about what I could/should have done, and then I try that the next time.   I do feel bad about what has happened, but I don't beat myself up over it, I just strive to do better in the future.  

Hang in there, not being able to buy a book isn't the end of the world.  When you are feeling better go back and try again, and hopefully you will be successful and then you can overwrite the ""failure"" with a ""success"".

I might even rap my fist on it and listen to the sound, or smell it or... well I probably wouldn't lick it, but the idea is to get in touch with something without really resorting to thinking about it. It is nice to do this with a flower or tree or a blade of grass. The more concrete, and multi-sensory the thing is the better. Food is great for this. If you know how to play a musical instrument it is great for this. Just make a sound on it and listen to the reality of that sound and to the silence when it fades/stops.

"6139","WE respond to rewards, but we need to get the reward much faster than others for it to count. The association of the reward for the task falls out of our brain the moment we get distracted after the task.  Rewards don't feel real to us. They feel arbitrary because the way that they have been given to us our entire life. Ido better on the test after studying, but I don't get the results back until next Thursday, and I did the studying last Wednesday night.  

So I don't feel good about studying, at least not unless I choose to concentrate on that association that my better marks are because of the studying. repeating ""that studying sure made me awesome"" to myself every time I think about either My marks or studying.  I'll forget to remember that though, unless I place reminders in my space.

I love solving computer problems. But that is because after each thing I try, I can test, and get that reward while I'm still concentrating on the task.  So many things aren't rewarding while you do them, only afterwards. Those things that I am bad at, is generally because I can't enjoy practicing anything that doesn't reward me immediately. 

Its one of the reasons why reading was so huge for me as a child. Each time I read a word, I knew whether it was right or wrong based on the context of the sentence. The reward is instant.   


Its why theory is easier for me to learn than the practical parts. Its why I never pursued physics. If when they explain the theory it makes sense, I'm rewarded instantly at the end of each sentence or paragraph. If they are trying to show me a mathematical proof of it, I need to push through many steps of calculation just to get the single reward of ""this is the right answer"" You only know that each intermediate step is correct because the final answer is right. and if it takes a few minutes to get there, I'm already distracted.","g35mvea",5,1598636646,"2020-08-28 17:44:06"

"6147","This sounds a lot like a family member who had an unusual combination of symptoms from several ""minimal brain dysfunctions"": Some traits of Asperger's, some of Bipolar, and an official diagnosis of ADHD. It eventually worsened into agoraphobia and self-harm, and she's been in and out of mental health for suicide watch and assault and battery.

The ADHD and antidepressants made some aspects better and some aspects much worse, so she would often stop taking those meds when the worst behaviors started seriously interfering with her quality of life.

Considering that you live alone, I would hate to think of something similar happening over time in your case. I think if she had been more thoroughly evaluated and given more clinical trials instead of just a prescription and a ""good luck"", her life may have been so different. Trying different meds sucks a lot, but not as much as being forced into mental institutions that *you know* will make life much worse.

I learnt what is an academically dry, boring, intense field in the most intuitive way to me possible by wasting hours on Quake 2 making mods for myself out of tutorials I gathered from an old site called QDevelS.  I did it to have a mod more than become a programmer, and I assumed I would get a job 'with computers' at that age but no real plans.  Just the act of resolving build errors and updating the sometimes outdated tutorials to compile with the latest and greatest Quake 2 patch versions was enough to each me the basics by osmosis.  Then years later I began to have programming lessons in college and I was lucky enough to have enough of a base and an interest to develop a hyperfocus on programming, and the rest is history as programming is a bottomless pit of study at times.

Nowadays I'm quite fecking bored of it.  I have no real problems to solve myself (you can get it all online most of the time) and games etc are too much effort for me to consider spending time trying to plan a project out for myself - plus a day's programming is enough without 'venting' time at home - but I'm at the point where only the boilerplate code is painfully tedious to operate with.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development

We humans create ""social structures"" to modify time and space, to bring the EROs, the Events, the Responses, and the Outcomes either closer together or farther apart on purpose to make it easier for human cognition to organize against the problems of the day.

We do this for all humans.

***Links a video, and I want you to watch 3 minutes and 30 seconds.*** (the video is longer and is part of a playlist for an entire lecture.)

All people even these ""sink or swim"" people will admit that society modifies time and space with our social structures, our ""prosthesis"" (this is how ZPD is communicated in modern terms, we call it prosthesis like how crutches or a cane can help someone simulate walking) that are social can change the outcome by making things easier to do or harder to do.

So I am saying even your teacher will admit there is a problem and we create solutions.  She just does not want a dynamic solution for that means more work for her.

"6214","&gt;A mental disorder or mental illness is a psychological pattern or anomaly, potentially reflected in behavior, that is generally associated with distress or disability, and which is not considered part of normal development of a person's culture

From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder

Let's look at the different components of this definition:

* Psychological pattern or anomaly: Certainly, given that there is no cure for ADHD
* Potentially reflected in behaviour: Almost certainly, especially in the case of those with combined or hyperactive subtypes
* Generally associated with stress or disability: Disability might be a tad strong, but I know that, in my case at least, the inability to perform routine day-to-day tasks and carry out important responsibilities was an enormous source of stress and depression for me
* Is not considered a part of normal development of a person's culture: Again, I'd say ADHD qualifies, given that our culture dictates a very specific way of doing things that is inconsistent with how an ADHD person works.

"6235","My parents were also Christians and I had to get education up until my confirmation but after that they told me it was up to me to decide. The education was separate from school (Sweden is very secular) and I enjoyed it.

I know the feeling of having to relearn everything. My parents are the age of most grandparents and haven’t quite gotten that what worked when they were young has a very different effect in today’s social interaction. Forgot your wallet on the bus? You didn’t have to worry, you’d get it back. It was normal to just walk into other people’s houses. Solidarity and community played a huge role. Society has changed so rapidly that pretty much nothing they knew is the same anymore. I grew up in a different world from them.

So all the social skills I learned apply well on people of the older generations still familiar with them but they alienate me from people my own age. I was told I spoke and acted like a dinosaur. So I can understand your struggle.

And I never learned to assert myself, argue for something or reason because my parents always knew best and were irrational. “Because you are the kid and I’m the adult” was a common end to every discussion but “Because I’m just a kid and you are adults” was never considered valid. I was simply to do what they told me to do. I got completely railroaded by my parents, lol. ","dr0ht58",1,1512858145,"2017-12-09 22:22:25"

Once I have a technique down, I'm golden. It just takes a little extra to get it cemented into my brain and hands.

I would suggest that you ask your professors if you may attend an extra lab session. Go to a lab before yours, and sit where you can observe and take notes. Don't interact, just take notes. Look for tricky steps and try to record any questions you have about what's going on. Be quiet and don't disturb anyone.

Hopefully that will help you be better prepared when your lab rolls around. Try and think about what will be difficult beforehand.

Do you have a kitchen?

Learn to cook. Following recipes is a good way to practice following detailed instructions in a low pressure situation.

One of the biggest bullshit things about our education model for the sciences is that there is very little opportunity for practice. Skills I use daily I only got to do once if at all while in school. That's very unfortunate. Most techniques aren't simple, and the chance to do something multiple times only increases your ability to understand and perform.

"6263","My experience is similar to whom you responded to.

Remember, having just started medication, the side-effects are more intense than they will be in time. Right now, i know how erratic your mood seems with medication, but that's normal. The irritability is caused by an attention-span drop off that comes with adderall wearing off; believe it or not, it's actually not the dopamine high your after, it's the attention span. Anyway, having adhd, your dopamine only feels high because of how relatively low it is, it's actually being put up to a normal level.

With time, your body will become used to the meds and you're irritability and anxiety will decrease with time. That said, there are still bad days.

The best way i've found is to drink coffee or a soda when my meds start to wear off. Anything with a decent caffeine dosage will work. It's a mild stimulant and will help round off the steep drop-off and you'll feel better.","dl3hrg4",1,1501736250,"2017-08-03 04:57:30"

1) A song. Always a song. The volume on the song can change, but it's always there.

2) A phrase or words I heard someone say. It's never a complete thought, sometimes it's just words that assembled themselves in the back of my head and it's my voice saying the words, but they repeat themselves on loop. Sometimes there are 2 of these tracks, one with words and one with nonsense sounds (3 if I'm trying to sleep). They never sync with the song, either.

3) My internal monologue, which finds everything intriguing but won't pay attention to anything for more than a few moments before it feels let down when the idea of a thing was more exciting than the thing itself. Or it remembers something else and it's off in a completely different direction. That XKCD cartoon with the balloons illustrates this track really well.

4) A sort of fuzz or rhythm with a tempo that varies from day to day. I don't ""hear"" any sound from it. There is no pitch or tone or key; it's closer to the *concept* of a beat.

This reminds me of another trick I use. It's kind of abstract, but I'm gonna try to explain it...

Sometimes my husband will start talking to me and while I hear every word, I still can't make sense of what he's getting at. Often it happens when I've been hyper focusing and I haven't yet fully shifted my focus. Other times, I suspect it's because I'm trying to figure out ""the point"" before he's made it. Regardless, the trick is that I basically ask for a topic sentence. He doesn't even have to tell me ""the point"" -- just a verbal nudge in the direction he's going is enough to clear up my brain to listen. 

I explained it by saying that it feels like I'm reading a letter without first seeing the envelope; and I need more information before I can take it in. I'll say, ""Back up. I need an envelope for this first."" And he'll say ""I'm trying to tell you what the cats did today.""

- as does communication, maybe try telling him your feelings but do your best not to blame him for it, just explain what the issue is and say what you feel and would like.

Easiest recipe for me is - chop up some potato's and onions, if you have carrots, celery or other veggies - add em, but if not, it's okay. Throw some cheap cuts of meat (any kind-i like diced beef,or pork chops), pour in like a dollup of cooking oil (any kind), add half a pack of onion soup mix, about 2 cups of broth (it should cover about half the other ingredients), salt, pepper, and put the lid on and forget it for anywhere between 4-7 hours. It takes 10 minutes to prep,and will feed you for a few days.  

You really can't fuck it up. Everything tastes good. You can vary the spices, vegetables, broth, meats, but as long as you never use straight water as your liquid, and make sure that there's at least 2 knuckles of liquid in the bottom, you'll be fine. 

The first few times I cooked with one, I was worried I'd forget to come home and turn it off, so I plugged it in before bed and cooked it overnight. My house smelled like heaven in the morning, and I had lunch ready to go, so that's always an option too.

"6329","I had academic issues my first year of college, but that is mostly because I didn't attend class very much.  After that I did fine while waitressing full time.  My brain is very good at rote memorization and fact retention, I am also good at picking out what might be a test question, so I didn't have to study much.  I always did papers as soon as I could when assigned, because I didn't like having that on my plate, since I was working so much.  That being said, I didn't always do my homework as a kid.  I also skipped any assignments that I knew were not going to make much of a difference in my grade percentage.

I had problems halfway though my doctorate degree.  Labs and clinicals were harder, and caused me a lot of performance and social anxiety.  I was told my whole life how smart I am, so when I ran into something difficult, I faltered.  I then read a lot of books about how to make people like me more, and when people like you, they will give you a more favorable grade (when the grading is more subjective, like how well I could examine a patient).

Things got significantly harder when I entered the work force, and I was new at having a job with many minor and major tasks.  I had a hard time figuring out what was important.  I also was struggling with significant mental illness, which started to rear its ugly head with the uptick in stress.  Patient care, billing, note-taking, keeping on task, being far from perfect.  I was very sensitive and offended to constructive criticism, and it cost me a couple of jobs.  
My home life has always been in some level of shambles.  Without the structure of school and working, I lost my ability to figure out what was important, how to organize and manage what little time I have.

"6330","Oh my god yes this is pretty much exactly my experience!! In my unscientific opinion, I think it might have to do with a couple of different ADHD things. For reference, I'm 21F &amp; medicated. 

For one thing, I often find myself in phases (a couple hours during the day, for weeks, it varies) where I do not want to be touched. Like, even regular non-sexual touch. I read in some ADHD book somewhere that this can be a symptom (I can *probably* find the source if you're really interested). Sometimes this can translate into feeling borderline sex-repulsed, like you mentioned! 

Re: masturbation -- I go in phases with this as well. Definitely enjoy it when I remember to do it LOL. Just like everything else, it does slip through the cracks sometimes. But yeah, sometimes i'll go for weeks without masturbating and then all of a sudden realize that it's a thing that i can do!! Then i go wild. So for me, at least part of this sexual fluctuation is related to actually remembering that it exists. I've recently tried to start thinking about masturbation as something more like exercise -- more of an active, consistent self-care thing than an ""i'll do it when i feel like it"" thing. Who knows.

I think that my horny flipside is a bit less intense than yours, but I definitely experience it. I also think it might be sort of universal phenomenon that the more you masturbate/have sex, the more you want to keep doing it (im extrapolating anecdotal evidence from a conversation i had with like 3 or 4 of my friends, so this might not be true at all -- but it's at least confirmed true for 4-5 people!)

At the end of the day though I think it's always useful to scale back and ask yourself if you're putting yourself through mental torment because you have an idea of the way your sex drive ""should"" be. like, who says we have to be moderately interested in sex all the time?!? Sounds abnormal to me :)

Being a female with hyperactivity it presented itself as easy distractibility, fidgeting, talking to desk mates in class, getting up a lot from my seat and moving around, getting in trouble for outbursts and commentary that got the whole class laughing to the point I was put in the single desk front and centre of every class from grade 4 onwards. 

I had a lot of trouble making friends with girls because all they would do is stand around at recess and gab. I had zero desire to do that and thus was friends with a lot of boys. I also went on a lot of ""adventures"" aka sneaking into places I wasn't supposed to be. People thought I was weird and brave. But I was just an unmedicated kid with ADHD haha. 

I experimented a lot in high school with sex and drugs. Being in a religious private school, this was really looked down upon and people rejected me even further. I got depressed and this spiralled. I moved out and left town at 18 and that was the best decision of my life.

"6358","Hey, the internet is a great place to look for support, and seeing a therapist is also wonderful progress.

Take things one day at a time, don't get caught up in trying to fix everything at once.

Get a notebook. When you wakeup in the morning divide a small portion in half, on one side write your schedule for the day (times included!), and on the other write a ""to-do"" list

Populate the to-do list with a few goals to do for the day. Whether it be homework, cleaning your room, even as simple as making your bed!

As you complete the tasks check them off the list and before you go to bed each night review your goals for the day.

Make sure you have no ""zero days"". Do something to help yourself out each and every day.

I know it's tough, but you've got to use the supports around you as just that: supports. You are at the core, you are the driver of change. Accept help, but also take action!

You're strong for making it this far, just keep working, one step at a time.

ADHD is a disorder that strongly affects our ability to imagine deadlines/future consequences. The only solution is to externalize those deadlines. Write them down, plan them out. Yes it will/may take you longer to accomplish your goals than others, but that's just our lot in life friend.

"6359","Oh and just to add to this. The debt I was tracking in my Excel burndown was credit card refinance loans. I used SoFi but whatever company you get a good deal from can help.

Refinance is perfect if you can maintain the discipline, always budget money to the payment, and avoid using the credit cards for things besides the occasional small subscription to keep up payment history. It lets you immediately switch to using debit from your paycheck. And it adds a bit of pressure to perform, while simultaneously removing the anxiety from the CC balance carrying over.

But you HAVE to commit to ending each month with zero balance and making the refi payment every month if you refinance. Only a catastrophe should see your balance rise.

YNAB was perfect with the refi for me because of how it both visually and methodically deters you from using the CC as extra cash.","gvcd3hc",1,1619024337,"2021-04-21 16:58:57"

It's helped tremendously. I'm no expert but I don't think Strattera would work well with Vyvanse. You want something that's instant release.

"6381","That exact cycle has taken years from my life in the past. I fought so hard to try to make myself do the things I needed to but eventually found out the fight is more about keeping myself from partaking in the things I do instead of what's important. Honestly if you can cut the porn/jerking to once a week or even less and stay off social media/reddit you should soon get a boost in motivation. They strain your dopamine system without providing any actual reward which leads you with less dopamine to motivate you to do real shit.    
  

I honestly didn't think I had a problem but when I couldn't go a week without masturbating or peeking at porn it opened my eyes. Now if I manage to stay away from mindless interneting, porn, video games, masturbating, smoking weed for a week I end up with tons of energy and drive to do things. It's just so hard to start those streaks because you find yourself sitting there like ""wtf am I supposed to do now?"" and you're too burnt out and numb to want to do anything that takes effort. Start slow those days and just go for walks, do a few small tasks like cleaning to get some motivation, and exercise early in the day if you can. Just remember the start is the hardest it's going to be. Honestly just quitting those kinds of things seriously feels like my brain starts to change after a week. It's to the point where I'm off medication because I find I can get better results on my own. I do fall off these habits sometimes though and go right back to being a slug sitting in my room.

And mindfulness can be used with many forms of physical activity that require repetitive motion without a lot of sudden changes (jogging, swimming, weightlifting, etc).  

Visualization is probably better when you're not moving (although everyone's different!), and is more about using your imagination to maintain an image of a place--like a peaceful beach, or sometimes a journey, like a walk through the woods.

This is the true meaning of missing. Once, when we were all the same, you were the whole, the holiest; both male and female in one body you were the holy keeper of gender equality. You are the most-loved and most-gifted child of the Mothers, helping us remember that we are all the same.

**Oksáhgká**, the Shining Grandmother of the Door, the Change, sends you her love 💛💛💛💛 and warmth and will watch over your change as a mother watches her child. Like you contain both man and woman, she contains night and day, winter and summer, death and life. She reassures you that change is natural, change is inevitable. Everything, even mountains change, because we are all the children of the Earth so we are all the same. 

**Madtegháhgká**, the 🌳🌍Mother of all sends you her love 💚💚💚💚 and whispers that we are all her little walking tree children and she loves us all equally.

ADHD certainly is a problem fro people, I'm not trying to dismiss that. I'm just saying its a problem because we are systematically forced to submit to a system that wants us to act and behave in a way that we a biologically wired against. As a result we become very broken people with serious disorders. If we were raised in a more nurturing world that took notice of what makes us unique and tried to focus on growing our strengths we would grow up to be people capable of doing things others can't, at levels few of us can rarely achieve now. It's a matter of perspective that makes us look broken, and that become a self fulfilling prophecy that breaks us.","cei2n4o",1,1388954043,"2014-01-05 20:34:03"

For that very reason they will look at you as a drug seeker until you prove them otherwise. My psychiatrists were very hesitant to prescribe me with adhd medication. The first one didn't do it until both my GAD and depression had been controlled for. (This was in undergrad) that's when I was perscribed with vyvanse and it helped.

When I got to my PhD program, they were like yeaaaaaa.... you were never officially tested and we aren't going to give you meds until you do get officially tested.

Okay that's literally what I did before getting told I had anxiety and high functioning depression and these were just intrusive thoughts

My parents had a similar reaction as your wife and told me to stop looking for symptoms on the internet, I just needed a better schedule and some *focus* in life. I almost had to convince my doctor I had ADHD while doubting if it was just confirmation bias and thank fuck she trusted me 

So now I do have stims and they aren't life changing but understanding ADHD and maybe getting a clear diagnosis was the thing that helped me. Now I can be more careful and get tools and support for this chaotic condition.

Draconiaa could be alluding to one of the goals in behavior therapy, which is to develop habits to help long term.  It takes a while though.  Also it doesn't work without medication, because without the medication developing a habit isn't going to happen.  It does show higher improvements than simply medication alone. 

Since you seem interested i can describe the program for my behavior therapy, maybe able to look it up online? It seems to be a standardized thing in weekly packets that was used in a study, those with meds and those without.

Basically you start by having a calendar and a to do list.  Get used to using them.  Every thing you need to do and don't want to and unmotivated to, as well as crap that enters you brain like 'really gotta get more socks' and 'f i need a big pot for making chili'.  Every obligation you have you write in your calendar.

Now that you have a list, through out the week try to do some of it.  Honestly made me feel better, medication helped my brain make the dopamine for me to get a sort minor level up feeling in a video game.

Seriously I've made the statement to my therapist that getting the new packet feels like leveling up and crossing stuff off makes me feel better.  It's because leveling up feeling is the normal reaction that other people get doing mundane stuff.  It's the good feeling from a sense of accomplishment on the way toward a long term goal.  Thing is it helped me with anxiety and low self esteem too.  

I never felt good going to class, just dread, I never felt good after class, just relieved I'm not failing yet. If I stress about something complicated or important.  I write it down.  I will do it later.  Unlike every other time in my life, now I believe it, because it will be done later if it's on the list.

Anyway, then you do prioritization, then breaking down tasks that are big, then writing down why you are avoiding things.  The one i'm workin on giving me fits is writing down why i dont want to do things.   So darn ironic too, because if I am avoiding things I avoid writing things down, so I avoid writing down I wont do it. LOL.

It's not a silver bullet, but it helps.  I have days where I am avoiding something and the more I dont do it, the more stressed I get, then the more stressed I get the more I need to get my mind of it and do something calming...  But I can break out of that cycle by getting the list and doing some of it.  Any of it.  Once I do one thing I think, 'its not that bad just do the thing you didnt want to do' and i can do it.","d9zxemw",4,1479140119,"2016-11-14 16:15:19"

Things have to be right in front of our faces to get our attention.   I’m a huge fan of post it notes, writing on your bathroom mirror, keeping cleaning supplies in plain sight, etc.  

You can make yourself a little yellow brick road to follow.   If you go to the bathroom first thing in the morning, write the three or four things you need to do right there on the mirror.  Or use a dry erase board.  

“Don’t forget to take your meds, brush your teeth, take your vitamin and wipe down the sink.” (Of course make sure your meds and vitamins are in the bathroom!)

Maybe you always go back to the bedroom next.  Hang a big chalkboard or one of those changeable signs “take one load of launder and start the wash.”   Or whatever.  

Same in the kitchen.  Same by where you leave your shoes.  

If you had roommates that might look silly- but because you live alone you can get creative!   Make sure one list leads you to the next natural place you’ll go and a new list. 

And as much as you can - automate it!!   Do morning and evening routines as close to
The same every day as you can.  I know I know....  We prefer novelty and spontaneity.   But trust me.  If you can get to where your routines are automatic your brain will be freed up to handle so much more!!   

(Set a timer for each phase of the cleaning part of the routine.  Run to get to it before it goes off when you get something done on time.  No worries about looking silly running in the house and giving yourself a cheer!!)","g1nla1p",1,1597525876,"2020-08-15 21:11:16"

"6475","""Hyperfocus"" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD.

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

Therapy can be helpful - but you've got to find a good one.  Finding one that takes your insurance is a good start, but don't be afraid to meet with several, talk to them, see how it works out for you.  

I met with at least 8 or so different therapists, and met with three of them more than once.  I settled on two that I liked (a woman and a man), and the woman I saw more than the other.  She was great for individual therapy as well as couple's counseling.  

I don't know what your financial situation is but you may not want to limit your options simply because ""they don't take my insurance"".  The woman I saw above didn't take ANY insurance.  She was expensive, but honestly spending that money was worth it.  She was critical in helping my wife and I both understand what was wrong with our relationship and what I needed to do to fix it.

Things get better.  Keep working at it.  Keep working to improve what you don't like about yourself, and keep working to fix those issues.  Don't let the whole thing get you down - concentrate on a few small things at a time and work on tiny victories.

You might want to let your kids and your wife know that you love them and that you are trying to make things better.  Don't just say that shit, show them.

However, the point is that a chunk of all of our incomes should be taken to provide healthcare for all Americans.  For poorer people, this chunk won't amount to much as someone making $20,000 a year will not be able to finance their own healthcare costs, since even a single visit can run thousands of dollars.  

But, the wealthy do not want such a tax because 10% of their income is a lot more money than 10% of a poor persons income so they get on the defensive about it and complain about unfairness and call the poor lazy.  Let's keep it real; every single American is not born equally well off.  Some will be born into families that can afford health care and others will not be.  

It's unfair to punish those who lost the genetic lottery by condemning them to a life without access to healthcare, especially those with physical or mental handicaps.  We should be a caring society; **it shouldn't be survival of the fittest.**  ","csgsn6b",2,1435125048,"2015-06-24 05:50:48"

I'm not even sure if they believe in mental conditions at all (except for maybe Alzheimers). When I am around parents and authority figures I ""reign it in"" and hardly say anything/am very appropriate. My mum just thinks of me as kinda lazy but since I'm passing she doesn't mind it. 

It's at campus with friends (and strangers sometimes) where I pretty much let loose the first thing that enters my mind. I think many of my friends will say ""yeah of course, it makes sense"" because it explains my weird erratic energy/bouts of insanity. I used to think I was just a bit quirky and the reason I couldn't stop joking inappropriately was that I had gotten so used to it I didn't know what else to do. 

Yeah I had almost no knowledge about ADHD (I don't know how common it is in my country, but I only know of one other person with it, and I haven't really spoke to him). I have since read up a lot. I don't think my friends knew either, I doubt many of them have had experience with it. No one has ever suggested it before, and this is a class of medical students. 

Of course looking back it kinda makes sense, but the thought never crossed my mind (It wasn't even on the side of the road) until the psychiatrist asked me if I thought I had ADHD. At some point when we cover psychiatry in class they are all going to joke that it sounds like me (I'll probably tell them before then)","dmh88jo",2,1504379444,"2017-09-02 19:10:44"

But if he is deterring you away from your studies (idk what you pursuing or how long it will take) and he's putting extra stress on you then you may want to seek actual help. You cannot just bear with the pressure of this and it may cause stress for you in the long run. At the same time, I think you should be patient with him and not think that he's ruining your life because he's not. There's just a misunderstanding between you two.

"6496","I would describe it like this. When I describe things it’s really wonky so hang tight. Your brain is separate from your mind; your desires, your wants, yes? But your brain is between your mind and the material world. 

When my ADHD acts up my brain gets locked on to one channel. Imagine that channel being one activity. Like, imagine that each activity has its own little hallway in your brain at the end of which is you doing it. You decide you want to do something and then you send your little brainwave or whatever down to do it.

This is a normal person’s brain.

They can decide what they want to do. All paths are open to them.

Here is an ADHD brain.

They have doors randomly opening and closing. They can't choose what they want to do. There is one path at any given time that they are capable of doing easily and enjoyably. Trying to do anything else is like trying to ram open a door and causes real mental pain.

These doors are always opening and closing. They don't need distractions to keep going. See the the option I included all the way on the right? Yeah. Staring at the wall or laying on the floor are options. People with ADHD can just get 'stuck' staring into space. It requires a titanic amount of effort to struggle your way out of it...

What it was not on purpose? You are telling me it was an honest mistake?  Well then you feeling ashamed!  For feeling ashamed will definitely create a time machine and rewrite the past.  It will undo the unintentional mistake.

Nope it will not create a time machine and undo the past?  Feeling ashamed does nothing reparative you say?  Well then it will be probably a good idea to **forgive** yourself and try to make it up for him.  Do something nice and something awesome, and remind your boyfriend why he likes you.

***If you did not notice this post so far was tongue and cheek over the top to illustrate a point.  You made a mistake, it was not on purpose, that feeling guilty does not help but showing how sorry you are will help.***

Now do not forget I bet there are many traits that are kinda linked to your ADHD your boyfriend likes.  Maybe your passion, your spontaneity, your intensity, hell some guys like it when girls are impulsive.  Remember you have good things he likes about you too.

All you need to do is spoil him rotten and remind him that you make mistakes, but he is so worth it.

"6536","There is a lot of overlap. It seems some forms of OCD are suspected to relate to dopamine-related problems and are helped with stimulants. Plus, even though ADHD is officially associated ""impulsivity"" rather than ""compulsivity,"" I think it's common for many of us to have issues with compulsive behavior, including ADHD-PI. (Like, put plenty of thought into your actions, come to a rational decision about what choice is best, then pick the choice you know is wrong because you can't help it for some reason.)

Some of your examples sound like the sort of things people instinctively come up with to cope with ADHD symptoms. We often have issues with working memory (forgetting what you're doing in the middle of doing it), so you'll want to have tabs  and software buttons arranged in the same order when working, in order to easily click them when you need to without having to think about it or look for them. A split second of searching for a button can make you lose your train of thought, and if this happens repeatedly, it can make your work slower and very frustrating. 

Likewise, a lot of us have initiation deficit (weird urge to not do things, sometimes misleadingly called ""lack of motivation"").

I loved the idea of being able to ""create"" anything I wanted. It was intimidating at first, but the logic of it came to me pretty easily, and the classes kept it pretty simple. 

The biggest issue is letting overwhelm take over. I tend to want to take things on and assume I can do anything and everything with enough time and resources. That works fine until you're under a deadline and a giant stack of code that you're trying to figure out. However, you should be able to avoid this if you have a good project manager or technical lead ;)

I've done support, development, systems administration, planning, consulting, and project management. IT is super interesting (to me) and it's always changing. There is always some new tool that someone else made to mess around with. There's always some sort of ""challenge"" to be solved.

"6562","Yo first time commenting on reddit here. I am not any type of medical professional but I do tend to research thing I'm interested in a lot. Some things that could help that I have discovered is if you believe your meds are breaking down to fast, check out your diet. If your diet is more acidic ie. processed foods, sugar, excess protein, coffee ect consider eating more alkaline foods, which is pretty vegetables and fruits, unprocessed foods, water ect. With your body in a more alkaline state, medication breaks down slower which gives the body more time to digest it and stays longer in your system. 

A possible quick fix or helping hand is drinking 2tbsp honey, 1tbsp lemon juice with warm water and/or 2tbsp lemon juice, 1tsp bi-carb soda adding room temp or chilled water when the fizzing stops. 
While lemon and other citrus fruits are acidic, when they are digested they become alkaline.

Also high vitamin C intake can also be accountable for a shorter lifespan of stimulants in your body. 

Another thing that could possibly help is your fitness level and frequent exercise. This helps your burn of your excess energy and helps calm your mind. This can help you feel less agitated throughout the day as you won't feel like a coiled up spring ready to burst. I would suggest mediation but that can be hard to accomplish with ADHD.

"6608","I was originally diagnosed just with anxiety. This was right after rehab for alcohol, so no benzos to treat the anxiety-- but, when I was about 4 months completely sober, I was still having trouble focusing and doing anything despite my sincere efforts to the contrary. So the same psych who oversaw my rehab put me on Vyvanse and POOF, about 85% of the anxiety was gone.

All of that to say, yes they are often comorbid but at least in my experience, addressing the ADHD took care of most of the anxiety. From what I have read, professionals who are up on their stuff recommend starting with the ADHD first whenever there is a suspected comorbidity (well, acute addiction being the exception), as anxiety and depression can themselves be symptoms of ADHD in addition to being present independently (for example, folks with ADHD are less likely to be eating/sleeping/exercising right because that shit is hard to do!, which can lead to depressive symptoms.

As for what to write down, you could include some (respectable) internet research and/or a few daily logs of how you were feeling and what your sleep, eating, and other activity was like. If it's already written down and organized before you go in, you could just hand the doc the paper and not have to worry about explaining it yourself.

Good luck!!

I love how ADHD makes me constantly think, and how it makes me search for new information. I also love the hyperfocus, it allows me to retain an insane amount of information over a short period of time. This has particularly come in handy while studying for the MCAT, I would routinely study for 12 hours straight with only short breaks in between.

I don't like how it makes me impulsive, easily addicted, and unable to focus on one topic consistently. 

Just like with any other condition, it's all about managing the negative symptoms. 5 years ago I would have agreed with you, but after learning how to deal with ADHD, I have a completely different outlook. ADHD absolutely can be a gift if managed correctly.

ADHD is not a 'gift.' it is a serious and sometime debilitating disability that seriously impacts our ability to learn and function normally. Many of us fight day after day to be recognized as people who suffer from a significant disadvantage in society and constantly have our disease ignored, insulted or otherwise told it doesn't exist. 

You will need to be the advocate for your kid here and you need to teach him how to advocate for himself as well. This is a life long and very difficult challenge.

 and as long as you're in the project dead lines, take your time and fix your messups and do it again. Or do it fast and charge the full time though you worked 2hrs.

Also the pay is Decent when most of what your doing is pretty simple.

In a shorter version, I see your initial point.  But I in no way meant to suggest ADHD isn't real and meds are a gimmick.  ADHD is a real, and neurologically testable condition.  Just because I have a desire to avoid a drug that is not required to maintain my health, does not mean I am opposed to it.  Sure, there are people who without a doubt NEED the medication.  I don't believe I fall into that category.

I journal... a lot. I still struggle but journaling helps me see my current struggles and helps me really identify my problem, and in a way holds me accountable.

I write down every task I need to do. I make them small task, that way I can see what I’m doing instead of just remembering what needs to be done. I keep all notes on my desk so I can’t forget them and see them regularly.

Last, I connect my current obligations with my next major goal. Graduation(not good enough), a job(not good enough) to avoid being dependent on someone else. That’s me though, everyone’s is different.

I am out the door by 6:20.

"6730","Hey, psych grad student here. Working memory deficits (as measured by cognitive tests) are more common in ADHD, but not everyone with ADHD has them. You can absolutely have ADHD without performing badly at working memory tasks, like mental arithmetic.

Working memory is the ability to hold and manipulate information in short-term memory. Short-term memory just holds information, for maybe up to a minute. It relies on ""rehearsal"", like when you repeat a phone number over and over in your head while walking to the phone. Once you stop rehearsing the phone number, it's pretty much gone from short-term memory.

If you have a short-term memory problem, you would also have problems with working memory tasks, because these tasks manipulate the information held in short-term memory. If you can't hold information in short-term memory, you can't manipulate it, so you can't do working memory tasks.

The problems you're describing are more like ""intermediate-term"" memory problems. I think it involves some similar processes to long-term memory, like storage, encoding, and retrieval of information. So a disruption at any stage could result in a memory problem.

Naturally, attention problems can disrupt memory processes. You can't remember something you didn't attend to in the first place, and distractions can interrupt short-term memory and thus working memory. So inattention from ADHD can interfere with various sorts of memory.

In a controlled environment, like taking a math test in a quiet classroom, you only have to attend to one thing, so you can use your memory skills well. In the outside world, you usually have more distractions, thus more interruptions to memory processes. Also, you often do multiple things at once, like driving + remembering to buy gas. Once this happens, you're dividing your attention. If you have a problem with divided attention (might be common in ADHD?), this is also going to interfere with your ability to remember to buy gas.

Here is a paper that shows what percentage of high-IQ adults have working memory and other executive functioning deficits:

"6753","I second what other redditors said: research better, write a convincing piece, and make sure your professor knows the literature they're using isn't only outdated, but also holding on to harmful stereotypes. Remember one thing: rage and spite make one hell of a motivation to get stuff done.

First thing. Attributing things to others' ""character"" or ""will"" is a moralistic stance that does nothing but pat the ego of those making such assumptions and shame those who need help but know they can't ask by fear of being considered lesser. It's an attitude that refuses to see difficulties and assumes only one kind of experience is valid (like saying that accessibility fuels laziness when it actually helps those with mobility and sensory issues). 

Second thing. THERE IS BETTER LITERATURE ON ADHD. Dr. Russell Barkley, for instance.

Third thing. A doctor should not and cannot assume the easiest explanation for a patient's problems is ""it's the patient's fault"" when there is an actual medical explanation. And even when it could be considered the patient's fault, like a chronic smoker getting lung and heart issues, or an alcoholic having liver issues (arguably *not even those* are the patient's fault, given the addictive potential of nicotine and alcohol, and how there's a link between addiction and self-medicating for a problem they usually don't know they have)... they're usually not refused treatment.

Fourth thing. Not to be That Person, but being that person, using the expression ""gays"" when referring to gay folks is usually a big red flag that it's not a very scientific opinion, but rather one founded in prejudice. 

Fifth thing. Perpetuating outdated and prejudiced points of view is detrimental to your education and that of your classmates.","fymojbp",2,1595220356,"2020-07-20 04:45:56"

To answer your question you dont *need* insurance to buy your meds, you only need a prescription from a doctor. However some meds are quite expensive I believe brand name Concerta to be especially pricey. There are other options that are cheaper, however. 

As for finding a doctor, that will also be expensive without insurance. The cheapest thing I can think of for you to do is to visit an urgent care facility or a hospital, have all of your past medical records transferred there, and just explain your situation. 

This will still be very costly without insurance but I believe there are some programs that can help you pay for things like that. Depending on your income, you may qualify for Medicaid.

"6808","My advice would be to  pick a modern popular language that has a large active community like Java/Scala/pyhton/ruby and try to get comfortable with that. The reason for this is that getting help is easy, which means less documentation for you to read. And jumping between languages is very confusing in the beginning. (It was to me anyway)

By doing something simple, like writing a text only hangman game, you will learn essential skills like creating data structures and iterating over them. Controlling the flow of you program based on variables and user input. And you will have a chance to get the basics into your hands. And that's a great starting point. 

When you are happy with it, add a way to store data in a DB like a scoreboard. Then maybe try to get a user interface going. Maybe add multiple players? How about to players on different machines?

Complexity will increase all the time. So for learning I say keep it simple at first the add stuff until it breaks. It's a nice way to learn. And going back before it's to late is a good skill. 

And when you feel that your done. When it's good enough. *Do it again in a different programming language.* This is essential. This might be one of the things that have thought me the most about programming in general. 

But, this is one out of many ways to approach this. Whichever you choose; good luck :) ","cs0k6qv",1,1433857954,"2015-06-09 13:52:34"

"6899","I have some dont's, although they may not apply to your situation since my childhood was kinda weird :P

Don't expect your kid to understand ""obvious"" things, especially if you've never explained it to them/explained it to them a long time ago.

For instance: I was hella forgetful and my dad would always say ""Just write it down"", but to me, that didn't make sense. Why would I write something down when I'd just lose the paper? 

What I didn't get was the concept of ""have a to-do list in one place and write your to-do's only in that place"". If my dad had handed me a notebook and said ""This is for writing down all the things you need to do today. Keep it on your desk at all times"", I probably would have listened. 

Conceptual learning might be hard in general. When I did martial arts (which I highly, highly recommend), my teacher would show a move and then expect us to be able to apply that move to multiple situations. That was always hard for me. I function much better when I'm given a detailed list of things to accomplish. Otherwise, there's too much leeway and I end up haring off on some tangentially related subject.


Singing is good, if your kid likes music. I started singing in a choir when I was 4 and didn't stop until I was 18 (I still sing, I just don't perform). It's one of those things that kind of forces you to develop coping strategies for the wiggles/twitches/boredom, especially if your music teacher has A Look and A Sharp Wit to match. 

And also, talk to your kid. Ask them questions about why they do or don't like something. Ask them why they did that dumb/annoying/rude thing they did. They might not know the answer, but you can use the opportunity to help them come up with a different option. For most of my childhood and teenage years, I felt like I was some half-feral beast, because I never seemed to be able to act socially appropriately. I was too loud, too quiet, too wiggly, too still...and even though I could tell that I was doing something wrong, I never quite knew what it was or how to fix it. Then again, this might be more a ""Dire's family was hella weird"" rather than an ADHD thing. ","d8qqbzs",3,1476389285,"2016-10-13 20:08:05"

"6911","I know it’s not easy, but try to pick a regular study time and stick to it. At first it sucks and you want to die, but once it becomes a habit it really makes things easier. Your brain gets adapted to doing the unpleasant thing. And you adapt way faster than you think you’re going to, because adhd memory—we do something for a week and we *feel* like we’ve done it forever right? I find same goes for new habits.

Also try to make the task more “close-ended.” “Studying” is scary and overwhelming cause there’s no clearly defined start and end point. Instead of that, either pick a time limit that feels reasonable (I’m gonna study for 20 minutes), and/or be more specific about the task (I’m gonna make flash cards if 10 key terms and review them, or I’m gonna read and highlight this chapter). 

Keep breaking the task down till it feels manageable, if it’s still overwhelming then you didn’t break it down enough. Who cares if that means you get down to “I’m gonna read one paragraph,” if that’s where your brain is at then that’s where it’s at, you know?

Plus, the more concrete it is, the more you get that dopamine boost from “I did it.” We just need that dopamine more regularly than people without adhd to keep going, so chunking tasks gives us that sense of accomplishment we need to keep going.

And when I remember to do it, journaling about a) why I’m procrastinating, and b) all the good feelings I’ll have when I finish a task helps me. When we’re procrastinating, we’re fixated on the crappy parts. It’ll be boring, stressful, whatever. The trick is to refocus on what will feel good about doing the thing. Writing it down helps really process it too.

 [**Pomodoro Technique**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro%20Technique): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Pomodoro Technique__ is a [time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.  The technique uses a [timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timer) to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as ""pomodori"", the plural of the [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language) word *pomodoro* for ""[tomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato)"".  The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.  

&gt;Closely related to concepts such as [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) and [iterative and incremental development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) used in software design, the method has been adopted in [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) contexts.

"6918","""Hyperfocus"" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD.

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

"6955","TL;DR I'm a Mexican-American female, currently in-progress with a diagnosis at 24yo, so I don't know the black+adhd experience, but here's mine:

Growing up I was technically a good student. Got decent grades, retained a lot from lecture, but I rarely ever put effort into it. I was messy and disorganized. Especially compared to the other students in my honors/AP classes, the majority of whom were Asian (the whole school was evenly mixed between Asian/PI, Hispanic/Latino, and Black/African-American).

I had mostly Caucasian teachers in high school and all the teachers who gave me well-meant talks about getting my shit together were white, so I think I definitely internalized some Stereotype Threat without that ever being their intention.

At community college though, most of my professors were women of color, and they were brilliant, professional, organized, and inspiring. When I floundered towards the end of my time there, I think the stereotype threat was mostly gone and I had internalized the frustration and shame to be directed at myself only.

"6961","Ohio is one of the most helpful tips in the book ""Driven to Distraction"". I've started using it for all my school stuff and out makes all the difference.

The citation goes in the bibliography and the quote goes in my paper along with an in text citation. Then I allow myself to move on and do more research or talk about that quote. 

Since I started that system I almost never have to go back and look at my sources again. I can find new things or finish much more easily.

Ohio also helps with mail. I don't open my mailbox unless I'm ready to handle anything on in it. Yes, there are times where I don't check the mail for weeks, but when I do check it I am able to throw away the junk and properly respond the the rest.

Yeah, in my experience the ADHD is permanent and the depression hopelessness is temporary (albeit chronic). I know there's a comorbidity between ADHD and depression, but I think they're fairly distinct, and it doesn't surprise me that you're still struggling with the depression side of things despite the ADHD meds.

I was in a pretty dark place last winter. The doctor put me onto a CBT therapist and that helped a lot - have you tried CBT? They basically got me doing really common sense things I'd stopped prioritising (exercise, rest &amp; sunlight were probably the biggest ones I'd neglected).

"6978","I know the feeling. The minutia of every day life is overwhelming sometimes. It can get better though. Not perfect, but definitely better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding food, cooking, etc - first off, there's nothing saying you have to eat 3 meals a day. It's not a rule, it's just kind of how we usually grow up thinking we're ""supposed"" to eat. But it's totally not necessary. As long as you're getting adequate calories/nutrients it doesn't matter to your body whether you eat 3 meals or just one or what time of day you eat or anything like that. Food is fuel.

&amp;#x200B;

About the groceries, I totally feel you there. There's too many choices, too much information, it's overload. So the easiest way to deal with that is to eliminate some of the choices and simplify things. Focus your meals on protein and produce. So shop around the edge of the store, get you some meat/protein you like, some sort of produce to go with it, and maybe some fruit or dairy if you're feeling fancy. Buy yourself one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Granite-Ware-18-Inch-Covered-Roaster/dp/B000050AVC), put your veggies in the bottom, your meat on top or in the middle, salt, pepper, spices if you like them, and then stick that sucker in the oven for an hour or 2. Super easy, low effort tasty meal. Even better if you make a LARGE batch, and then you have meals for the next two or three days and don't have to cook again until then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Simplifying where ever possible is the key to dealing with this shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Little routines help as well. For example, the teeth thing, make it a point to always brush your teeth right after you get out of the shower. Morning, afternoon, whenever you take a shower, right then as soon as you get your naked self out of the shower, brush your teeth. After you it a while, the brain will just go on autopilot and you'll find yourself doing it without having to try so hard to remember to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Take a look at your environment too. Is it cluttered and full of crap you don't really need? If so, take baby steps to get rid of all that junk. That stuff weighs on you mentally and emotionally. And just fucking looking at it sometimes is exhausting. Like where to even start?! It's paralyzing, exactly like what you're describing. And it makes you feel like shit -  like you just keep asking yourself ""why is all of this so damn hard?"", and then it just goes downhill from there. But it is fixable, in tiny little 5 minute doses. Carve out small spaces for yourself, just a little bit at a time, like one day make sure your bed is cleaned off, and then the next day pick up the clothes off the floor, just one little step, one little five minute window of activity at a time. It's much more doable and less overwhelming when you think to yourself, ""Well I only have to pay attention to this for five minutes"" than if you're thinking, ""Oh god this is going to take hours"" because then of course we don't want to get started and nothing gets done. 

&amp;#x200B;

And you can do the same thing with the driving. It doesn't have to be a lot, just little windows of practive here and there. Start by driving around the block. Or just practice reversing down the driveway a few times until it starts to feel more comfortable. Like all the rest of it, it doesn't have to be a huge effort, just little ones that you stick with more or less over time.

&amp;#x200B;

And forgive yourself when you forget something. It's going to happen. The thing to tell yourself is that just because you fucked up doesn't mean you ARE a fuck up. You're just an imperfect human being like the rest of us, and from time to time you're not going to live up to everything you expect from yourself. That's ok though. That's just being a person.","enc516t",11,1557760895,"2019-05-13 15:21:35"

Yes fish oil is not cheap, but I take it as a part of my daily routine that seems to help me overall (based on my own personal observations of differences when I run out).  =P  I wasn't denouncing flaxseed oil per se, but attempting to point out that it might not be helping significantly, in which case it's more expensive than none at all.  ;-)  Also, cheaper pills don't always mean more Omega-3s.  I've seen fish pills that cost the same and one kind had one half the EPA/DHA as the other, although they had the same 'fish oil' content, and thus listed their recommended dose as two pills.  The other kind only recommended one pill, so it was actually cheaper *per dose*.

"6997","I use outlook and Microsoft apps for my business, so I have it set up so that me CRM, outlook to do and outlook calendar all talk to each other. The same to do list is on all devices, iPads, phone, computers. I put every single thing on my to do list or calendar. As far as I am concerned, if it’s not on there, it probably won’t get done. 

The added benefit is I rarely forget things, because everything is on a list.

My to do list also gets out of control. I use categories, “Business”, “Short Term”, “Daily” etc. 

Part of my morning ritual is to spend time organizing my agenda for the day using my various lists and my calendars. 

If I don’t do this first thing, I’m just sort of winging it for the rest of the day as my list is too long to sort through on the go.

Microsoft’s to do app for iPhone has a “daily agenda” feature. So I will sort through all of my tasks and anything that needs to be done that day goes on my daily agenda page. I make sure that gets done and any other extra time is used working on the other stuff. 

You want to make everything external. I even externalize my motivation as well (thank you Dr Barkley) and im surprised how well it works. Also part of my morning ritual is to find one new, motivating and inspiring quote and to print it out and hang it in my office. I have my goals printed and posted in my office. I externalize my daily goals as well, and my focus is on the activity and goals needed each day to simplify, simplify and to keep the three Rs together.

"7000","Yeah, personally I think all that preppy stuff is for young people. It might be helpful for them. I don't know. I was diagnosed at age 30. 

It was not helpful for me, because it wasn't constructive, and saying things like ""you're a hunter"" or ""your mind is so creative"" is more limiting than perhaps intended, because I have strengths that are not classically attributed to people with ADHD. My whole self isn't limited to ADHD. Richard Branson and Michael Phelps, both excelling in their fields, didn't get there because of ADHD, they got there because they are not limited to their ADHD. 

I personally don't like to think of it as disabled or disordered either, which might be confusing, because I don't see it as us being *unable* to do something, we just have trouble *regulating*, it seems more of a quantitative difference rather than a qualitative one. It's even been said that we don't have a deficit in attention and it's a bad term, for we can produce attention to things that we like, so it's more the case that we have trouble regulating it. Still, it can be managed. 

So I'm not gifted and I'm not disabled, whilst I agree that I have more difficulties with my executive functions, I recognised that it's aggravated to the point of dysfunction only when things around me are not adjusted to meet my ADHD needs, or if I've mentally given up self-belief. When I think about it carefully, I see that ADHD doesn't completely rule anything out for me, it just may not go in the classic way or time frame. I don't know it that makes sense, but I just don't see it as so black and white. I don't see it as a gift or as a disability; I see challenge but not impossibility.

"7008","Since others answered your question very thoroughly, I'll add some other things: I did my Masters in NL and was diagnosed with ADHD during my study. *But* I got my diagnosis in the US when I went back to my home state to visit during the summer. 

Then, when I returned to NL, I gave the original document of my diagnosis and prescription to my Dutch GP to copy for his records and so he could authorize my prescription refills.

Backstory complicated TL;DR: I always had depression and anxiety issues but my mom thought ADHD wasn't real. My mom died unexpectedly from cancer and later I decided to get tested for ADHD. 

A Dutch friend of mine also has ADHD, but he said it was expensive and difficult to be diagnosed in NL. Hence why I did it back in the US as my fee was a $20 copay only. Still was paying for insurance in the US.

Per acceptability: ADHD is recognized a legit disability in NL. Though I can't say for certain how others feel about it socially. The main reason being, I am skeptical in talking with others about my ADHD as I don't want to share that I take medication. 

Per university: From my experience (not speaking on behalf of *all* universities in NL) the university I attended for my Masters did a shit job bureaucratically providing accommodations during testing. 

Yes, they provided me with extra time, but not a separate room to take my exam undistracted (which they initially said they offered) Instead I took the test in a room with everyone else who had a disability of some sort. Each time I took an exam, I had to request special accommodation *every* single time. So, 8+ times.

One time the online ""accommodation request"" system messed up and said I didn't send a request before the deadline (7 days before the exam) when I did. The receptionist reprimanded me for ""Not thinking ahead / being more prepared"" ... So yeah, super nice when you have ADHD.

Anyway, I'm sure other universities are more organized nowadays.

Per prescriptions:

On the plus side, instead of getting 1-month refill at a time as in the US, I can get 3-month batches. This is very convenient especially if I misplace a bottle at home. 

On the downside, when I was on Dutch student insurance, they just decided at random to stop paying for my medication because my ADHD was a preexisting condition.... But now I have proper Dutch insurance (*Basisverzekering*) and this is no longer an issue.

"7013","In my experience, caffeine is different for me than for others.  Much like prescribed stimulants, it's relaxing and kind of settling.  It definitely helps my symptoms.  I self-medicated with soda and coffee+sugar drinks all the way through school.  But it doesn't make me feel wide awake.  And I've never felt ""wired"" like some people describe from caffeine drinks.  The only time I've ever felt ""jittery"" is when I took my vyvanse and it kicked in right as the caffeine from a relatively large coffee kicked in.  And even hat only happened once.  I have no scientific research showing it, but my husband and I both have adhd, and we both experience these kind of ""wrong"" effects from caffeine.  Given that people with ADHD often describe the effects of stimulants as calming, I wouldn't be surprised if there is a connection.

Daytime sleepiness has been a lifelong struggle for me, and caffeine never really made me feel awake.  Vyvanse does, though.  Also, when on vyvanse, caffeine seems to have a more ""normal"" effect on me.

All that said, if you think that you may have adhd, you should try to see a doctor about it.  There are a lot of things that can be done to help.","d7ly7h5",3,1473822504,"2016-09-14 03:08:24"

"7059","Another childish thing about me is I'm often needlessly stubborn about stupid things, which you've probably already noticed haha.

I think our descriptions overlap in some aspects, however I also feel like there's a fine line between, for example, being open/direct and being rude/inappropriate. Same with my other points, might be due to the difference in how those things manifest from person to person, or maybe I just lack experience in managing my symptoms better so it bothers me more because I feel trapped and not in control.

I guess it also depends on whether those things have helped or harmed you in life, for me the latter would be the case so the notion that I should accept/appreciate/like those things for me is akin to smelling a turd hoping it'll start smelling like violets – as much as I realize that ADHD won't go away (a rather disappointing realization I keep having several times a week whenever I wonder why I'm like this and when this is going to stop, and then it's like, *oh*, it's *never* going to stop, sweet...), that doesn't make me any more able to appreciate things that I strongly dislike and that have caused me to sabotage my own life every step of the way.

This went way off topic lmao but actually this whole thing isn't even as much about other people's opinions. Other people pointing out the things I hate about myself to me just means it's bad enough that others can notice too, not just me (doesn't tend to affect personal relationships that well either...). So all it really does is draw my attention even more to the flaws that I already know I have, ultimately it's only how I feel about myself and my own life that matters to me, although I certainly don't want to leave the impression of a trash can on fire on other people.

I guess what I'm trying to say is it only makes sense to me to frame those things negatively because they're hindering me in life. I don't know if it's just my immaturity showing or what but I see no reason to view myself in a positive light in relation to my failures or to see good sides in them when there aren't any. It seems like those of us who were able to make it to a good place in life despite their ADHD start viewing certain aspects of their ADHD as positives, but for those of us who're struggling as a direct result of out ADHD, that positivity sort of falls on deaf ears, or at least I don't seem to ever be able to relate to it.

"7061","Hi, Psychiatrists can prescribe medication but Psychologists cannot. 

You can ask your Psychologist to give you a referral to a Psychiatrist if you are wanting to pursue medication. They can do this and should be able to send you over with a case report along the lines of ""X results appear to be consistent with those of ADHD. X would like to pursue medication"". 

Your psychologist can help equip you with behaviour tools to cope with and manage your ADHD as medication isn't a be all and end all (not to say it can't have a great impact!). 

Most importantly your psychologist can also help treat any other issues that may be co-morbid and occurring with / as a result of / independently to your ADHD such as your  anxiety and depression. 

Psychiatrist = physical (meds)

Psychologist = scientific approach to mental health

Unfortunately there is no ""quick fix"" but your Psychologist is a healing partner and should be able to assist your healing and growth. If you can, I recommend trying to communicate with your psychologist and ask to clarify what your session goals are. They may be focussing on the depression / anxiety whereas you may be focussing on the ADHD. It's important you guys are on the same page so don't be afraid to let them know you are feeling like there isn't much direction.

"7125","I can't be sure what you were experiencing and can only take a guess as a non-clinical-professional internet stranger. That said:

I do know that we will experience a range of what we might call ""states of ability"": sometimes your brain cooperates and acts normal, sometimes the stars align and your brain just hands you everything you could possibly need, and sometimes your brain refuses even the most basic task. This is part of why ADHD is not taken as seriously: just as a depressed person has normal days and especially bad days, so do we with ADHD. 

If you have ADHD, and if we go with Occam's Razor, you were simply in a state where your brain refused to focus on or maintain anything to do with the class. Following a conversation and keeping the core details in mind is a job for our working memory, which is typically quite impaired in people with ADHD ([1](https://psy.fsu.edu/clc/Publications/Orban2017.pdf) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7318097/) [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7483636/)). This is why ADHD is associated with things like [reading comprehension difficulties](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/hbm.24552) (which you seem to experience), and [difficulties keeping up with lessons or conversations.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919309437)

*That* said, ADHD is a very heterogenous disorder. For example, I personally have no problems with reading comprehension or following conversations/lessons, only with actually listening or actually sitting down to read. This was very frustrating for my teachers in school because I'd fidget constantly and get up or stare out the window, and then answer difficult questions about content 10 minutes ago correctly. I wouldn't do or turn in my work, I'd disrupt class, and I'd get in trouble on the playground, but I would do well on tests and I would answer any question asked of me. But even with that ""symptom profile"", I did have my bad days where it was like my brain was asleep while I was awake and I couldn't do anything at all. I still struggle with occasional days or times like that.

Other students with ADHD at that school were completely different - one was angry/violent and bashed my head with a rock because I was digging a hole too close to his, for example; I never had problems with excessive anger, just excessive exuberance and impulsive behaviour.

All that is to say that if you have ADHD, your experience will be in some ways unique to you; there are simply too many genetic factors involved, too many symptoms and - more importantly - too many *sources of those symptoms* for any one-size-fits-all answer. It's important to find out how to disorder manifests in you and what those effects are. It does sound like you've already started.","gqkbgvl",1,1615463752,"2021-03-11 11:55:52"

I think any inpatient care center can call itself a ""psych ward,"" even if it's not attached to a reputable hospital or other medical institution. And even within a given psych ward, there's significant variation in the competency of the people who work there. The kind of people who think they can diagnose someone just by watching them for a couple hours a day (especially when those hours are in unfamiliar surroundings) are not, IME, the people who are qualified to do this.

Also, gonna go out on a limb here and say that if someone is getting inpatient psychiatric treatment, they've got issues other than ADHD, and even an actual, trained psychiatrist with a degree probably can't tell if someone is trying to climb the bookshelves because of ADHD, a manic episode, a medication side effect from an unfortunate choice of antidepressant, or just because someone said there was a cinnamon roll on top of the bookcase, and they're bored and hungry.

"7150","Get this book: [The Mindfulness Prescription for Adult ADHD by Lidia Zylowska, M.D.](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Prescription-Adult-ADHD-Strengthening/dp/1590308476/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=The+Mindfulness+Prescription+for+Adult+ADHD&amp;qid=1591114984&amp;sr=8-2) It's awesome. Mindfulness practice (and lots of great information) geared toward people with ADHD.

I've found that the needs for an organizational system are *highly individualistic*. Like you, I've tried lots of different apps, journals, etc. I found what works best for me is a combination of the Reminders app on my iPhone, and Bear journal, both powered and automated by several iOS Shortcuts that I've created and/or downloaded and modified. My biggest problem has always been, whatever system I was using (to-do list, post it notes, etc.) that I'd forget to look at it to be reminded of what I needed to do! Even auto notifications weren't enough.

I started using the Reminders app, because you can set a day/time reminder to pop up, or location-based reminder (""remind me when I get home""), but the notification is one quick vibration or sound (I usually have my phone set to vibrate so I don't disturb those around me), and I'd miss it or even if I noticed it, if I wasn't in a position to pull out my phone I'd forget two seconds later, and it doesn't go off again. 

So I created a simple iOS shortcut with a button on my home screen (so I don't have to be bothered to navigate to the app and find the Shortcut that I want to run) that prompts me to enter something I need to be reminded of (either by voice dictation or text), then prompts me for a date/time for when to set the reminder to be scheduled, then sets an audible alarm for the same time, with the same name as the reminder. When the time rolls around, my alarm goes off and I have no choice but to get my phone out to silence (or snooze) it. If at that moment I'm not prepared to complete the task, I can easily set a new reminder.   


The other thing I use is a Shortcut created my someone else that prompts for several different text (or voice) inputs in different categories that I've modified or created, then formats a journal entry template in the Bear app that I can then open on my MacBook Pro and complete. The journal entry includes mindfulness practice and reminders for work and personal to-dos. I can also choose to thumb-enter it on my iPhone if I don't have my MBP with me. There I can add thoughts, make to-do lists, etc. I made a separate shortcut (tied into a Daily Morning Routine shortcut that I run automatically every morning) that creates reminders with alarms for 4 times during the day to run the Bear journal shortcut, as well as remind me to take my medications, automatically sets a reminder with an alarm for the afternoon dose, shows me my calendar and Reminders, and then opens a few apps on my phone that need daily updates (fitness and work stuff). Finally, it gives me the option to open my news app and/or Reddit if I have time to browse.

I've embraced automation as much as I can. It's the only way (in addition to Adderall☺️) I can remember the things I need to do **at the right time and place**. iOS Shortcuts aren't perfect, but with a little time and patience, you can learn to create shortcuts to automate so many things. There's a [Shortcuts community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts) with lots of really smart &amp; creative people (some of whom are programmers &amp; developers), who create some really fantastic and useful shortcuts. Some have evolved into paid apps that have tons more functionality.

Again, this is what works for me after an *exhaustive* search over years for a system that I'll actually use. I've come to depend on it. 

If you use an iPhone and are interested in seeing any of the shortcuts I use or want to talk or get more info, feel free to DM.

"7151","I respectfully disagree with you. I thought I was doing pretty well in day-to-day life, just couldn't swing school all that well. The driving force behind getting diagnosed was wanting to go back to school.

It's really improved my overall quality of life, even in areas where I thought I had no issue. 

Now that I'm used to taking meds, it can definitely seem like I'm useless all day if I skip.

"7157","Sorry that I didn't respond quicker Prof. If I'm honest the response to this overwhelmed me a little, and I didn't know exactly how to engage with it again.

I mentioned that I'm new to this community, so my advice comes with the caveat that I am no expert. I had avoided dealing with my ADHD for over a decade, and I only started actively tackling it since turning 30. As a result, most of the strategies I use were developed out of necessity in the years before I sought treatment. 

That's enough throat-clearing for now. I use two strategies for avoiding intrusive thoughts like the ones described. They are idea logging (referred to by Bullet Journalists as ""rapid logging"") and time-blocking. They both address slightly different problems, so I'll explain them separately.

Idea logging is exactly as it sounds. When I have an idea, or a task, or a goal, or even a useless notion, I write it down in one place. I used to get anxious whenever I would have one of these thoughts, since they were reinforcing the idea that I was behind or that I wasn't getting to what was needed. Now, when one pops into my head, I either log it there and then, or note to myself that it is already logged. I learned, some time after starting idea logging, that this is the core skill of mindfulness; noticing and acknowledging thoughts without actively engaging them. I am not built for meditating, and I believe this is a useful alternative. 

Some practical advice on this; don't curate your log in the beginning. If you only write down tasks, you'll end up with a horrifying to-do list. Write every piece of crap that runs through your head. This will cheapen the list so it doesn't feel like a thing to deal with, which is what you want. 2) If this works for you for a month, consider leaning into Bullet Journaling. It's a way of turning this process into an organiser. Just watch the original videos and don't google outside of that. Most people use it as an art project, which is great, but it's overwhelming if you are like me.

Time-blocking deals with the problem you outlined; thinking about the task you are not doing, which interrupts the task that you are doing, which means that neither task gets done. The idea is pretty simple: Use the times when you are feeling at your best to decide what you are going to do and when you are going to do it. This might sound ever bit as daunting, but I'll give a (disgracefully long-winded) explanation of why I think it works well for me.

Intrusive thoughts like these nearly ruined my life in my twenties. I dropped out of college, lost a job, and failed in business primarily due to them. It was a feature of my life for long enough for me to develop a fear of choosing tasks, which doubled-down on the problem.

I don't believe that this is an issue that is exclusive to ADHDers. I actually think that this is why so many people believe that ADHD is so relatable for them, even if they aren't affected by it. The difference is that the strategies that work for average folks are toxic for us.

Specifically, avoid strategies that attempt to increase motivation. You likely don't need to. My motivation was not, and is not, as malleable as other people's, and trying to control or shape it caused me enormous harm. Perceived lack of motivation, or being unable to harness what I had, made me feel like a failure.

The thing is, I am very motivated. If you've ever sat at your desk for 12 hours not doing your work, you are motivated. If you weren't, you wouldn't be at your desk in the first place. It's certainly not discipline keeping you there. The problem, for me at least, is that using my motivation to get me to my desk was a waste. It is an unpredictable asset for ADHDers. It comes at unexpected intervals, often in enormous waves. It can even come at inconvenient times (see all-nighters researching the colonisation of Mars for no specific reason). 

Whenever you get a burst of energy, use it to set yourself up for a few extra wins. Figure out a small number of tasks that are actually important, and write down when you are going to do them. I think it helps if you have known ""slots"" for different types of tasks. I pick slots that have unavoidable triggers rather than fixed times, so I know where I'll be (e.g. when I first open my laptop in work, on the walk home, immediately after getting in the door). This means that high-motivated-me has confirmed that this is the right task, so when low-motivated-me thinks of something else, he can log it and get back to work.

Motivation is fixed, but discipline is trainable. Discipline building is an ongoing process for me, and progress comes slowly but noticeably. Be generous to yourself while you try any of these things. Celebrate the small wins and expect the small failures. Start immediately, but start small. Stopping sucks but it happens, and restarting is a big win. Add new strategies when you feel able. Scrap strategies when they no longer work. Novelty is powerful, so don't be embarrassed if you are continuously jumping on new band-wagons.

I hope there is some value in this for you Prof. If nothing else, at nearly a thousand words it's a shining example of what happens when an ADHDer suddenly becomes over-motivated.

"7163","I usually feel uneasy and uncomfortable around most people who self diagnose because I associate them with people using mental disorders as just adjectives to describe themselves like someone else in the replies mentioned. I see it often with other mental disorders too, like OCD and bipolar disorder to name a few, which is frustrating because to me, these people are making mental disorder seem less severe than it actually is. I’ve seen people say that it seems like everyone is mentally ill online, and that they think that mental health related vocabulary is just becoming buzzwords, and I think this is largely due to people throwing around names of disorders as adjectives.  

I agree that I do think that it’s okay to self diagnose for financial reasons though, and even with my initial uneasiness, I feel much better once I know that the person researched thoroughly and actually do know the severity of the disorder they are self diagnosing as. Also, basically all people who I know that self diagnose for financial reasons make it clear that they would like to seek professional help once they are financially stable and able to, but people who self diagnose without research seem to not want to do this. 

I also think another circumstance where self diagnosis may be reasonable is for certain personal reasons that someone might not be comfortable with talking about it yet. 

I really dislike admitting it, but I fit under this. I’m diagnosed with ADHD and dyscalculia, but I tell some people that I trust that I think that I have symptoms of PTSD even though I’m not diagnosed.  I’ve been struggling with extreme traumatic memories and flashbacks, as well as a lot of other issues, every day for months ever since the event that caused it, but I’m too scared to bring up my trauma to my psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ADHD, and also in part because I don’t want my parents to know that I went through a traumatic event as well. 

I can understand if others feel similarly, and honestly, in my case at least, it’s pretty easy to tell when you have extreme trauma even without a diagnosis for PTSD because it makes living day to day so much harder compared to how it was before the event. I would imagine that it’s similar for any other disorder and that people likely can tell that something is clearly wrong with them and interfering with their lives since that’s what makes it a disorder, the fact that it’s hard to live a typical life due to it.","g1de99g",1,1597353331,"2020-08-13 21:15:31"

Still don’t necessarily feel anything, just my head is clear and I can focus on just about anything I want, even things that are normally boring.

I’ve tried taking higher doses, up to 80 mg (when I thought it wasn’t working. I don’t support recreational use or anything) I felt on edge and ready to go. Like I could do anything I put my mind to...sat there and played videogames the whole time...

From what I’ve read of other people’s experiences, a lot seem to experience more side effects when the dose is too high for them.

It's also primarily for depression and not anxiety (as opposed to an ssri/snri which tend to treat both) although it can help with anxiety too. The TLDR is that a week just isn't enough time to know the full effects. Wait it out till your next appt, keep track of how you're doing, remember this is all a process. If it doesn't start helping, that's okay, you'll find something that does.

In one hour, I can feel 3 different ways about a topic or a part of my life. Let's call that part of my life my Budgeting Skills, and let's say the three ways are: 
1) satisfied, understanding about my frustration when it comes to budgeting, but head is higher and i know it's all a huge learning curve
2) bitter, sickeningly angry. Maybe I am full of self-hate because I am having such a hard time with ""normal things"". Maybe I am feeling extremely emotionally ill, full of inward rage, disgusted with myself, etc
3) another state of thinking in this hour could be of the ""dude! who cares! you don't need to know anything, man. Live!""

And these three places may change, rapidly, due to my judgements in a head that is very loud and moving very fast. 

My opinions about myself, the world, a piece of art, my abilities, a person in my life, will be vastly different than perhaps a few minutes ago.

I was diagnosed with ADHD very recently (at 24/25!) but I used to box as a kid and had no idea that it was actually a medication for me the whole time. Boxing was the one place I felt peace. I think it's great for someone with ADHD because you reap the rewards without having to learn too much, or focus on other people. You can walk in a gym and hit a punch bag over and over and not have to think about alot besides getting out that excess energy and tension. Then, as you become more experienced and your skill level gradually gets higher, you learn to focus, train intelligently, and of course you learn self discipline and self control. I've done alot of training in combat sports as I'm a big MMA fan so my opinion is probably very biased! 

One thing I'm grateful for that my Mum did for me, is that everytime i told her i wanted to try a sport, she'd encourage me even though she knew it was probably a phase haha so I think the best thing you can do is let him experiment with EVERYTHING, when you find whats right I'm sure you'll know :) I wish you the best!","d2cqfxt",2,1461302652,"2016-04-22 05:24:12"

In reality I'm just not climbing all over the couch but for some reason to her that means I'm depressed. (I'm 21, and I mean literally this quite literally because one day I didn't take my meds and I ended up just climbing on this counter area in my house and my mom told me I seemed happier...)

Any symptoms that are quite obvious indicators of ADHD my mom completely dismisses and just says ""oh, but you were always like that"".

She calls me out on typical ADHD things but when I explain how it's related to ADHD she doesn't accept the connection. 

Sometimes I don't understand how she still choses to deny that the medication is working/ that I have it when she essentially tells me I have all the aspects of it just doesn't chose to see it as part of ADHD. And I constantly get told off for it. But I am doing better and I am a lot happier and so even though she doesn't believe me or whatever I know this is what is helping me and it doesn't really matter what she says because she's confirmed that I have had symptoms since I was tiny she just choses to attribute it to my personality and not ADHD.

I really implore you to find better, healthier coping mechanisms. I've found that exercise gave me everything alcohol promised and never delivered.

ADHDers are more prone to addiction. Alcohol is addictive even to neurotypical people. 

So using it as you are, to feel better when you are frustrated and upset or to improve your mood, is a terrible, terrible road to go down that will end up in alcoholism. It is a horrible cycle where you drink to feel better without realizing that it is alcohol itself that is slowly dragging your baseline lower and lower. You feel bad all the time so you drink to feel better, not realizing it's the alcohol itself making you feel bad. Add in the fact that ADHDers already have dopamine problems and ethanol is physically addictive and you've got a recipe for alcoholism.

I did eventually get over that--not completely, I'm still fundamentally an awkward person but I have more confidence and less intense anxiety now that I'm an adult and not a teenager.  Teens have it rough. Teens' emotions can be overboard but your perspective is likely still limited by limited life experience.  Once you start gaining new experiences (and get jaded and annoyed), you shed some of that teen aura of constant worry.

Interacting with people in a context that was new for me helped me shed my teen insecurity: study abroad b/c no one knows anything about you so it's a nice blank slate, and also work.  Every job I've had has been really tough the first few months but then you get used to what you're doing and that helps build self esteem.

Keep on keeping on.  Maybe watch some it gets better videos (I find them awesome and inspiring despite that they're not technically made for me).

I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 8, but my mother had this ""natural remedies/ homeopathy"" phase so she didn't want to put me on meds. I got through highschool fairly easily, without ever actually studying or doing homework.

I went to university for a year but had a lot of trouble keeping up with all the tons of homework assignments, so after two semesters and a summer of me again not studying, I conceded that I had a problem. This was actually when I figured out that I really do have ADHD, because I wasn't really sure I had it.

I called up a local psychiatrist who's a specialist in ADHD, made an appointment, talked for an hour and then got a prescription for ritalin already. I showed her the doctors notes of my diagnosis from when I was 8, but she seemed to not really care about that.

"7278","Generally speaking, stimulants don't ""burn out"" the dopamine receptors. It sounds like your problem might be twofold: 

1. You're abusing your meds. If they're not working at the ""right"" dosage then it isn't the right dosage, OR it isn't the right medication. People react differently to different stimulants--for example, I respond well to dex, but not to methylphenidate. You should work with your doctor to find something that works for you on a steady dosage. You might not be keeping track of how much medication you're taking and you may actually be experiencing these symptoms because you're taking too much. You don't want to go down that road of abusing meds turning into addiction. 

2. You don't need to ""feel"" the dopamine or norepinephrine. If you're confusing the initial euphoria of meds with them working, you should know that when they're working properly and you're at the right dosage, you *shouldn't* feel that euphoria. It should feel neutral; not good, not bad.  

--Remember that when the dosage wears off, most people experience a bit of withdrawal, usually for an hour or two. During this time, you can definitely feel like your ADHD is worse, as there can be some rebound. If you have some time of productivity and focus on meds, you might also feel that your ADHD is worse off meds, because you're now comparing your medicated vs. unmedicated states. 

--There are definitely answers and help for people with ADHD. You should probably start by talking to your doctor about these problems, rather than just trying to self-medicate. You can also work with a therapist or coach to work out those problems of ""over-complication"" and daily tasks (like housework).  ","dgye3ii",3,1493578535,"2017-04-30 18:55:35"
"7279","Perhaps a break in the mental ward is not bad. Sometimes when shit gets hard for me I think about how it would be more peaceful if I was in mental ward, even though it might frustrate me at first.

I don't know about the stigmas you would get in your region/culture though for being admitted to the mental ward(because sending someone to mental ward for having ADHD sounds like they have a poor understanding of mental health in general). For me, I would definitely like to be put in the hands of professionals(not the shitty ones) if my life would become unbearable to the point where I'd start ruining my life and become self-destructive.

I guess my advice for you is that no matter how shitty things might seem, it's actually not that bad once you go through it and sometimes it's good to take a break from daily tasks and read a book or sth. Usually that doesn't happen for me when I'm caught up with my shitty daily routine.

"7281","I have to say I have the same diagnosis and am in the mild-moderate range- but I have no qualms with being on meds or with overthinking my diagnosis. I think I was always depressed growing up. I remember telling my dad when I was 6 that I didn’t feel any emotions that whole day, and my dad just acted like I was being silly. I became depressed after my best friend died, and I had about 5 people in my life pass away in the course of 7 years. That triggered real “suicidal thoughts” depression. All that is to say I think I have an idea of where you’re coming from with this post. 

I think you should roll with your diagnosis. Did you ever have a conversation with a friend where you asked how they got their degree while working a high pressure job, or lost a lot of weight, or got in really great shape, or bought a house and paid it off in 5 years? They tell you “you just set a goal and do it. You just do it every day, and don’t lose focus of your goal.” That sounds inspiring, so you decide you’re taking your first steps tomorrow. Except the next night you go to bed realizing you either avoided it or forgot all about it. So you beat yourself up about it and decide tomorrow is the day. But every day after that is the same thing too. Does that feel familiar? With your meds I would suspect that it actually seems possible to finally do those things, and suddenly you can “just do the thing”. Hang on to that and see where it takes you. Keep going to therapy and keep having honest discussions with your therapist and hopefully you will realize this was the right diagnosis and maybe one day you can go off your meds, or maybe not.","f1shpmx",1,1569729028,"2019-09-29 03:50:28"

Try saying less and just use facial and tonal expressions.  People tend to ""write in"" to expressions what they think you mean.   

Anything that starts to sound like a paragraph coming out of your mouth is likely to lead into a circle as you remember what you intended to say four sentences in.    So, be less ad hoc.  Witty people say more with fewer words, and that's a habit that benefits us, too.  

To be persuasive, writing is so much better for us, thanks to computers.  On the typewriter, you couldn't mouse back and insert.  If you're going to give a long speech, write an outline before you attempt it.  Otherwise, you will skip and circle thanks to the ADHD.

Try coffee  (either no sugar or zero-calorie sweetener) as the caffeine will give you some of the same thing that the amphetamines will.   A few cups a day isn't a dangerous amount.  Pick a level that you're comfortable with and do not increase it and occasionally take a day off.

It’s like our brains don’t have filters to the satisfaction parts and we are on the look out for constant excitement/stimulation and some meds can help us focus on what we need by almost over stimulating to the point of focus. 

CBT can help us almost force a different path to success through repetition of the positive and help us slow down and evaluate the right choices thus helping us deal with problems more easily so a combination of both meds and CBT can work wonders.

""Q: Are there any limitations to telepsychiatry treatment?
A: All limitations inherent in the traditional psychiatrist-patient relationship are present in telepsychiatry. You may need to visit your primary care physician prior to any treatment with medications. Not all consultations will result in the prescription of medication. When indicated, prescriptions can be sent (electronically, via fax, or by phone) to the patient's pharmacy of choice. However, some states and federal laws provide stipulations when prescribing Schedule II, III, IV and V medications.""

Seems like most doctors would be afraid of backlash since it's probably controversial in some places. Doesn't make any sense to me, someone could convince a doctor the same via video chat as in real life, as well as take any tests necessary to indicate a condition. Unless the doctor has to hook me up to a brainwave scanning machine or something I don't see how online would be any different. It seems to hurt the insecure and socially anxious people the most because I know a lot of friends who aren't afraid one bit to go to a doctor and bogus their way into getting prescriptions.

After doing some further reading it sounds like it's federally illegal to prescribe controlled substances without at least one in-person visit due to the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act. But it seems to be potentially changing in the near future, ""In 2016, DEA announced plans to issue a new rule to activate the special registration process allowing physicians to use telemedicine to prescribe controlled substances without an in-person exam.""

"7346","I've been taking Strattera for a few months now, my doctor has slowly upped my dose and currently I'm at 70mg.

So at first I took it in the morning, but it made me really tired, like taking constant naps when I had the time. After a week or two I switched to taking it in the evenings (read this in a post on here) and since then it's been much better. Sure, I still get tired during the day and sometimes take naps, but that's depending on how much sleep I got the night before.

There's only one thing that really bothers me and two I need to be careful of. 

1. Since starting Strattera I noticed that it is much easier for me to sweat a lot. I currently live in a city where I have to walk 45 min to get to uni and after 15 min I am already hot and sweating buckets. It also kept me from getting enough sleep with my extra-thick blanket during winter, even though the heating was off in our bedroom.

2. I need to take my meds after eating, otherwise I lose my appetite.

3. Need to be careful not to get constipated, but certain foods and drinking enough usually takes care of that.

To be honest, I can't really feel the positive effects, because there is no ""rush"" and no ""crash"". Some people also thought the Strattera wasn't working, stopped taking them and only after it stopped working realized it actually did work. I do know that it is working for me at least: my speech processing and production have definitely improved, my fine motor function in my right hand got better (I used to drop things a lot, sometimes stuff just slipped right from my hand) and when I try to be productive I do actually get things done, it also seems to improve my working memory a bit.

Obviously, everbody is different. For some people the side effects are much worse, some don't get any at all. I definitely prefer it to Methylphenidate.

TL,DR: Started Strattera in November, some side-effects, but they are for the most part manageable. It is working for me, but everybody is different.","ejcikml",1,1553530566,"2019-03-25 16:16:06"

The advantage of a shower penis club is you get to use it to show off in the locker room and sometimes to flirt with the sex you are trying to get acquainted with.

The advantage of a grower penis club is the feeling you give your partner when they made this tiny thing into this large and hard thing.

Do not see this as a downside with Concerta or other similar meds, instead just see this as swapping one list of traits for another, like swapping from Costco to Sam's membership cards or vice versa.

Now you may personally prefer the advantages of the grower club or the shower club but do not forget the other club has its perks too.","dctf0sg",3,1485212145,"2017-01-23 22:55:45"

Personally the one thing I’d strike from his advice is the “if you wanted it bad enough you’d change things”. IMO that’s an ADHD thing he may not understand. If you didn’t want to change things, why go back to him at all? Why haven’t you already given up?

[3 minute summary from psych central](http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-link-between-adhd-and-obesity/0003144)

[One such study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24131879)

&gt;RESULTS:

&gt;...

&gt; **Higher oppositional behavior and social communication problems related to higher BMI-SDS scores, whereas more stereotyped behaviors related to lower BMI-SDS scores.** We found no effects of the other examined associated risk factors on BMI-SDS.**


&gt;CONCLUSIONS:

&gt;Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in boys is a risk factor for overweight. In girls with ADHD, the prevalence of overweight is age dependent and most pronounced in girls aged 10 to 12 years. **They have a 4-fold risk of being obese**. Higher oppositional and social communication problems pose an increased risk for overweight, whereas sleep duration, motor coordination problems, and methylphenidate use do not.



Now we can't say this for sure why higher oppostional behavior and social problems are a predictor of more overweight issues but here is a theory that is most likely true that I have seen scientists propose and I also agree with.

Oppositional Behavior and Social Problems are almost always tied to higher impulsivity scores compared to other ADHD people.  People that have compulsive mannerisms on the other hand are often more neurotic and more anxious and are subject to more internalizing disorders when compared to their ADHD peers with higher impulsivity scores.

The impulsivity is what causes the over eating, binge eating, not exercising (you procrastinate), etc.

----

There is one eating disorder we do not see higher in the ADHD population and that is Anoxeria.  ADHD people often have a poor self image and body issues (body dysmorphic disorder) and usually body dysmorphic disorder increases your chance of Anorexia.  This is not the case with ADHD for it takes a lot of self control to stop eating.  Thus they may feel like an anorexic person but they do not control it like an anorexic person can.

Instead these people usually turn to Bulimia which in some ways is just as bad for it damages lots of body organs such as your throat (come on cancer, kidney damage, or heart attack)","cqqfibw",2,1430155737,"2015-04-27 17:28:57"

"7406","Fourth grade teacher dumped out my desk in the middle of the classroom (during class) because it wasn't tidy enough for her.  She berated me and encouraged my classmates to join in while I stood there sobbing and hyperventilating.  My classmates were so stunned, most of them just stood there blinking.  One of them eventually came over and helped me clean up.  There are very few people in my life I actually hate, but that asshole is one of them.  Something inside me broke that day, and 25 years later, it's still not quite fixed.

Edit:  I forgot the other bad story.  My first grade teacher was a real hardass, and as someone who also has anxiety, this was not a good thing.  I would start feeling sick during class because she stressed me out so badly (she was just rude, loud, mean, and liked to pick on me).  Then I developed this thing where I had to pee every 10 minutes because I was so amped up.  She sent multiple notes home to my parents telling them what a spaz I was, and that I should be in special ed or homeschooled because I'm just too slow and I wasn't able to handle ""real life"".  She called me a ""wuss"" on multiple occasions, too.  I can remember once I developed a splitting headache and a stomach ache (I'm 6, FFS), so I went to the office and they called my dad to come get me.  This teacher saw me waiting in the office, said ""Oh, HELL no"", and physically dragged me back to the classroom.  I wasn't the only kid she targeted, and she was eventually ""moved to an administrative position downtown"".  She died a few years ago, and I went out and had drinks to celebrate.

Your theory works, there's actually been studies somewhere saying that ADHDers work best in stress-related jobs and situations, so it makes sense. It's also possible that your anxiety is related to being told previously in family/friend/classroom situations that you do talk too much/don't listen/etc, causing you to associate stress to new relationships and not want to be seen as rude, therefore you pay more attention, type thing. 

For me, personally, focusing with stress and anxiety really depends on the situation. If it's a week until my assignment is due, that stress and anxiety makes it happen. If it's a month out, I'm stressed and anxious and hating myself for my inability to do it, but it doesn't happen until it's closer, leaving me with a big period of hating myself. XD With people, I find I'm better in a 'work stress' type mode. Like co-worker says ""this needs to happen like this, because reasons"", I go okay, and do the thing like that because reasons. XD But if I'm not in that focused environment, it's kind of a 50/50 if I'll actually be focused or just like ""Wait. . . what'd they say?"" XD 

I think a big factor is whether I feel overwhelmed or not. At work, I know my job, I'm capable, the only time I start freaking out is when things have changed and I have to try and adjust to that as I go. 

As for the at home/people you're comfortable with, you're . . . (shock, horror) comfortable with being yourself. Seems to me that there's no urgency to focus and engage your brain in the same way you do in anxious/stress situations because there is no anxiety or stress to power that adrenaline. At home should be the place you use the least energy, especially stress-based energy, so that totally makes sense to me. 

Now it's just a matter of whether my response makes sense to anyone else :P 

Also, how do you do with caffeine/energy drinks?

A lot of people seem either unaware of or like to disregard the use of caffeine in treating ADHD, maybe because it hasn't been studied extensively yet.

"7466","I'm getting married on Saturday.  

We've been together 10 years and have been planning this wedding over the last two.  Two years ago we bought a house because we both wanted that before getting married so a lot of the planning was put on hold until this year.  Last summer we found our venue and that started the ball rolling and soon found our other vendors.  Since then we've spent our time planning everything else and taking our time with things.  Things really kicked into gear about 6 months ago when we actually started working on getting things done.

But that's not the biggest thing for me.  About 6 months ago I was in a deep hole at work.  I couldn't concentrate on anything, getting really distracted and falling behind.  I was diagnosed when I was in elementary school, titrated meds in middle school and after bad experiences with my meds in high school I stopped taking them completely.  Then one day I get called into my boss's office and he gives me an ultimatum: either I drastically improve my performance at work in the next two weeks or I'm fired.  When he asked why he thought I wasn't doing well I told him the first thing that came to mind: my ADD.  That was the first time since high school I admitted to someone else (outside my fiancee) that I had ADD.  After that day I found a psychiatrist and started taking meds again.  I'm now on 60mg Vyvanse and have completely turned things around.  I'm able to do my work, get things done and really contribute to planning a wedding.  I took charge in planning out everything that was left to do and went so far to make a Kanban board of things to do.  Now with a few days to go there are only a few small tasks left and then we finally get to have some free time.  

For us, the wedding itself isn't a major accomplishment in our relationship, but putting it together and pulling the event off sure is.  To me though, just getting here is the biggest thing.  ","cswb7a9",2,1436372040,"2015-07-08 16:14:00"

I do take Ritalin and it does help some but it would honestly help anyone, ADHD or not, which is why it is so abused in colleges for helping increase test scores.

I don't feel the need to hide it from people, really. If they accept it, great. If they're uninformed or don't understand it, I'm happy to explain it to them. If they stigmatize and reject me for it, I'm better off without them, anyway. (For the record, I haven't actually encountered that kind of response from anyone.

"7480","I have a friend that frequently tells me that taking meds and going to a therapist makes the problem worse.  This is largely because he thinks that I didn't start complaining about sleeping too much until after I started on the meds (it is actually that I felt I was sleeping 12+ hours a day a couple of times a week in the months leading up to me deciding enough was enough and I started to seek treatment).

He is also a big fan of telling me that I am being disingenuous when I tell him that I am not likely to be worth a darn at work after a long night of drinking.  He tells me that he is able to get up after a long night of drinking and crank through work.  He says that the difference between us is that I have weak willpower.  I am fine with somebody telling me that I have weak willpower.  It might as well be the word for what my problem is.  It is just hyper frustrating when they then use that diagnosis to bash whatever method I want to use to deal with the problem.  I do the keto thing, and it would be like somebody saying ""the reason you are heavier than you want to be is because you are eat too much"".  Then I say, well, I am cutting down on carbs because they mess with my hormones and make me hungry and eat too much.  Then they reply ""I eat carbs and it doesn't make me so hungry that I can't resist eating too much, so you must have weak willpower"".  I respond ""well maybe carbs messes with my hormones more than you, so cutting them out will make it easier for me to not over eat"".  They respond ""bullshit, you should eat carbs and just not eat too much"".  Why can't I just deal with my problems?!  People keep saying that the only way I should deal with any issue is by ""manning up"".

The ironic thing is that he wears glasses.  I do not understand how people can run around and say that there is no such thing as people using techniques other than simply ""manning up"" to overcome their shortcomings when they have a ""crutch"" sitting right on their nose!

Just as some people have a more difficult time seeing objects far away (so move closer to what they want to look at or wear glasses) I have trouble getting things done (so I try to avoid being sleep deprived or hungover or use therapies like drugs or counseling).

It is not an uncommon but it is so troubling when people assume that there is no possible way that other people can be different from them and so they discount the idea that other people might need to use different methods of getting things done other than manning up.

"7485","TLDR: revising by helping someone else revise is somewhat effective for me, and I suggest you try it incase it works for you too

I can't only study by helping other people study. Quite a few ADHD people I've seen said they just gain a weird and sudden ability to help other people with things like work and studying, but can't do it themselves. I ask my friends questions and then tell them the answers if they were wrong, usually for the 3 science subjects which I seem to not forget anything from (but I forget everything from every other subject other than computer studies maybe). I find it really effective for feeling productive and helpful, as well as feeling like I have done at least some revision. All other methods of revising are impossible to me, this is the only one I can do, even though I can find it tough to stay on task. The other person helps greatly with that though, I tell them to put me back on subject when I go off on a small ramble about something completely irrelevant. Having other people to help revise is a powerful tool, I highly suggest you try it with a friend. In fact I did this today, just a couple hours ago. He asked if I was taking notes and I just said no, I can't. He understands that I understand what I mean by what I say so he normally just goes with it. He asks me questions about what he just read to make sure I know the stuff. And the  I start questioning him about what I know and he just read or may not quite remember from lessons. That was a very long comment but I hope you find at least some of it useful. Don't get to worked up about not being able to study, though I know how much stress it can cause, I've been there too.

BUT, it is known that the development of the brain is heavily affected by childhood experiences. For example, it is completely uncontroversial that spanking children causes increased incidences of violent and antisocial misbehavior throughout childhood and later in life. Of course there are genetic factors, and many many people from functional and happy families have ADHD. However, OP's explanation very well could play a large part in frontal lobe/prefrontal cortex underdevelopment in children from that environment (such as myself). To say that there are no purely environmental factors or causes of mental disorders which we don't yet fully understand would be irresponsible.

"7489","&gt; D: Why? That... what?

Lol, yeah, it's hyperfocusing on stuff like this that got me so into math in the first place.

I could go on and on about the reasons why addition and subtraction are kind of the same thing, but to get your brain to believe it, just notice that the procedure you use for addition and subtraction are very similar in form: in both cases, you process one digit at a time, you get an ""answer"" digit that depends only on the two corresponding digits of the numbers you wanted to add/subtract, and you might carry something over to the next digit (a +1 in the case of addition or a -1 in the case of subtraction).

More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_complements

I guess another way to understand it, now that I've read that article, is that replacing the digits of the second number (let's call it y, and let's call the first number x) in the way I described is equivalent to calculating 99999-y. And removing the leading digit at the end is equivalent to subtracting 100000 from the sum. So what we really did was calculate x+(99999-y)+1-100000 = x-y.","d3n5ue8",1,1464458713,"2016-05-28 18:05:13"

"7492","this is solid advice! I'd like to add that having a healthy focus on your goals, and a healthy way of managing time is really the best anyone can do!  I think its a common misconception that others who have managed their time well or reached certain goals, that they must have been on top of those goals all along.  I think that putting that pressure on ourselves (ADHD or not) is unfair and unhealthy.  I am learnning to manage what I can do and ask myself if I am doing my best for right now and just being mindful of the future.  Perfection is not the goal, and while planning is wise, it is a fact of life that everyone must deal with, that as much as you can plan and prepare, you can never assure the outcome.  But, I think the key is that there is still hope! and still value in  setting goals and working towards them, finding value in the journey, being present along the way, and finding that precious balance between striving to be better and enjoying where you are now. ✌","e9f576c",4,1541860540,"2018-11-10 14:35:40"
"7493","It's great. I've learned *a lot* from here. I understand your reservations on the journal. It's one of the types of things that are hardest for us (I am ADHD-PI too). Either because we can't stick to it or because it can lead down a rabbit hole where we overanalyze and spend way to much time thinking about what information to include, when to write etc. Those small decisions can be so taxing.

Since usually there isn't a single area in our lives that doesn't urgently need improvement and structure it can also be so hard just to choose one or a few areas to work on and to justify spending time everyday on something like a journal. I find myself reluctant to similiar ideas since I've already tried forming habits and improving countless times in the past just to fail a few days to a month later.

It's probably wise to put off using a journal until you actually need one. If you take your time and don't rush like I did that may be sufficient. I need the journal because I've gotten to a point where I don't know if the dosage is right, too low or too high (I know it's not far off but a small difference might have a large effect on productivity and quality of life).

There's also some other variables I need to consider like exactly when to take the second dose (how many hours to wait), how large the afternoon dose should be compared to the morning dose, and ratio of dexedrine to vyvanse (I need the dexedrine to get up in the morning and not be late). I think it would be almost impossible for me to get all of these right without being systematic and using some kind of journal.

"7516","I have to weigh in on this one because this exact issue is something that has effected me my entire life and is something that is forcing me make some extremely difficult decisions currently. 

&gt;ADHD is not a free pass to hurl insults at your partner, lash out at them, or be mean. 

I have to agree with u/Lisbethhh on this one because my Father was the type of person who did this. He would explode into anger and hate fueled rampages and would say the most fucked up shit to you that would cut into the deepest parts of your core. You never really could know what would trigger these rampages but when they happened they were intense and horrifying.

Even after my Mother and Brother permanently left him and I began splitting my time 50/50 between my Mother and Father he would still treat me this way. Even after I began to grow visibly resentful of him and began to shut down around him he still treated me this way. Even after as I began to come into adult hood and told him that he was hurting me and that he had been hurting me my whole life he simply denied it, asked for specific examples, and then continued to treat me that way. Even after I almost completely cut him out of my life he would still blow up at random during our limited face to face interactions and phone calls.  And so just a few days ago after his most recent outburst I had to make the hardest decision of my life and write him an email telling him I had disowned him as my Father and that I had blocked his number and that I didn't want to speak to him for the foreseeable future.

He may very well have ADHD or some other mental disorder and it  is true that he wasn't constantly hurtful. The majority of my life is filled with good memories with him and I do (or did, I'm not fully sure anymore) love him. That is why his actions were even more hurtful and unforgivable. Being hurt by a loved one is the worst kind of pain a person can experience. It leaves you twisted up on the inside. It makes you question yourself and whether or not you are a good person. I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and trust issues (even among my closest and dearest friends) throughout the majority of my life and I know it is in large part because of how my father treated me. 

There is never an excuse for this kind of behavior. Not towards strangers, not towards co-workers, not towards friends, and especially not towards family and loved ones. 

While I do believe that there needs to be more forgiveness and compassion in the world there also comes a point where enough is enough. If you can be strong enough to forgive the people close to you when they hurt you then those people need to be strong enough to apologize, but more importantly they need to be strong enough to grow and change. 

It is entirely possible to learn to work with your emotions and not be ruled by them. It is entirely possible to learn to pop out of a certain head space or thought and not let it control you. This is a fact that I know to be true from practicing meditation, the mind is a muscle just like any other that simply needs specific and dedicated training. If you tell your loved one that they are hurting you then they need to be willing to take the time to learn how and why they are hurting you; learn how to prevent it from happening in the future; and they need to take it seriously. If they do not then that person is not worth having in your life... period.

I'm sorry you had to go through something similar and I hope it wasn't as bad as what I experienced because what I was forced to endure for 20 years was awful and I wish and hope that no one else has to go through the same. But unfortunately the reality of the situation is that there are many people in the world who are in similar situations as the one I was in and telling them to be quote ""**a little deaf and blind during fights""** is extremely dangerous and harmful.

This last message goes out to all of you who are currently in a situation similar to mine. Do not be afraid to stand up for yourself. These people can be scary, especially if they are a parent, and the repercussions could be harsh. I personally didn't even have the courage to stand up for myself face to face or over the phone, I had to do it in writing, and I can only wait to see what the damage will be to my family and to my life, but doing nothing is unacceptable. Allowing someone to be mean to you is unacceptable. For the first time in my life I finally feel free and feel like I can move forward, and nothing in this world is worth more than that.","fmbslvg",1,1585932457,"2020-04-03 16:47:37"
"7517","This is a big mood. The way I would handle it: get it out in a way that doesn't harm people.

Sometimes i'll vent to friends if they give permission for me to do so - people who I would trust to not necessarily let what i'm saying affect their personal opinion, and would trust not to let this information get out further. Sometimes i'll basically use social media as a big void to just scream into - posting on an account with no followers doesn't really work, because then it still feels Cooped Up inside, basically like writing in a diary, and that doesn't help. I need to at least have the CHANCE that someone, even a stranger who may never respond in any way, is reading it. Once I get that Furious Energy out, it's much easier to turn my attention to other things.

Otherwise, maybe just like, confront the person in a civil manner if it's a big and continuous enough issue that that's the only way to solve it, and you think it might get you somewhere.

**What NOT to do:**

Don't vaguepost. If the person you're angry at is following you on one form of social media, post it on a different one that they're not on, or use website features to keep them from seeing the post. Vagueposting is absolutely crazy-making to the people who are reading it, and it's cowardly when you could just talk to them about the issue. Or, recognize the behaviors that they are doing that are making you so angry, and post about that so that they are not necessarily wondering if they are the ones at fault. (i.e. instead of 'this fucking asshole in my life did x thing' talk about an overarching behavior like 'when people do X thing it really fucking gets to me and maybe here's some self-evaluation as to why it bothers me so much, here's what it feels like'.) You don't want to actually cause someone mental anguish through what you write, but you still deserve to be able to talk about it.

Don't speak with the intent of turning others against the person, unless they've SERIOUSLY done something FUCKED UP and other people deserve to be warned. The way I handle this is, like I said, speaking to people I trust to stay neutral, and sometimes disclaimering that it isn't actually a big issue and I just need to vent. Be clear with your intent and don't act out of malice.

Notably, this is coming from the point of view of, like, talking about people I personally know and have to interact with/choose to interact with on the regular. If you're furious at an internet rando for being shitty, yeah, just vent that shit out. Your anger doesn't necessarily affect their life, they may never even see you say anything, if you vaguepost about it at least be sure to add that it's not about anybody you actually know personally. (And, of course, always be sure to ask permission when ranting to a friend directly.)","epzl2bo",1,1559667744,"2019-06-04 17:02:24"

I’ve been successful in jobs that are short bursts. Things that require lengthy projects were my undoing, but being a 911 dispatcher was my favorite and best job because my taskers never lasted more than 30 minutes.

Think about it as it taking a lot of energy to stay completely focused, and ""being good"" and then being drained.

"7536","Brace for an honest answer here:

I'm going into 3L. In high school and undergrad, I always excelled despite my ADHD. Growing up everyone used to joke about me becoming a lawyer bc of my tendency to debate and passionately participate in discussion (i.e. come off like a dick = what the public thinks of lawyers). When I applied to law school (after deciding that ""my dream"" of getting a PhD and becoming a physicist wasn't actually what I wanted), my parents expressed concern because of my procrastination, lack of detail-orientation, general disorganization, etc. I completely ignored the concerns and went for it anyway. 

My 1L experience was awesome! I loved my classes, my readings (the ones I was able to do) were extremely interesting, and I felt it was a good environment for breaking procrastination and bad study habits. Everyone who is there is very good at school, just being in that kind of environment makes you better at school by osmosis. But once midterm exams came around, I found I had missed more readings than I had realised, procrastinated on beginning to study, but still basically finished around the middle of the pack by cramming.

Some classes: Contracts and Property, I found incredibly boring, I missed more and more classes and readings. And ended up with a D+ in contracts. It was my worst mark ever and it was a huge blow. 

Other classes: criminal and torts, I found incredibly interesting. They had a more obvious moral dimension and so the discussion and debate was more participatory and loose. Generally, I excelled in the classes that were more participatory. 

In second year, I basically fell behind on my medication and fell wayyyy behind in every lecture-based procedure course. Evidence and Civ Pro and Professional Responsibility (courses about the rules about lawyering) I tanked. F, D+, F respectively. I procrastinated studying to the last minute, never did my readings for those classes, couldn't pay attention in class... It was the most depression and self-loathing I have experienced in my life. 

I still did very well in more creative, morality-focussed, participation classes. I took two major paper courses (basically a small class which is very focussed on a certain area where you discuss issues in that area and write a journal-quality paper). and got an A and A+. My A+ paper won an award for legal philosophy last year. 

The first thing I do when I get to school this week is talk to my counsellor for regular and specific meetings focussed on procrastination. Its basically at a totally unsustainable and possibly life-ruining level for me right now, even with medication. I passed both my make-up exams for the classes I failed over the summer. But trying to find articling positions now is going to be EXTREMELY hard for me because of my grades. I have done legal work every summer since 1L, but I will have to very work hard to find articles. 

There are successful lawyers with ADHD (I worked with one this summer). The guy I know personally: it has created large problems for him during his firm life, and his reputation at the Bar has suffered as a result.  But there are other who, with counselling and support and medication, find their niche. We are creative and good at original thinking, especially when we're interested. Those are GREAT attributes for lawyers. We are also bad for remembering details and paying attention when something isn't engaging. Those are TERRIBLE attributes for practicing law day-to-day. 

If you can develop and monitor a strategy to blunt our negatives, and take advantage of our positives... I think ADHD will never stand in your way of being a successful law student/lawyer. 

But cautionary tale for you: don't fall behind on meds and supports during the heaviest academic year of your life, the consequences for me were dire. 

TL;DR

Law School Positives:
- Competitive environment that socializes you to blunt your bad habits. 
- super engaging material
- participatory classrooms
- creative thinking skills are rewarded

Law School negatives:
- workload requires hella organization
- 3-hour classes about the rules of civil procedure or contracts or whatever bores you. 
- lots and lots and lots of detailed and nuenced reading. 
- fast pace of study: you fall behind QUICK.","eyk33tw",1,1567135437,"2019-08-30 03:23:57"
"7537","Vyvanse is a stimulant, so take it early in the day.  When I first started I had a lot of trouble sleeping also.  In time (like a few months), your body will get a little more used to it.  If I take it regularly around 6am, it starts to wear off around 8pm, and I'm ready to sleep around 10.

One thing to watch for is appetite.  Vyvanse will suppress your appetite, and you may just not feel hungry during the day.  It took a long time for me to start to recognize that being sleepy and lethargic was the new sign that I was hungry.  Taking a nap would just make it harder to sleep that night.  

I've found that a powerful tool for dealing with ADHD is developing routines, and keeping a schedule.  Of course, 20 some-odd years of undiagnosed ADHD made learning to do that very difficult.  The meds help, but it still takes a lot of work.

I'd always gotten good grades by virtue of being smart but never pushed myself or done as well as I could have, so I never really thought about ADD until I couldn't accomplish any of my goals without the stipulation of grades and classes. That led me to get pretty depressed about myself and I made some bad decisions during that time until I started seeing a campus psychologist and he suggested getting tested for ADD, since most of my depression came from my dissatisfaction with myself for not being able to do things.

"7560","While /r/relationship_advice get's an awful amount of abuse because there first suggestion is always ""DUMP THEM"", the most important thing they talk about is setting &amp; maintaining personal boundaries.

You sound like a great partner, and it sounds like your boyfriend is going through some stuff right now. None of that excuses shitty behaviour from him. It sounds like you've chosen not to break up with him (yet), but I would urge you to tread cautiously from here on out. It's important that you have a clear idea in your head about what you can do to help, what your boyfriend can control, and what are the reasonable limits for continuing with your relationship.

I want to spell out some things from your post:

* Your boyfriend doesn't maintain open lines of communication with you when he is angry or upset.
* Your boyfriend has recently started having angry, emotional outbursts for the first time. One recent outburst was so extreme that you consider it **""one of the scariest moments of [your] life"".**
* These outbursts are unrelated to your relationship but your boyfriends passive-aggressiveness and attitude during them become so toxic that they **""continually leave [you] in tears"".**
* He has begun affirming you less, showing you less attention overall.
* You've spoken to him recently about how his behaviour effects you, and he responded negatively by questioning why you were making his issues **""about [you]""**. *(I'm not sure if this has happened, but seeing as you used quotation marks when you said ""about me"" it seems likely.)*

If you had said you were three months away from moving across the US to live **WITH** him, I would be screaming at you not to do it. Going to live ""near"" him doesn't make me as concerned, but only slightly.

Bottom line, whatever your boyfriend is going through right now isn't an excuse to make you feel bad, upset, or scare you. 

You need to have a conversation with your boyfriend, and set your boundaries going forward. Especially considering you're going to be moving from a LDR to a more normal relationship soon.","gt4uh91",1,1617366291,"2021-04-02 12:24:51"

"7602","I use to not be able to do more than 35 minutes of studying before having to take a break (10 minutes or so). Problem was that I also needed another 10-15 minutes to really get back into what I was doing before so I wouldn't get much more than 30-35 minutes of actual work done every hour or so. The ""actual work"" wasn't always productive though as I would often zone out of it for a few minutes or stop focusing on the problem and think about what I was going to do next. At bad times I would do about 15 minutes of good, useful work per hour spent sitting at a table with my books opened. 

Then I started trying different locations to study. I knew I had a really hard time doing homework at home because there was a lot of distractions (computer, games, wanting to clean even though I had done so the day before) so I tried to spend most of my time outside my home as possible to a point where this semester, I've built my class schedule in such way that I start at 8 am pretty much every day and my last class ends at 6 pm. This made me realize that I'm highly motivated to study/do homework for a class right after I come out of it. Being at school for 10 hours a day I have a lot of free time between classes so I made a schedule of what I want to do between each classes. For instance on Mondays I have 2 hours of class at 8, then 2 hours off, 2 hours of class at 12, then 2 hours off and 2 hours of class at 4, get home by 6:30 for a total of 6 hours of free time at school for that day. I know that I won't do much when I get home (get home at 6:30, eat, shower, relax a bit and it's almost time to get my stuff ready for the next day and go to bed) so I get as much done during the free time.

What I typically do is if I have 2 hours between 2 classes, I'll spend about 50 minutes working on the first class I just attended. This material is fresh as I just attended a lecture, my brain is (usually) in the right 'setting' for that subject and things just seem to work easily. Then I take a quick break (5-10 minutes) and study for the class that comes next for another 50 minutes or so (followed by a 10 minutes break before class). This gives me an opportunity to switch my brain to the right setting (hope that makes sense) so when I walk in for the lecture I'm already thinking about that class. It also gives me some time to read the things we'll be covering in class beforehand, making following the lecture a lot easier as I tend to day dream a lot and miss parts and bits of what's being said. If I zone out for a minute or so but I have an idea of what the teacher is talking about because I read the chapter right before class, getting back into writing notes is a lot easier and I don't find myself lost as much.

Last summer I took an intensive class (to try and catch up after doing badly the semester before) and the classes were at night (6-10pm, 5 times a week for a month which covered 4 months of material). During that time I found out that I work pretty well late at night assuming I'm not too tired. I would go to a 24-hour coffee shop right after class and get as much work done as I could while my brain still felt like that subject was interesting. It clearly wasn't as effective as what I'm doing now (I also have medication to help this semester) but for the few weeks I had to take night classes I found that this method worked.

This is getting really long so I'll stop right here. I think everybody's different for preference about how to study. What's important is that you find what you're comfortable with, which can only come with trying. I really suggest you make a schedule (if you haven't already) of all the time you have to do some work (no matter how short) and try different times and see what feels right. I once read somewhere (or was told by a professor, can't remember) that the average person couldn't pay attention for longer than 50 minutes without taking a break. Honestly this feels like a very long time and for people diagnosed with ADHD that seems like an eternity. For me it's about finding the balance of studying for long enough that it's worth it without getting to the point where I'm just staring at the problem for 15 minutes not actually doing anything. This is hard to master for people in our situation but it's a skill that'll last you for your entire life.

Oh and one quick note on medication: Canadian government (or at least my provincial government, not sure where it comes from) will only reimburse you for long-lasting medication (ie. pills you take once a day) if you first try and use the short-lasting (4 times a day, every 4 hours) pills first. I still have a week or so to go on the 4-times a day pills before my doctor changes my prescription to long-lasting but what I have noticed might help you if you end up staying with the medication you're using now. I can actually feel the effect of the medication about 25-30 minutes after taking it and it'll usually feel like it's working really weel for about 2 and a half hours, at which point I start noticing the effect wearing off slowly. I try to make the 'high point' of the medication fit with my work schedule as much as possible so I get the maximum out of it. Try and notice when the effect starts to kick in and wear off, build your schedule around this to maximize the effectiveness of your studying. I'm no doctor though so that might be something you want to discuss with your MD.

Good luck!

tl;dr: Found out I worked best right before and right after a class. Made my class schedule to allow me to do just that and try to get all my work done in the periods I feel I can concentrate the best. Try and schedule around the effect of the medication (kicking in to wearing off) as well.","c42t95z",3,1332209059,"2012-03-20 02:04:19"

Given the alternative,being a lump on a log, I would gladly deal with these side effects. 

I have run most of the gambit of add meds, from Ritalin( generic name Methylphenidate), Adderall (Amphetamine Salts), and Concerta (sort of like Ritalin Methylphenidate), and finally landed on Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine). Ritalin made me kind of robotic. I took it during elementary though middle school. In highschool I was on and off of it. I'm sure my teachers could tell. In to college I was on Adderall. I could take it and turn in to a freaking study/cleaning monster. I would pull all nighters a lot and lost a crazy amount of weight.  I tried Concerta for a month and it really did nothing for me. I know Ritalin and it are similar but I don't know,  just didn't work. Then my doctor settled on Vyvanse. It was the last because it was the most expensive for me before I had decent insurance. But I like it. I don't get ""cracked out"" like on aderall.  I'm not robotic like on Ritalin. I'm just focused and active. 

Unless you are trying to conserve your meds, save money, or told by a doctor I don't suggest interrupting your dose.

This is all my personal experience. I am in no way a medical professional or fully understand the chemistry behind it. I just know what works for me. 

tl;dr: I have tried most add meds and vyvanse had works best for me. Also in my opinion don't interrupt dosages . ","ccyppqd",3,1382632381,"2013-10-24 16:33:01"

The only hobbies that stick are ones that give me quick satisfaction/success.  Drawing, painting, and hand lettering takes too much practice, and I get bored of it so quickly.  I have found some projects that will stick with me, and I do get that feeling of satisfaction of completing something well, but will also easy get frustrated and give up as soon as the project is not going the way I want it to.

I think Drs /psychiatrists  have to be careful, it is a highly controlled medication so just the fact that you have had several sessions is insurance to avoid accusations of being a pill pusher and more  investigation of you and your condition to ensure your not drug seeking.

 Start the smallest possible part of the easiest task. Tell yourself you only have to do it for ten minutes, then you can take a short break - you might want to continue working or not, see what happens. Walk around the block for five minutes. Then reassess - how are you feeling? 

Once you get moving on the tasks, think about putting together a to do list with the things and their priority, broken into small steps. Don't do it if it feels overwhelming though. Keep taking breaks, but make them active or rewarding breaks that won't suck you in too much. Make tea, eat an apple, put something away. 

At some point, make a decision about how long you need to work or how much you need to get done (and be realistic - maybe you're going to have to do a mediocre job on some school work, that's okay), and think about how long it will take. Then promise yourself you only have to do that much then you can be done and not think about it any more.

I've found that meds aren't the only way to help you out, it's also resetting your mindset to one that's conducive to positive/effective studying (and by extension other aspects of your life).

What I've been doing instead, and have found to be much more helpful, is to create a simple list somewhere visible. Right now I've actually got a big dry erase whiteboard on my wall but you can use anything from a note app on your phone to a piece of paper. Whatever you choose, write out a list in no particular order of everything you'd want to do with your free time, it can be hobbies, reading a book, doing extra homework, it's entirely up to you, if it's something you would want to do at some point write it down. Then whenever you find yourself with free time just pick one or two things you'd like to do that feel achievable and write them somewhere else. Now whenever you feel busy or unfocused just glance at your short list and crack down on whatever you pick, and try and get as many done that day as you can. I've found this method to be low effort enough to be consistent with, which then leads to me getting more done and that motivation inspiring me to keep it up again the next day.

"7690","I was going to watch ""just one episode of mr. Robot"" until my friend was back from something, and ended up watching 4 in a row.

Tv shows can really get my attention, if theyre good.  Ill binge watch a good show and get sucked into it for hours.  Ive thought about this before actually,  and to be honest,  i think its because its a kind of mental escape.   8 hours straight of watching orange is the new black,  is 8 hours less of thinking about how shitty i feel about myself and the choices i make.

I always hate that feeling you get when you finally find something that keeps your focus and interest, like a good movie or show, and then it ends.  That ""back to shit reality"" feeling.    

I think i just realized that the only thing i can really focus on, is something that makes me feel like i wasnt actually here.  Things that take my mind away from where it currently is.  Not sure if that makes any sense. ","cudn9xu",1,1440396722,"2015-08-24 06:12:02"

"7694","It's hard to say. I was prescribed just about every drug for ADHD, even some that were light sedatives (both of the downers made my heart race like crazy and made me super irritable). Vyvanse was more or less a last ditch effort, and luckily it worked the best for me.

My sleep habits improved (still bad, but better than they were), don't get nearly as irritable, still feel creative although not as much so as before medication, but moreso it helps me focus enough to get stuff done and I wake up feeling rested even if I've had a rough night of sleep (prior to medication I rarely slept and was constantly fatigued and out of it).

It would be worth trying for a couple of months, but I believe it is recommended to take regularly and not just here and there PRN. I take mine daily and it took a couple of months to truly take effect, but if I stop taking it for a day or two then I have some mood swings during the non-use days and for a couple of days following getting back on schedule.

Again, I tried about every available prescription drug and Vyvanse 40mg is what ended up working for me. My prescriber did try to up it to 60mg but that just made me feel crazy jittery so I requested going back down to 40mg and have been at this dose for over a year.

Hopefully that helps a little. Good luck.

"7698","Hi! I was diagnosed later in life with ADHD because I have a somewhat photographic memory so instead of “remembering” facts, i see images with those facts in my head. People always praise me for being able to remember things and I always laugh because deep down I think I have a shit memory and I’m “cheating” by remembering with images. I didn’t understand until a few months ago that it’s a tool that I was able to adapt to my needs. Anyways, since I’m a visual person, I like my info in images so I found that screenshotting things reallyyyyy help me. 

I use to be embarrassed that I would screen shot things on Snapchat because the people were always notified but then I realized, no, your friend sent you a memory or a cute pic that you want and need to remember. So just do it ya know? Or hey that person you haven’t talked to in years just posted really good info about dogs. Well, I’m gonna screenshot for my own info!

Sometimes I don’t even look at the images again after I screenshot but it’s almost like actual physical action of pressing those two buttons on my phone is the same action in my brain and I put it into a mental folder for that person. 

Also, when I started dating my boyfriend I created a note on my phone with his “likes”. It was simple like: green, spider-man, tamales. And once those little 3 things were permanently stuck in my brain, I could add more info into my brain without feeling overwhelmed. 

I use to get mad at people for not remembering things about me either. But how can I get mad at people when I have my own similar difficulties? 

I like to think of my ADHD as a quirk (My Hero Academia anyone?) and my memory with faces and names can also be included with that. Maybe your partner has a better quirk or ability to remember little tidbits? Ask them for tips? Try not to put yourself down.  I’m sure you have some qualities your partner is jealous about too. 

Also also, I sent a lot of my friends info about ADHD mostly about the emotions and memory parts because I didn’t understand it about myself either. They were all super understanding. 

Also, I have heard my father somewhat berate my mother for her poor memory saying she has Alzheimer’s or Dementia (which she very well could) however, I believe she has undiagnosed ADHD and it 100% affects her memory! She retired a few years ago so she doesn’t have to use her brain to its full capacity so yeah, slip ups happen. But her self esteem about her memory is non-existent so she fully believes she is incapable of remembering anything. 

We all have to stop thinking of these things as major personality flaws that have anything to do with our character or soul.","fy3q3j4",1,1594779353,"2020-07-15 02:15:53"

If you want to learn more about ADHD, I highly recommend this youtube channel I'm linking here, in case you haven't come across her channel before.  (She's ADHD herself, in case it wasn't already obvious, and I mean that in the best way possible!)  The only thing I don't like about her channel is that she is very pro-medication, and kind of is pushy on other ADHDers to also take medication as the best option.  (Which definitely isn't for everyone.  Plus, there's natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals one can receive and learn about from a naturopath doctor).    [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nPM1\_kSZf91ZGkcgy\_95Q/featured](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nPM1_kSZf91ZGkcgy_95Q/featured)

I'd recommend seeing her ted talk first.  It's very informative, inspiring, and very relatable for ADHDers.  She explains the truth about ADHD, and busts all the myths surrounding it.  I definitely see myself in her, and I know many other ADHDers do too.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwZQNYlGQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwZQNYlGQI)

That's why I came here to post this. It's either I don't take it at all for the day or I have to dose when I start getting crashy or else another hour later I'm in bed asleep then I can't sleep all night. 

And it doesn't even make me high and never did, It just slows my brain down and let's me do a chore of two for the day. While this does not exempt me from the abuse arguement it does give me ground to stand on.

Sure it's not by the book use but it's no different with those with the larger prescriptions,  if I had 10mg 5x a day or 20 mg 3x a day I would be obeying the script to a T. 

I have lots of experience with abuse, my dad died of it and my mom went to prison for drug trafficking. I know where it can lead and how dangerous it is if not handled correctly. 

Please don't be so quick to suggest it because I didn't follow the sticker.

"7714","Yes you should ask your doctor.  Not specifically for a med in particular but for a different med and then you can list options such as Adderall, Vyvanse, Wellbutrin, Strattera, etc.  The doctor needs to try something different if the first thing does not work.

&gt; but I've read that if methylphenidate couldn't work, then methamphetamines won't either.

First this is plain old wrong. (It is just wrong, wrong, wrong *sigh*) If Ritalin or Concerta does not work that does not mean other ADHD meds such as Adderall/Vyvanse won't work or non stimulant ADHD meds like Stratteara or Intuniv.  Furthermore one med by itself may work kinda well but when you combine it with a second med it works a lot better due to synergy for the **ADHD meds do not work the same way.**  They all mess with neurotransmitters but they mess with neurotransmitters in different parts in the brain and in different ways.

Second it is *not methamphetamine*, it is a form of amphetamine called  levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine.  Vyvanse is just dextroamphetamine once the lysine amino acid is removed.  Methamphetamine is far more addictive than dextroamphetamine.  Secondly Meth when used as an illegal drug is consumed in different ways that make the high far stronger and thus far more addictive (do not shoot it up or inhale it!!!)","cl4xq5o",3,1412879584,"2014-10-09 18:33:04"
"7715","My recommendations:

Ask for help! It might feel really hard and sucky, but it's worth it!

1. Talk to all your professors and let them know what's up; see if they're willing to help you at all

2. Talk to whatever resources your school has to help you (academic coach, your advisor, a counselor, tutors, academic coach... If there is a class for academic success, you can ask the teacher to meet with you and help you make a plan)

3. Find a way to write out your assignments that isn't overwhelming, and then write them all down (I use a Google Forms spreadsheet that an academic coach made for me. One of my buddies writes out a huge handwritten list and then makes smaller lists of 5-10 items at a time from the big list)

4. Prioritize - I just look at my top 3 at a time so I don't get distracted or overwhelmed. Once I finish the top 3, I figure out what the next top 3 are. And I take a break (with a timer!) before I start in again if/when I get distracted

5. Focus on just the next step, one assignment at a time. Do this somewhere that the most interesting thing in your environment is the assignment, and put background noise on if you need it (I like using video game 'field music' or coffee shop type background noise from YT)

6. Know this: you can do it! I believe in you 🙂","ejmfrry",5,1553820449,"2019-03-29 00:47:29"

**I would highly recommend you talking about this with your husband/significant other.  I would also highly recommend talking about this with his doctor.**

1)  Some ADHD meds increased anxiety, what you said could be explained by anxiety.  ADHD unmedicated has anxiety as a common comorbidity, some adhd make this worse, or you can be fine without meds but anxiety happens due to the adhd meds.  There are meds you can add (alpha 2 agonists) that treat anxiety and adhd at the same time.  You can also take other meds to treat anxiety.  You can also go the non medicine route, there are many ways to treat anxiety.  Dealing with your feelings in a supporting atmosphere is one way, just letting out those feelings and not be afraid that they may cause bad consequences.  Make sure to exercise at least every other day, for unspent energy in your body when exposed to brain chemicals such as neurotransmitters can lead to anxiety.  There are many things he can do.

2)  It can be depression.  ADHD is often comorbid with depression.  ADHD meds do not cause depression, but messed up feedback loops with neurotransmitters cause many forms of adhd, the same type of thing can happen with depression except it is different neurotransmitters (though very related).  He may need to go on an antidepressant.

3)  His current dose for his med may be too high.  ADHD meds increase electricity to certain brain regions.  If one region is overactive you may be overly emotional almost maniac, and another is underactive.  If another region is overactive and another is under active you can be a zombie, where you deal with all the thoughts in your head but do not do anything in reality.

4)  He is not on the right med, or another ADHD med should be added.  Not all forms of ADHD are the same, the type of adhd you have is determined by your genetics and how your brain was wired during early childhood/in the womb.  There are about 5 different types of mainstream adhd meds that have vastly different ways in how they treat adhd (stimulant amphetamine salts, stimulant methylphenidate, nri, ndri, alpha 2 agonists).  Just because you receive increased focus with one type of med does not mean this is the best type of med for you, your problem may be better addressed by another type of med or a combination of meds.  Often us ADHD people once we find one type of med we like we are so amazed that we stop trying the other ones.


5)  There is something up that is not related to medication, such as increased stress in his life.  You did recently have a kid, and while he may not be anxious he may be stressed.

"7750","I've been living with my wife for a fairly long time now, and there are certain things that REALLY help.

1. Always communicate. Tell him/her how you feel, make sure they do the same. Talk about your challenges, and their challenges. Express your feelings, make sure they express theirs. Try to keep it calm.

2. Have a ""break"" rule. We have a rule where if one of us needs to step out of the situation and go for a 30 minute walk, there are absolutely no negative ramifications and we don't hold it against each other. Has turned many arguments into discussions.

3. Don't go to bed angry. Sort out stuff before you go to sleep otherwise it festers. I get fixated on negative stuff and it just gets worse and worse, so even if you lose some sleep, sort it out before bed.

4. Routine. Make one. Not a harsh minute to minute one, but a general idea of what you should be doing when.

5. Expectations. My wife is a neat freak. I am not. I have the basement, it's allowed to look like whatever I want it to. The rest of the house is (or was before our son was born) almost compulsively tidy. I knew this was how it went, so made an effort to keep my chaos away from the upstairs, but having a place to BE chaotic has really helped too.

These are the main things that we've found help. Also remember that your/your SO are human, so you're going to screw up. Badly probably. When your SO screws up, try to make it as positive an experience as possible. Getting stuck on negative stuff is an easy way to rip a relationship apart.","cs8acun",13,1434458643,"2015-06-16 12:44:03"

"7752","I have this same thing. I've been prescribed medication for years before I told my parents, but one of my cousins apparently abused prescription medications so my parents have been opposed since the moment they found out. 

A couple years ago in quick succession I was sexually assaulted, broke up with my partner of 7 years after finding out about a continual pattern of cheating, lost my job at a newspaper due to layoffs, came out as genderqueer, and got hives all over my body that required me to be on steroids (which would eventually lead to a rare side effect putting me in a wheelchair for around a year). 

I was obviously pretty depressed with all this going on, and definitely started abusing alcohol, but my parents (who are deeply religious and were very upset by my coming out) immediately saw it all as a result of my adderall, which obviously makes no sense. I haven't seen them in around three years, because they've painted me to be a drug addict because of my medication and pretty much said I won't be accepted until I go off my medication so that I can stop being genderqueer. 

No matter how much I've attempted to explain to them that the medication helps me, and that none of these things correlate with adderall use, they're firmly rooted in the idea that they can't be wrong about this. I have a hard time believing this would happen with almost any other medication, beyond maybe opiates, because of the heavy stigmatization it has. ","dwyp6iw",1,1523104192,"2018-04-07 12:29:52"

"7779","I get where you're coming from. I used to see a lot of posts where the gist felt to me like ""I failed at this common thing a lot of people fail at, and it's because of my ADHD so oh well, why bother."" Those seem to have cleared up a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of the sorts of posts I see now, there are two types - those seeking advice, and those seeking validation. For users seeking advice, like how to fix this issue or how to adjust medication, it's pretty easy to tell what responses are correct. But for those seeking validation, they aren't necessarily looking for answers right now. They know they need to fix their issue, but before anyone can fix their issue, they have to forgive themself. They have to stop hating themselves so intensely that they're stuck. That self loathing happens to me, and I notice from the posts I read that it happens to others. Learning to forgive yourself, while +not+ letting yourself off the hook for self-improvement, is the goal. Everyone in our lives thinks our disorder is a joke or a moral failing, and so we internalize it. We hate ourselves, or some of us do sometimes. Some can keep it at bay, but when you really fuck up, like panic fuck up this is a Big Fucking Deal... you need to be told that you deserve something better, that right now isn't forever and you're still a decent person and not a human sized sack of failure. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're so hard on ourselves that I'm not the least bit surprised that sometimes, in posts just looking for validation and comfort, that all we can think to say is ""It's okay. You'll be okay. We all fuck up sometimes. We all fail sometimes."" It's not saying it's okay to fail, it's saying that failing isn't the end. ","eb19d59",8,1543880274,"2018-12-03 23:37:54"
"7780","It happened to me. It took me a long time to get over it. I learned so much though, and I bet you will too. 

Sometimes there are certain aspects of a job that make that way to do the job hard. So you might need to roll into another way of working in the field. 

Above all, don't blame yourself. 

When I looked back, I realized that in many respects I was way ahead of my bosses. I saw things they didn't see. The mundane aspects of the job frustrated me a lot. For so long I beat myself up for having a bad attitude but I realized that I was dealing with a brain that was bored with these things. 

Whenever I found myself struggling, I beat myself up mercilessly. That made me perform worse and set up a bad cycle. After I was let go, I was able to unravel all this. 

I began to look at ways of working, not only fields. I asked, how can I do what I love, and work in a way that helps me be successful? 

I think most ADHD people are brilliant. The world loses so much by not recognizing this. I would say, embrace your strengths and build on them. Don't discount the idea that it just wasn't a good fit. Learn what you need to learn. But most of all, dwell on what you do well. I would say the most important thing is to do whatever it takes to fight getting down. 
Take walks, make lists of your strengths, think about what you really want and congratulate yourself for any daily success. 

When I was really down, I would walk and ask myself, ""What if I look back and see that this was the turning point to make my life amazing? What if this is actually the beginning of something better than I could have imagined?"" It pretty much turned out that way too. ","dw14jmn",2,1521601216,"2018-03-21 03:00:16"

I'm in the states. The wait in Buffalo (howdy neighbor) is about 8 months. I called for an appointment in June 2016, forgot about it, got laid off from work, and FINALLY got a reminder call in February that my appointment was that week (woohoo - I was off of work anyway due to not having work!)

I was kind of angry going in. My primary doc wouldn't prescribe anything - he said he won't diagnose ADHD. He did refer me to the doctor I'm seeing now, but it was a ""just call this guy"" referral, and not a direct referral. 

Anyway, I was told numerous times that they don't diagnose ADHD, but to come in anyway. Discouraged, and a bit down on myself for being jobless, I went in, hoping that they would at least give me depression meds, and possibly a dreaded neuropsych exam ($3000 US) to see if I have ADHD. 

I went in, and amazingly, within about 15 minutes, I was out with a diagnosis, a script, and confirmation that I had ADHD. 

I think they just discourage pill seekers with that nonsense about neuropsych exams, but I bet plenty of places still do them. 

Anyway, after breaking down and completely losing my shit crying in the car, I picked up my script and I've been doing much better. 

***

Anyway - I was prepared to shop around. If that doctor wouldn't give me an evaluation, I would have kept going until I found someone that would. If I had to go into credit card debt paying in full each doctor just to get a diagnosis, I would have (sad fact about the states unfortunately).

I think my answer is ""**Yes, but..."".**

Yes I can definitely finish a university degree, but I can't listen in lectures, I can't start doing homework unless it's due in like 3 hours or something crazy and I'm only going to University when I have to and when there's a test. I've been working in my field since the first year so my focus has shifted to my job so keep that in mind. BTW my grades are not bad, I can get a lot of studying in 3-4 days before the test.

You can solve complex problems with ADHD by compensating with time, and I definitely compensate by throwing 4 hours on a 1 hour problem just so I can get that actual 1 hour of net work.

What's in the past is in the past, try sticking with Ritalin and titrate the dose up if Concerta worked for you, like I said they're the same, just Concerta is the long lasting version.  It sounds like from what you've described your ideal dose is going to be around 30mg Ritalin.  When you're trying new ones because it's new you react stronger and then get ""tolerant"" once you level out that stops.  The euphoria will go away but the benefits will stay.

The good news is people like us don't stay unhappy. We get there, but our minds are good at bouncing back to their normal levels of happiness after a few weeks. At least that's been my experience, and I hope it's yours too. 

Go easy on yourself, and tell whatever part of your brain that's so mad at you to ease up, because most people couldn't ever manage all the stress your disorder puts in your life, and 99% of the time I bet you've kept a stiff upper lift. So what if you feel like shit for a spell, that's not your fault. You're entitled to be down, but you shouldn't believe that it will last or that hope is really lost. It's not. You just don't feel like looking at the good part right now maybe. Soon you will, and you'll be right back along your path again.

If you feel you can do the performance plan, give it your best. And definitely don't wait until 90 days for the feedback. You should be checking in with your boss every week to track progress on the goals. Write down that progress every day so you have a report of what you've accomplished toward it. Back up these conversations on email so there is written record. 

Since it seems you do have a diagnosis it might be worth bringing up with HR to see if there are accommodations they could give that would directly improve your performance. It couldn't hurt you at that point to at least ask. 

Also - definitely be sending out job applications. If this doesn't work out you don't want to be caught without at least a couple of leads on other jobs. Does not hurt to play it safe. ","djgd7uc",2,1498547531,"2017-06-27 07:12:11"
"7806","I'm not so keen on consistency. I don't like the way I feel kinda robotic when I'm on it for too long, so I plan days off work when I can go unmedicated.

That you're so... disengaged from the life you've lead thus far seems to show that you're having trouble expressing how yourself you are to the people who've cared about you.

Neuro-normal is a weird place... people that are normally fun, funny, exciting, can notice this change in us when we're medicated, and they usually don't react well. Maybe your best friend is usually insecure, smartass, and unfriendly (in any traditional sense) and now you're picking up on it more. Maybe he's got things going on, and seeing you change like this isn't making life easier, even if it isn't the only thing going on - though good luck getting him to even acknowledge such to himself. Let's be honest, its probably a bit of both cases.

While I too get a similar hyperactivity and/or drabness to the world (sometimes seeming induced by Meds), I want to remind you to be careful. Some of that ""lack of color"" to the world is a sort of social feedback loop from how I'm still learning how to interact with people when properly medicated. Some days, I can come off like I'm from some frozen planet where emotions are just less vivid, and others like I'm frankly untamed, even while medicated.

Just don't make any rash decisions, and try to communicate these concerns to your prescribing doctor.

As a cautionary tale, I want to point you to the life of one Mathematician who laid the groundwork for how data is routed around the internet - Paul Erdos. He was an infamous amphetamine addict, a pharmaceutical which acted as a prototype for many of the stimulant meds prescribed to us. I do not doubt that your behavior on the meds, or mine, shares some similar neuropharmacological roots as his.

As a young man, he was apparently even charismatic. He had his charm slowly overwritten with idiosyncracies... until he was a celebrity for being such a loveable, productive, prolific madman. His odd life choices, even before amphetamines didn't help either. http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/portrait-of-paul-erdos/

"7809","&gt;When i say no, he flips out. This is when I get mad, I tell him he knowingly started another video to make me feel that he was 'almost done'. 

Just a bit of feedback that comes to mind when reading this: Here you are saying that when he gets pissed off, you essentially accuse him of trying to trick you. This can send a message of, ""Hey, you have no right to get frustrated -- you knew that you were running out of time!""

Now, it's true, he was trying to push your boundaries. However, if good and normal children never tested boundaries that adults set for them... why would they need adults to set them in the first place? Don't get me wrong -- I can completely understand why you were getting angry. Why would he start another video if he knows it is going to make everything more unpleasant when you make him stop the video? It doesn't make sense! But... kids. I don't know that there *is* a better answer than kid-brain (and/or still-developing frontal lobes).

You setting limits and him testing them is the way of nature -- not necessarily a devious, impish act of ill-will and subterfuge on his part. In other words, a good parent sets boundaries -- but it is not true that good children obey them *just because*. Children respect limits that have been consistently and reliably enforced (though they may still test them occasionally); that is why they need caregivers. The ""good child"" who never tested their caregiver's boundaries and who always obeyed ""just because"" is a fantasy, a myth. (Or, a child who *already* tested their boundaries sometime before you met them, and found them to be rock-solid!)

What this also means is that this doesn't have to be a battle of wills. It is an inevitability of nature -- a heavy rock tumbling down a steep cliffside. He will test your boundaries because he can do no other thing, and you will set the limits and hold to them in a dispassionate way, because you are simply a law of nature in action. Imagine:

""Time's up, kiddo.""     
""Aw man, this has 8 minutes left!! Can I continue it? Pleeeeaassseeee?""      
""Nope, you'll have to bookmark it for later.""          
""Come ooooooonnnnn!""     
""No. Turn it off, now.""         
""GOSH, you're so unreasonable!! Like it is going to make *that* much of a difference if I go to bed 8 minutes later. Ooooooh *noooooo*, I missed 8 minutes of sleep! It's the *end of the world*!""       
""Yeah, I know, kiddo. It's frustrating when you run out of time to do what you want. It sucks.""** 

How do you think that might change the interaction? Sure, he might just mumble back, ""*You* suck."" I would guess even then, there may be a change in tone -- less hostile, less combative. You haven't evoked a battle. You just set this boundary, and were fair, firm, and compassionate. ** This last part especially: If you can really get into his shoes and empathize with his feelings, and *mean* it when you say it, you can help model for him how you want him to respond to the boundaries he runs into for the rest of his life (including those he sets on himself to meet long-term goals). ""Yeah, this isn't fun, and I don't like it... but that's okay. It is the way that it is, and I don't *have* to like it.

For the long term side-effects of ADHD medication, I think it's important to see them in a more 'holistic' way (crappy word, but the most accurate I can think of). 

Like, when I take my medication I'm eating better, moving around more, suffer a lot less stress because I'm no longer either running on the adrenaline from a deadline or feel like shit about things I forgot to do. My home doesn't turn into a health-hazard, I'm less likely to not notice a car when crossing the street, I sleep better, I drink less, etc. etc.

I know the health benefits you get from being on meds/not on them varies from person to person. Someone who already works out a lot to help them cope with the ADHD and perhaps has a partner who just loves to cook healthy meals, will benefit less from them health wise as I do. 

But no matter if the benefits you get are big or small, I do think it's important to keep them into account when you think about the effects medication has on your health.

Everything is exactly where it belongs. I rent 1 room (with an ensuite), but I also clean the shared spaces twice a week.

My room at home is a complete mess. There isn't garbage or dirty dishes or anything, it's just that there's too much stuff and nothing is in the right place. My bedroom has pretty much always been like this, no matter how many times I've tried re-organizing.

I think it's like this because in my apartment I only have the things I need. It's very minimalist. So it's easy to keep clean because there's not much there. My room at home is full of everything: things I need, things I rarely use but still need to keep, and things I keep for sentimental reasons. There's more stuff to keep track of, so it's harder to keep clean.

"7879","Thank you for the wonderful reply. 

&gt;the anxiety, depression, panic, fear, anger and other negative emotions that come from not being able to get work done is something that a lot of people with ADHD have experienced. It's a vicious cycle that we've all been through: you can't focus or can't get work done or don't do work for whatever reason which causes you to fall behind. You struggle to catch up but can't and struggle doing the work you currently have to do. Things pile up and things begin to look more dire and you start to feel helpless, buried and then the anxiety sets it.

Wow, just wow. You have completely summed up my life. I believe all this time I have been misdiagnosed with anxiety, when it was truly ADHD all along. I see my doctor in 3 weeks, and I think I will actually write this out to say to him because it describes it perfectly.

I agree with everything you are saying. I feel like when I took the Adderall, it didn't do the work for me; it made me ABLE to to the work I needed to do and made me ABLE to set my priorities straight, create a list of things to do, and DO them! Normally, I simply cannot organize my thoughts. Like you said, Adderall put air in my flat tires, but I had to provide the gas. 

I didn't have anxiety at all while taking it, which leads me to believe that again, I have been misdiagnosed. I have tried Strattera before (he gave it to me to try because it is a non-stimulant) and it did absolutely nothing for me. So I think I need something a little more stronger. 

So you believe that I should be honest with my doctor about taking the Adderall from a friend? I don't want to cause trouble, but I feel he needs to know how much the medication helped me those two days. ","cvzpv4i",2,1444849242,"2015-10-14 19:00:42"

He went outside, shutting the storm door behind him, and walked down a few stairs leading to the yard. He rolled up his right jacket sleeve, held his fist out in front of him superman-style, and ran full force up the stairs into the door where he smashed his hand through the bottom glass.

"7885","It may not be the right sub for extensive discussion on such topics, but that was a foolish and insultingly dismissive way to reduce the story of one’s life - all the hardships and experiences along one’s way - to one factor that you’ve gleaned from a 2 sentence comment. It isn’t to say that white privilege doesn’t exist (it very clearly does), or that race isn’t a big factor in determining the lives of American individuals - I can personally attest to these, being a minority myself, and having recently experienced anti-Asian racism as of late. But humans are not binary. Life is way more complicated than that.

Judging people based on such simplistic systems only ignores the many complex injustices that don’t fit a cookie cutter mold, and inevitably ends up perpetuating the cycle of injustice by doing so. It is often repeated that bigotry originates from ignorance, but I believe it’s more precisely, a specific form of it - the incomprehension of, or the unwillingness to accept, the possibility of nuance. This boils down to a lack of empathy, the lack of the capacity to understand and sympathize with the feelings and experiences of others. It is no moral victory to exchange one form of bigotry for another. One cannot pursue true social justice in this country while denying or downplaying reality of the existence of racism - or conversely, reducing one’s viewpoint to revolve rigidly around this factor. 

Let me remind you that we are - and I say this at the risk of sounding kitschy - mere human beings, insecure, confused, short-lived beings on the edge of despair. I don’t think of it often, but when I do, it is so astounding to see how fragile we are. We are more than often just a few steps - bankruptcy, romantic rejection, death of family, and other perceived catastrophes - away from completely losing all our sense of meaning in life. Instead of acting morally superior and looking at others with contempt, you should treat your fellow human with affection, for all we can do to relieve the misery of our short and existentially ambiguous existences is to forgivingly commiserate with each other, with full knowledge of our own imperfections.","gsvy37t",1,1617170282,"2021-03-31 05:58:02"

"7887","TLDR, ADHDers, our youth probably sucked in ways we don't need to tolerate as adults, yet we often continue to abuse ourselves to fit some mold anyway. The thirties are the best for shedding this, though no reason not to have a head start. 

29? oh, you have no idea, learning this lesson was the  GIFT of my 30s. I was so dreading being in my thirties, thinking ""you can't be 30 and still have no solid career plan and life plan and blah blah""and then thirty happened and like, nothing fell apart. I just started shedding all that ""normalizing"" shit I grew up with. started realizing that my parents/ex-bosses/ex-boyfriends, etc weren't around to say shit to me anymore. It was me. I was repeating their words over and over, envisioning their disappointment, screw it. There is still this bit of trying to build an identify for myself without constantly looking for approval from other people, especially people who don't approve. Its a work in progress, a journey, and should be enjoyed, when possible. But yeah, like checklists? I'm so over the checklist, the ""where do you see yourself in 5 years, blah blah"" I have no effing idea, but you know what? I don't know that it matters. I have had a LOT of different careers, I get bored easily and like to try new things...I kind of find it comforting NOT to know where I'm supposed to be 5 years from now...also, normal is boring. Plus, I think a lot of ""goal-setting guides"" were built for extroverts and people really motivated by power, prestige and money. Introverts with different values don't always fit these sorts of expectations. I am not married (though I am in a relationship) and have no kids (by choice) and most people are surprised I'm 41(f). Like, that wasn't my path. I didn't ""fail"" at family, though some people might think that. I will say, sometimes friends drift apart, the ones with kids with the ones who don't, that happens, but I'm happier with just a few close friends I really care about and are healthy people for me to connect with. (I also shed a lot of those parasite people who did a serious number on my psyche). And I keep my family at arms length. I love them and supported my mom through her surgery, but she isn't a good influence on me, so I don't let her words hurt me anymore. On and on I go, sorry!!!  As adults, we can manage to build our lives to suit our brains, we never got to do that as kids. We couldn't just disregard what parents say about us, sit wherever we are comfortable or just not sit if we don't want to! We can have nice tidy offices or work in every room in the house. we can have the music we want, or the silence we want. I think in my twenties I was still playing the ""fit the mold"" game and then at thirty, fuck it, pretzels for breakfast! I'm enjoying the freedoms to be the adult I AM, not the kid they WANTED me to be.

ADHD is an umbrella term for disorganization, distraction, and an inability to control emotions (at least according to someone I know whose son specializes in treatment of ADHD adolescents).  My son learned to study with others as a way to keep him on task.  

Having said that, I'm not sure this group is open to considering other reasons for a possible diagnosis of ADHD, like the kid whose sister is a valedictorian and who is overwhelmed with lots to do to meet his parents' expectations.

ADHD is a real thing.  I do not doubt it.  It's a matter of how to treat it.  I'm an advocate for looking at specific problem areas and addressing them, such as learning how to study better.  The problem I see with getting a diagnosis of ADHD is you are spending time looking at you as a problem  (how your brain functions) rather than specific behaviors (dividing study time between Facebook and studying) that can be addressed with different behaviors like forming study groups.

I was maybe 5 weeks into the job, as a part timer around classes.  The day before the owner of the company had asked me to bring a couple parts from the office to where he was working on a customer site (first time on site for me, I had been doing board level electronic repair upto that point only.). The intent was I hand off the part, and go back to the office.  He tells me to stay, and learn.

It gets stupid late that night, and he, the customer, and I all call it.  Head home.

On the way up in the morning, he asks if I want to go full time, as a bench and service tech.  (What I was doing, and also going out to customer site for on site diagnostic/repair if possible/installation/modification).  Once my jaw came back into my head, I accepted.  Of course after I graduated.

From that job, after about 18 months, I got a better offer from a customer went there for a while (I was TOLD by my soon to be boss, AND his boss to apply, and they would back the app), while there, got my to date only raise, was offered basically the department I was in, AND the IT department they wanted to start, told them where to shove the entire company, went back to the service job for about 2 years, leading the robot division, until my boss took on a job we shouldn't have taken, against everyone's advice for way under what we should have charged.","eha6ni6",1,1551138215,"2019-02-25 23:43:35"

Used to pick fights with kids, even straight punched one in the face for the thrill of it. I think I may have stole minor things from kids before, and must have been called down to the principals office daily, at least twice a week. I was forgetful but I also lied to cover it up. Had the police called on me once as a way to scare me for bringing in a jar of tobasco sauce I said was tobacco. Nearly stabbed some kid through the eye with my pencil when he stabbed me in the hand (I poked him a bit beforehand, so I provoked it). 

It all started to settle down when I picked a fight with someone two grades above me and lost horrendously. Avoided fighting after that. Around that time I think I was put on concerta and my grades improved, and so did my attitude. Went from being extremely aggressive to more passive, or at least passive-aggressive. I'm seen as the 'good kid' who's in college and getting all A's and B's instead of in jail like most of my cousins. I'm on Adderall XR now and it helps me significantly when it comes to grades and motivation.

I've had this with 4 different people, the first 3 I left too long... they ended up on pedestals and I didn't have the confidence to ask them out. The 4th one, we got a long well and those thoughts started occurring, I asked her out the very next time I saw her.

It's hard, I really don't know what to say but I don't want to leave you to stew. Obviously I got lucky in that she was genuinely interested in dating me too but I felt getting the question out of the way earlier is better.

What's weird is I don't have much social anxiety or anything. All my anxiety seems to come from my ADHD. I think it comes when I feel I've lost control of my reality. Which, of course, is an illusion. Because I never controlled it in the first place.

I'm always scared of forgetting things, losing things, being late, etc. I feel forced to keep trinkets so I can remember memories. I keep all my photos. I never throw things away. It all stems from this primal instinct to make sure everything stays the same and I don't fuck up.

And all these thoughts are accompanied by a physical panic, a rush. And that rush kind of drives me to fix the leak in my boat right this second because if I don't the entire ship will sink. When one problem arises I attack it like it's a literal life or death situation, as a kind of coping mechanism to prevent my ADHD from ruining everything. 

Meds make this better and worse, it varies. But usually I feel more in control on meds and I don't have to panic because my meds handle the micro and allow my brain to focus on the macro and what I actually want to do. ","dqgico3",5,1511884138,"2017-11-28 15:48:58"

Have you tried other medications other than Concerta? Maybe it isn't the right medication for you? You are a sophomore, your second year of high school right? I highly suggest talking to your doctor about your medication since if it is not working for you, why continue taking it. I would suggest trying other medications to see what works for you sooner than later, it is no fun being all loopy before important assessments and assignments. Depending on your school they may possibly accommodate you during the time it takes you to adjust to a medication.

"7980","A lot of people are like that now, ADHD or not. Think about how many people have to play with their phone at the same time as watching a show/movie for the extra stimulation/novelty. It’s just the way we condition ourselves with constant stimulation.

I’m also the same way. Most TV/movies are boring enough because I’ve watched every show and movie I’ve wanted to see and at a certain point, it just kinda becomes more of the same. 

When my meds wear off, it’s usually timed for the evening because I’m not productive at all after. And fortunately I have the short acting dose so it won’t impede my sleep.

"7993","This.

I think by us (doesn't matter if we have ADHD ourselves or somebody in our family does) staying silent on the issue we're making things softer short term, but worse in the long.

Like with any other mental issue or neurountipicality, people do not understand what it means until it hits home.  My son was diagnosed recently when things have become absolutely disastrous. Now, looking back, we easily could've prevented most of the damage 3 years ago if I, or literally anybody in his school, was aware of the ADHD.

It's a great shame, that we, as a society, all too easily fall back to ""you just need to cheer up"" to depression, ""you just need to try harder"" for ADHD and any other numbers of ""you just"". It's a very common problem for things that are not visually/measurably obvious like missing legs, fallen off noses, high fever or anything. But it's inevitable. We can compassionate only if we have similar experiences. 

The other day somebody here has drawn parallels with LGBT community. I think it's very valid. They had to go through decades of hiding, shaming, stigmatization and punishment for just being the way they are. There's a very good movie about that: [Pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_(2014_film)). My takeaways in regards to ADHD would be 

1. Like with any other bullying, it continues as long as the bully sees the hurting result. ""Squirrel!"" Why the fuck not and proud about it.
2. Hiding doesn't work. It might hurt us but it will help future generations. About 10% of kids are diagnosed. I'd guess another 5% don't get a chance to get diagnosed. That means in a random group of 10 people, 1-2 will have ADHD. And mocked.

If you stumble on this (thinking out loud)

1. At workplace. Most countries have anti-discrimination laws.
2. In private life. If you see the person might listen to the reason, try to bring an analogy that is close to home. Depression has gotten a lot of visibility (and it's great!) so virtually everyone has personal or from-relative experience with it.
3. Some people are just jerks. Poor them. They have to live with themselves their whole lives.","e4gpcmx",5,1534689938,"2018-08-19 14:45:38"

I felt that way nearly 95% of the time, desperate for something more interesting or stimulating. Now, I feel more calm.

I still feel like my thinking style is more creative than the average person's due to the fact that I make odd connections in my head, and I don't really miss the crazy-fast thinking that happened before I  started medication.

If you are more comfortable with ""natural medicine"" at Johns wort is quite good for depression. But be warned that it also has its own side effects and counteracts almost every drug on the market. Including birth control. Many of the supplements may help, however they are unregulated and can be significantly more dangerous than prescriptions from a Dr. I know this because I have had some bad things happen with herbal supplements, and side effects significantly worse than anything I've had with a prescription.

"8030","If you feel like a problem is about to arise during your work, and AD/HD is apart of it, that is the last opportunity you will get to get protection from Americans with Disabilities Act, but you would have to disclose beforehand.

You should first however ask for accommodations without disclosing. (helpful software to keep you on due dates, time management, extensions for big projects, a file cabinet that will help you keep organized YOUR way) &lt; things like that. But it is best to not ask for them with the word ""disability"" in the sentence. You don't want to put your Boss and HR on the defensive if they believe you might sue. 

If you are unable to get accommodations, you should consider disclosing. 

Under the ADA, you are under no obligation to disclose, but if you are about to get fired and disclose you have ADHD, ADA may not apply.

Under US Law, you are entitled to legal protections against getting fired for having a disability; but you must disclose you have the disability and your employer must have at least 15 employees. You must also be able to prove that you are capable of doing your work with ""reasonable accommodations"". Something like this could be a quieter part of the office to help you avoid distractions. 

To disclose and get ADA protections, you must do so in writing and you must have documentation that proves your diagnosis and that your ADHD affects your ability to work compared to someone without ADHD. 

Disclosing however can put you at risk for not getting advancement. If you have solid job performance however, I don't see why this should be an issue. If you feel you need to disclose, try to educate your boss about ADHD, if possible having an ADHD expert (psychologist perhaps) to answer their questions. 

Try to get what you need WITHOUT disclosing first.

"8038","tldr; Chrome is good at storing passwords, if you secure your Google account well. I do other stuff too. 

If you use Chrome, storing passwords with a logged-in Google account seems to be pretty secure, if you have two-step authentication on. (disclaimer: i am not a security professional, but i work in tech and have a bajillion passwords) It happens automatically (usually it will ask) and is reusable in more places now (the latest version of Android will ask if you want to use Chrome to fill in passwords for apps, for instance).

Muscle memory is the best way of remembering passwords, which is why reusing passwords is so common. The more you type it, the easier it is to remember. My normal technique used to be to add some letters from the start of the site's domain name to the front of a reused password root, and then some of the name to the end. Usually, if I am guessing one of my own passwords, this technique works. Make sure the root (middle) part of your password has enough different types of characters to satisfy various requirements, and you're good.

My current technique is using KeePass, which is a way of storing your passwords in an encrypted database file that you own. I keep mine in cloud storage, and there are ways to read from it on every platform I use (Chrome, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS). It can generate strong passwords and even though it's another step to do when creating a password, I've made it work. I started using this after locking myself out of LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane... maybe others. ","dpvft5x",1,1510776234,"2017-11-15 20:03:54"

Pick a time everyday that you can start doing your homework, it doesn’t matter when it is just make it so that at that time everyday you can do your homework. If you can only do 30 minutes that day, you only do 30 minutes. The work you get done doesn’t matter as much as you do it that time everyday. The most important days are the ones you can only mustard out the energy to do a couple of minutes, because if you keep it when it’s hard to then it’s easy to keep when it’s easy. Ik it sounds really stupid and basic but it’s a lot easier to keep a constant schedule when you’re going and doing things vs having a lot of time and can do it all from home. Especially with adhd because if you never have to leave the place you do your work then there’s always time to “do it later”

"8065","I should note before I answer that I am on a very high dose, and I also haven't taken my meds for a while due to being off uni, which can exacerbate side effects whenever I go back on it. You're on 5mg, (or 10? if it's half a pill? idk) and I'm on 45mg. I also have an unrelated liver condition, which could affect the way I process drugs like this. This is only one experience.

Having said that, here's what I, personally have noticed.

Side effects:  
\-Barely any hunger, and then exacerbated hunger once they wear off  
\-Inability to feel tired until late into the night (usually cause I took them too late for them to wear off in time)  
\-Zoning out a ton  
\-Caffiene make me go heeheeHEHHEHEHEHEHEHE (my heartrate goes through the roof and I bounce like a basketball on a trampoline. Your mileage may vary, especially as I take caffeine so rarely that it hits me hard even when I'm off my meds, but this could be a combination you want to avoid)  
\-Alcohol is WAY more potent. Not really sure why. I become the biggest of lightweights. I don't encourage mixing them, but at first I didn't know you weren't supposed to do this, so I did it a few times. I'm fine, but I don't drink much anyway.

Side note: I don't know if you take any other substances - whilst I and friends I have who have experienced combinations of these have never had a bad time with them, you should absolutely be avoiding them or at the very least googling a trusted medical source (e.g. [NHS.uk](https://NHS.co.uk)) to check before engaging in drug combinations. They can be very dangerous.

Personally, none of these side effects tend to be dealbreakers. They're annoying, but I have workarounds for most of them, and some people choose to use the side effects to their advantage - anything from people who want to spend less on alcohol by combining drugs (which is dangerous and you should not do) to using the hunger side effect to win an eating challenge. 

In terms of the intended effects, it normally manifests in me sitting down to do 5 minutes of work and finding out 6 hours have passed and I've written 30 pages or something like that. It's much easier to fall into a workflow and stay in that workflow. It's also much easier to not be distracted, which can be annoying in a team environment - rather than zoning out, it's like zoning \*in\* to the work. You usually won't notice it until suddenly you're just working and working and working.

For an example, I would like to note I do not condone abuse of medications in any way, but I heard a story from a friend of a friend who did choose to do so. He reported taking a slightly larger dose than mine, and subsequently doing 3 month's uni work in a single day. I say this not to encourage that sort of abuse, but to demonstrate that these drugs are powerful, and allow you to do insane amounts of work when used properly.

This may seem a little foreboding and heavy on drug mentions. It's because I want to encourage you to be careful. These are strong medications and they have strong effects, even in smaller doses. I know that telling people ""don't do drugs"" often goes unheard, so if you do go against the advice and choose to do so, please be aware of the risks.","ghtq5mo",1,1609594680,"2021-01-02 13:38:00"

"8076","There’s “our stuff” and “his stuff” and “my stuff” in my relationship. I know for a fact that I am much messier than my partner. So when I walk into a room, I try to make a note of how much of “my stuff” is out of place vs “his stuff” and try to take care of at least the most egregious messiness (for both of us) 
He also is good at grabbing my stuff that I’ve left out and putting it in a landing place so when he does move something of mine, I can go check that spot before I lose my mind trying to find it. 

I know for a FACT that my messiness bothers him and this is the best way of dealing with it so far. I typically remember when I actually put something away, so I am terrible at remembering to look for things where they actually go! 

We’ve clashed over my utter inability to check the mail, and have finally agreed that he will check the mail and I will sort it. 

We’ve also made a lot of activity checklists for things like laundry or grocery shopping. i.e. do we have the list, the cooler bag, the ice packs, the reusable bags. . . 

We also have specific days for things, like Saturday morning is when we clean everything. 

I’m lucky to be with a very patient man, and we definitely had several clashes over stuff when we first started living together. We’re on year three now and still working on having a smooth household, but clashes are few and far between.

"8077","I very much agree with this and 2nd this advice.

Every single decongestant I know off and a quick look at wikipedia as well interacts with adderall for they all work as norepinephrine receptor agonists, or they are drugs that are structurally similar to amphetamine and effectively they are causing neurotransmitter release that then interacts with the norepinephrine receptors that trigger the decongestant effect.

For example pseudophedrine structurally is like a cross between amphetamine molecule and norepinephrine losing some of the traits of norepinephrine and gaining some of the traits of amphetamine (plus an extra methyl group). 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

To put simply it is not a question of whether you can find a decongestant that interacts with adderall **for all of them will**, it is a question of which decongestant should you use **for it has the least interaction with adderall**, and for that information you need to be talking to a medical expert with the pharmacist being the best person most likely to know the answer due to his medical schooling but also because he gets these questions daily while a primary care doctor is such a generalist he may not know the answer.

#Talk to your pharmacist.

I do not know the answer, and most of the people on the internet will not have the medical background to give you the answer you need.


-----

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Now antihistamines are a different subject than decongestants for they interact with different neurotransmitter systems than the decongestants, but at the same time the neurotransmitter systems they interact with have a large degree of overlap with the target systems of amphetamine and thus there are still interactions just interactions that are a few degrees removed (think cousins or neighbors to use a metaphor) so my advice is still talk to a pharmacist.","d2sapj7",3,1462362049,"2016-05-04 11:40:49"

"8091","TIP for reading and not feeling overwhelmed by book choices. One great tip I have for anyone who is starting to read again on their own terms is creating an amazon list. Mine is private and is called books of interest. I think it really helps me because you can continuously add and re-edit the list (Move up the 5th book to first, etc). When I'm just about done with a book - the day before or so, I order the next book on my list. Sometimes I have one at the top of my list but then I can look at the list and whichever one speaks to me how I'm feeling and what I think I'd be able to sink my teeth into, I just order that one. It's always cool to recieve a new book right when I finish and set it up near my bed for the next day. Funny enough, I just go done reading Driven to Distraction and I'm getting a new book today. It's also really cool to see my library grow. I just started really reading books that interest me about 3 years ago.

"8123","Hey, if you're feeling really bad, there's nothing wrong with trying medication. You'd be surprised, it may very well help. Can I ask what's causing your resistance to it? Maybe I can provide some reassurance?

Its certainly possible that you have ADHD and that's contributing to your distress, but it seems very likely to me that you do have a mood disorder such as depression and anxiety. I'm not a psychologist, but I have been a patient in the mental health system for 10+ years for anxiety and depression. Until your mood disorder is being appropriately treated, its going to be very difficult to tell what problems aren't part of it. 

In regards to your talks with your psychologist, they usually feel that it is best practice to just let the patient lead the conversation wherever their train of thought takes them, but this does not work for everyone, especially if you do have ADHD, since your attention may wander to topics that are not actually what you want to talk about. If you think it will help, be frank with her and tell her you want more directed sessions that include specific skills you can learn or tackling specific thoughts or areas of your life that you are struggling with.

Thats not what lazy looks like. In fact, I probably put way more mental energy into the things I accomplish than others do. And sometimes I put in loads of mental energy with very poor end results.

And that work has not been easy. I needed years of therapy and I’m still not totally where I want to be in terms of self assurance and confidence. I still have my bad days too.

But caring so deeply about what other people think can be kind of self fulfilling prophecy. I know that I used to be much more clingy and codependent. 

Now, I’m myself and other people can take that or leave it because I can take it, love it, choose to be true to myself and honest with the people in my life.

It can be fucking rough to feel like an alien all the time. But it is possible to figure out how to separate what you can control from what you can’t—and people respond positively to self assurance, figuring out how to accept myself has turned out to be the key to finding acceptance from other people.

Not from everybody. But that part can’t hurt me the way it used to because I know who I am and what I want and I’ve made the changes I needed to make.

This is absolutely something you can see a therapist about or read a self help workbook over. I really liked *The Happiness Trap.*

"8162","This is one of those creepy ""holy shit are you me?"" comments - the sims part got to me.  Such a stressful game and never enough time in the day!

To add some commentary to OP's question, I'll mention three tricks I use.  

1) Detailed action oriented lists ( scientifically proven to be more effective).  Don't write ""fix bike"".  Write ""get tire levers, remove tire, replace tube, put tire back on, inflate"".  Reduces stress/procrastination, helps set realistic time goals.

2) Convince yourself to just do the first part of the project as listed in point 1).  The whole project seems overwhelming, but get tire levers is pretty easy.  Funny thing is after you do step one you often want to do the rest.  Convincing yourself you can always opt out paradoxically reduces procrastination.

3) Do one thing per day, that you want to do, that requires effort, and isn't a daily life maintenance task like dishes or homework.  Multitasking is something we want to do but actually suck at, it's typically inefficient, just gives the illusion of productivity, and robs you of the satisfaction of completion. I know it's hard but, damn it, just do the other thing tomorrow ;).

Also meds :P.  It is too hard for me right now to live up to any system otherwise - but I do need both.

I also find myself blanking out when people are talking to me and I have no idea where I went or what was said. 

I can mitigate this in phone calls, because I find that if I do two things at once, it's easier for me to focus and be present, so I tend to doodle (3D circles, squares, etc, nothing to intricate that involves imagination) while the other person is talking, and somehow it keeps me present. 

Just a note about adderall and off days. I know everyone's experience on meds will be different, but for me, if I take adderall (or any adhd stimulant, I've tried them all) for several days, if I skip a day, it's harder for me to function than just my pre-medicated ADHD state.

I get maybe 10-15 hours of actual work done during my 40 hour work week, and I’ve slowly been becoming depressed knowing that I am undeserving of the pay I am getting, knowing it is inevitable my boss is going to confront me soon, knowing that continuing to put my work aside and missing meetings is going to backfire, and yet i STILL can’t manage to be productive because I just blame it on the ADHD and don’t even care about getting fired anymore. I realized sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day is not for me, and I need a change sooner rather than later. I took 20mg Adderall a few times back in college to study for finals (and felt guilty about being so lazy that I needed drugs to focus) and it felt like putting on glasses for the first time.. like the cloud hovering over my brain drifted away and I could finally think clearly. I know if I get the necessary medication I could do my job somewhat effectively, but I know it’s too late and I should just start fresh at a new company and build more confidence knowing I can manage my symptoms.","fah032t",1,1576075963,"2019-12-11 14:52:43"

Ask if you can start with a small dose like 10mg and then try doing a task, how is your focus? Try 2 days of that dose, then go up to 20mg, same thing until you find the point where you can function but are not hyped up.

Other questions you need to ask yourself is: am I dealing with just ADHD? You sound like you also have depression, or ring of fire ADHD so might need an anti-depressant or an anti-pyschotic on the side or wellburtin along with your adhd medication.

Other things to try would be to try and stabilize your life as much as possible with schedules, routines, exercise, regular healthy meals, sleeping, etc.

"8180","As you age, your brain continues to mature throughout your 20’s. Things that are challenging for you today will get easier in two or three years. So there’s hope in just waiting for your development to catch up to your responsibilities.

But you have to keep struggling. Struggle creates growth and development. Over the course of years, those that continue to struggle (regardless of where they are in absolute terms) will do relatively better than their peers. I can’t back that statement up with research, but anecdotally I’m pretty confident in it. 

The trick is to try to find a way to stick with it (which is of course exactly what we are bad at).

For me, it’s avoiding poverty. The experience of poverty has always stuck with me, even though it was temporary. I use the memory of poverty sometimes on a weekly basis to motivate myself to do unpleasant things.

It’s also about not letting my team down. I’m terrible at doing things for myself, but halfway decent at doing things for others.

"8203","This is a great tip!

I'm writing up some research at the moment and facing a colossal word count in a short space of time. To add to the challenge, I constantly get sidetracked because something I'm writing sparks another idea. When working on a paragraph I'll think of something that applies in a different paragraph and immediately jump there. Or worse, I might jump out of writing mode altogether: I'll go and look at an earlier piece of analysis or some journal article... Or a news article... Or writing tips... Or this subreddit! What started as a writing session quickly descends into procrastination. The effect on the text is unfinished sentences and half-baked ideas. (Not ideal when you're trying to explain something coherently!)

I can't really do without to-do lists. But to be honest, most days there's only a slim chance I'll actually complete the tasks I lay out for myself.

So I've been trying out this ""about-todo list"" just now, and it's actually proving very helpful to get a kind of ""single focus"". Time will tell, of course, if it actually sticks. But it's been working for the past couple of hours at least :)

What's worked best so far is to have a fairly uniform and simple system for the less-used stuff.  Frequently-used stuff gets more attention.  Right now the less-used stuff gets racks of standardized shelving bins, grouped alphabetically by category.  If the categorization isn't obvious to me, it goes into whatever category my favorite supplier would list it in.  Bins that get too full get split into two or more categories.

It's not perfect but it means that instead of rummaging through piles and boxes of stuff I have only a handful of places to look and I might have to sort through two or three small bins.  The frustration from not being able to find something I know I have is more damaging to my productivity than not being able to find the thing.

Projects that spread out and take desk or bench space get baking sheets or cafeteria trays.  You can fit 20 or 40 of them in a rolling bakery rack that you can probably find cheap from a restaurant supply store.

"8223","*After writing my dribble below, I think we both are basically saying the same thing and I'm not sure why we are dueling?*

A major problem is the method they are using to asses the results has too much variation, as proved by their placebo results. The results for the drug group didn't really show any real benefit to treat ADHD, as their line  
&gt;The results did not show a statistically significant finding on the intent to treat population evaluated on the primary endpoint.  

Which is a fancy and confusing way to say 'It shows no improvement on treating ADHD compared to the placebo.' They word it the way they did to minimise perceived negativity trying to keep their shareprice from tumbling.  
With these company reports it's important to look at what they don't say. The report on the phase iii results has a lot not said.  

The shareprice had a pump and dump from 2013 through 2014. Then the big money left it and it's been a decline ever since, with the odd spike. It's at it's lowest price point now. It probably had the crap diluted out of it's shares trying to scrap money and I bet the executives are getting paid a tidy sum with all that money.  

It happens a lot, A LOT for small cap companies. You can even follow execs from one company to another sometimes and watch the same pattern repeat. Eventually those executives get noticed and people stop investing big $'s when they see they are on the board. At which point their career is over and they are millions $ richer.  
I'm not saying that is happening here, however it has had the classic Pump and Dump that is rife in small caps.  

Oh, another example of not saying something, or obfuscating the truth (not lying) was this line:  
&gt;both the primary measure of the trial as well as multiple secondary measures yielded consistent, favorable trends, **in some cases reaching statistical significance** which were adversely affected by a high and unusual placebo response and a large degree of response variability.   

So in most cases it didn't show significance.  
There *might* be a trend and mayybbee if you add many more people and find a more precise method of measurement you *might* get a statistically significant result.  

Another one:  
&gt;aligned with drug responses reported for other approved agents participating in adult ADHD Phase III trials.  

Many drugs don't make it past phase III. Taken from a Forbes article:  
&gt;And, of course, add to all that the entirely avoidable, but nonetheless remarkably prevalent, tendency to progress agents into Phase 3 that did not actually achieve positive Phase 2 findings **(at least without the help of unjustifiable post hoc analyses).**  

However, The post Hoc analysis of this trial seems to have merit for their exclusions. Also this Phase III trial isn't exactly large. Only 150 people given the drug vs 150 placebo.  

Basically what it comes down to is this drug simply doesn't have the robust results expected from a drug that works, particularity when compared to other available medications. There is *chance* it does, however the Phase 2 and Phase 3 results aren't encouraging.  
Compare the results of this Phase III to those that actually made it to the market: Atomoxetine, Guanfacine, Clonidine. Also compare it to the big guns: amphetamine and methylphenidate.  

So yeah if I was a betting man, I'd put money on this drug not making it to the market, not without questionable results anyway.


Oh, I'm not saying this drug isn't useful, I am saying there is little evidence to show it is useful for treating ADHD.  

Here is the non-peer reviewed results of the study:

I've yet to see a peer reviewed article on it and it has been over year since results where completed. That isn't encouraging either.

I am a creature of habit, so I generally do like to go to the one pharmacy, but since this particular pharmacy regularly is out of stock of my meds, I've been put off somewhat.

Also, I have two kids, and my son has ADHD of the 'driven by a motor' variety, so convenience has become paramount in my life. If I'm doing my shopping in one area, I'll organise to get several scripts filled at the nearby pharmacy, and do the same based on wherever I happen to be on a given day, at a given time. 

I also have learned to organise my essential public outings at times when I don't have both my kids with me, ideally, or just one with me, slightly less ideally. Only in dire emergencies would I attempt to drag both kids out with me at the same time, which might sound ridiculous to other parents, but I am beleaguered.

If it looks like I'm hopping around madly from pharmacy to pharmacy to get my scripts filled, it's because I am! Sometimes, I simply can't spare the time, or effort to return on another day to collect an out of stock medication. I just need to take my script with me and try elsewhere when I can. I'm never rude about it, though, nor do I expect 'special' treatment to get my script filled faster, or before more urgent scripts for other people.

Then years later they discover there is a more direct, less taxing route to get places, but the old way is so familiar it feels safer despite its flaws. They now have to re-learn how to get everywhere they need to go using the interstate instead of the backroads. It requires reseting their whole way of functioning after long term habits have already been built.

This is of course once/if youre taking it regularly. I couldnt function, i could barely walk - the room was spinning, i had insomnia, paranoia, anxiety, depression, heart palpitations -you name it. Lucky i didnt have seizures because thats a real possibility.

Would you take me to the doctor, and then 'let' me take the meds that the doctor recommends and prescribes for my condition? Or would you say it's made up and he doesnt know what hes talking about and refuse to let me take the meds?"" I find sometimes a gentle approach that makes them question their thought process but in a nice way often helps.

"8264","Neurologists and independent psychiatrists can prescribe Ritalin too. Once you get your first monthly prescription a generalist can prescribe it each month for a year, then you’ll have to have another prescription from a specialist each year.

Adult Adhd is officially recognized by health services, as I said previously they wouldn’t reimburse it if it wasn’t the case, and it wouldn’t be acknowledged as an handicap if it wasn’t, but Ritalin is mostly used for children. You’re right about the fact that the Vidal and notices don’t address Adhd for adults, but that doesn’t mean anything except for practicians who doesn’t know shit anyway.

Atomoxetine is strattera. It’s another form of treatment which isn’t a stimulant. To be able to access to it your psychiatrist has to ask a special authorization to health services as there are no authorization yet for this drug in France. And for strattera I have to go to the CHU internal drugstore.

To be precise I was first on concerta which wasn’t so great, big crashes and anxiety. Then I was put on Ritalin LP and LI which was great except I felt high all the time. Now I’m on medikinet which is a modified liberation form of methylphenidate and it’s much much better, no highs nor crashes. A very subtle yet effective stimulation I think you should talk about it to your psychiatrist.

Last, adhd is surely not known well enough in  France yet, but the professionals I spoke to all agree on that first but also on the fact that it should not become as easily diagnosed as it is in USA neither.  ","e0zmihu",1,1529503707,"2018-06-20 14:08:27"

 Have a place for everything. And a lost and found box if things that has no place yet. Go through it every weekend. 

As far as cleaning, do little things. For example, you are in the bathroom. Wipe the counter really quick before you leave. Vacuum every weekend.

And about setting things on fire. It can happen. Some people put decorations or spices around their stove. We don't. 

If you are cooking something with oil, keep the lid close. Never ever pour water over it. Just put the lid over it.

Buy a few fire extinguishers for the kitchen. Put them in convenient places. Set your timer on your phone, for any task. Even if it's just boiling water. 

And last thing is, have a checklist on your front door. Things like, check the stove, check the window etc.   In a month you will get the habit. Or in our case two months.

We make a list and work our way through it together.

What I'm saying is you'll know when someone is compatible. If you are both messy ADDults who care for each other and help each other out, it will work. If the other person doesn't have ADHD and doesn't believe in ADHD, it probably won't work. There's more to people than their diagnosis.

However, I encourage you to look into other disorders too. Most people with ADHD have at least one other problem. Anxiety and depression are SUPER common, and both of them can cause the same problem.

Low blood sugar is another ""duh, but really."" When I recently upped my meds, the low blood sugar symptoms imitated my ADHD symptoms. 

Likewise, it could be anemia, stress, anything hormonal (low testosterone, BC, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, perimenopause), and anything related to sleep and the circadian rhythm (SAD, insomnia, etc). Autoimmune diseases too.

No one wants to actually have a disorder, specially one without a cure like ADHD. While anxiety, and depression may present the same problems that you have had with ADHD, they may be treatable completely. But, ADHD is a neurogenetic disorder, which means if you have kids you they may have ADHD and there is no real cure for it, only coping.

Now I hope you see where I am getting at. The important thing is to find out what is going on with you, and a psychiatrist is a medical professional that does that. This person will not laugh at your troubles, and will not say you are just lazy etc etc...They will try their best to see what is going on with you and improve your quality of live. Having ADHD or not does not mean you have completely control of your actions, regardless of how many times people have told you. There are so many things we don't know about the brain, and many people lose the genetic lottery. The psychiatrist will certainly look for answers with you rather than blame you for things you can't control.

You probably do not want to be diagnosed with a something like ADHD in the case that you don't actually have it since the drugs or treatment provided for ADHD may make whatever you are going through much worser. So why would you? No one wants to have a disorder, even if makes us accepting ourselves easier.

Instead of cleaning I ended up downloading some random drawing app that you can trace pics from your phone onto a piece of paper. Albeit cool, I have no actual desire to draw or sketch. I don’t even know what lead me to find it. Medicine certainly didn’t help get me on track and I’m constantly worried it isn’t working anymore or that I need a different type or dose. It’s scary. 

Your post really spoke to me. I hate having to ask people to repeat themselves or watching the tv and rewinding constantly or using closed captioning so I can read and hear and hopefully let things sink in. I’m tired of mentally and physically dropping things too. I really feel for you. And it’s so easy to be down on myself because I really feel stupid too. Forgetful and unmotivated to do things I need to. That slow hazy feeling that I get when I’m really trying to convince myself I understand what’s going on. The constant talking to myself in my head or coaching myself through mundane things because somehow I still forget to do all the steps. 

I think I understand you. It feels like I do. Or that you understand me. Reading your post mixed me up feeling sad that you go through this but comforted at the same time. There are understanding people out there. Just a bit harder to find because we must come off a little self centered and like we don’t care even though we can deeply care.

 ""You're welcome, you assholes""

For instance, I unknowingly out competed a friend for a girl in high-school, he felt bad about it, i didn't really know he was into her. Probably one of the most attractive girls in my senior class. My friend went off to college, while I stayed in town and moved in with this girl. My friend became the CEO of a big company at 28, and now he basically parties and travels for a living. While I wound up being emotionally abused by her for years, which turned me to alchohol, and wasted years of my life in a fit of serious depression. I always think, ya know, i'm glad I took the hit for him, if I hadn't he would have never wound up being rich.

I've been able to reign in my spending, focus more at work, been less likely to get irritated over little things because I couldn't stop hyperfocusing, and my mood swings have mellowed out considerably.

"8322","AFAIK, it doesn't work like that. It works like an anti-depressant, it has to build up in your system to start being effective and you have to take it everyday. This is something you should be discussing with your doctor.

I will add that, with ADHD medication, the goal if to find the effective dose where you have the least side effects (or manageable side effects) for the most desired effects.

You need to talk to your doctor. It's possible that they'll tell you that 50mg seems to be the right dose for you. It's also possible that you'll both agree that you could benefit from 75mg as you have more positive effects and that the dry mouth can be managed.

Texas has had more PAs from people on medicade than any other state for Zenzedi which is why it might be more expensive. To me, it's worth the price. 3 10mg tabs are not the same as 1 30mg brand tab.

"8328","&gt;You are 100% right. I'm frantic to 'fix' and not laying foundations.

So completely normal. :) A lot of parents do this when their kid starts to misbehave -- and then because they're exhausted and at their limits, when their kid finally relaxes and leaves them alone for a bit, they take a breather, and their kid learns that being good means getting ignored. Ignored &lt; getting yelled at, so they act out more, and it becomes a vicious cycle.

One thing you can start right now is just catching him behaving well. ANYTHING. The time he was quiet for the first 10 seconds in the grocery store. The second he picks up his fork and takes a bite of food without first playing with it. The time he waits 5 seconds without interrupting you when you tell him you're on the phone and to wait a bit. The rare time you tell him no to something he wants, and he reacts within appropriate limits. 

Seize on those *immediately* and make him feel like a loved and cherished superstar when they happen. It will help you get back to noticing all the greatness in him (which you are probably understandably losing sight of in the face of all the stress and desire for him to be doing okay), and it may help his behavior a bit. It may begin to feel like throwing him a parade just for not being a complete wreck, but if he can reliably get positive attention for doing the right thing, and the right thing is not excruciatingly painful or impossible, it will help him to start moving in the direction of doing the right thing. It won't be magic (and he'll still need treatment), but it can help! Punishments and negative consequences only tell a child what *not* to do -- praise and rewards tell the child what they *should* do, and they help build and nourish that loving bond.

No doubt you love your child. This kind of negative cycle happens for many wonderful parents who have gotten overwhelmed, or who are dealing with a child who has behavioral issues, or more will and energy than a previous child, etc. I'm glad my response was helpful! :) There are things that you might do differently in the future -- especially with the CBT, which I'm glad to hear targets parenting. Think of it as doing better, not having ""done wrong."" You did your best, you love your child, and you're not giving up. Doesn't mean you can stop learning to do better (that's a part of love and not giving up!), but no one could ask for more. ","d33r809",1,1463122017,"2016-05-13 06:46:57"

I got the Anki app and every time I learn something new, I write it down as a flash card. The app makes sure cards keep coming back on a schedule,  and all I have to do is check it once a day to keep things from getting lost. That way even if I take a break/get bored/am too busy to practice making anything at least I don't forget the basics.

I cannot stress enough though about getting a sleep study done and looking into melatonin to help you set a sleep schedule *that you stick to*. 

That really helped me out, and discovering I have sleep apnea which is why I was always so damn tired and lethargic. 

I don't know of any other advice to offer because I'm so damn critical of myself for the same type of thing. My biggest issue right now is I'm constantly finishing work an hour later than everyone else (closing a kitchen as a food service assistant) and I just can't do better at it, even though I used to. 

So, as much as I'm doing the same thing being mad at myself, I think we have to try and be kinder, and also ask for help from others. For example, I have a meeting with my boss to ask if I'm doing things differently to others (or actually fucking cleaning everything properly), so maybe you could ask someone around you to help hold you accountable? Maybe set phone reminders, or those browser things that block sites when you tell them to, etc? 

The way I see it, we can't just be like everyone else, so we gotta find ways that help us work in a similar way. Even though it sucks, and it's more work, and no one else seems to understand.

"8343","I never admire the improvement, because it's never good enough, honestly. Part of the issue is that my parents were neat freaks-I was raised in a house that was insanely clean, even with multiple pets. So I can't measure up to that standard. (I suspect my father has an undiagnosed OCD, actually. This is not a blame game. I think they did the best they could, I am just very different from them.)

Also, many of the issues you noted ARE NOT PROBLEMS FOR ME. Dishes? Always washed. Dirty clothes? 90% of the time they're corralled. My place is oddly clean, but disorganized. My brother, last time he was here, came over to bail me out when I was freaking out about living in a hovel. His comment was ""whoa, I was expecting filth. you have stuff everywhere, and have somehow managed to clean around, under and through it. it's cluttered and disheveled. it's not filthy at all!""

I need a task master, as it turned out, to get me through what the real issue is-the organization. turns out I'm pretty good at cleaning, because I don't like dirty things. when I have anyone else with me, directing traffic, the things all get put away.

"8344","Where I come from - people don't even believe that ADHD is a real thing. When I first started school, the first grade was hell for me. I never learned anything new, because I already knew how to read, I was able to do basic matemathical tasks and my knowledge was wide for a first grader. However, I was always 'slow' because so many things kept distracting me and I never could finish the tesr, dictations, etc on time. My mother used to sit with me, every afternoon after school and did homework with me. I really suffered. Then, trough the school years I somehow managed to still get good grades, mainly As and Bs. 

Then I entered nursing high school and I bullshited my way trough theory, because I have a way with words, I do read a lot and I still maintain a variety of interests. I still wasn't doing homework and in the last year I missed a lot of classes because we had teacher that I just couldn't stand listening to. Imagine trying to keep focus while your teacher is seated infront of the class, going: 'Mitochooooondriiiaa is the pooooowerhouuuuse of the ceeeell', with a nasal voice. It's freaky and it could be used as a troture method on me. 

I finished high school, with Bs and then went to nursing faculty. I was in hell. The only thing keeping me from getting negative grades was still my interest in many things, and a good relationship with some teacher.

Once, when I started getting panic attacks because I felt like I was a total faliure and the schoolwork just kept piling up and wasn't going nowhere, that's when I was finally diagnosed. But unfortunately, the psychiatrist that diagnosed me had me in the office for the duration of one session, perscribed me Strattera, told me to take it twice a day (just go with 80mg straight from the begginign) and I can visit his support groups once a day. That was it. 

Strattera is still, after two years, neatly packed and I'm terrified of taking it, his support grups were extremely unhelpfull.

The only way I managed to turn my ADD into a gift was multitasking at work. But everyday I-m terrified that I will forget something important or make a vital mistake or something.

"8370","First and foremost, I don't know your boyfriend. You do. I don't know if this is new behavior, or something that has been glossed over through rose colored glasses from the beginning of the relationship or not. So my opinions may be off. I guess it's up to you to figure it out! :D

First of all, ADHD is not an excuse. It should never be an excuse. It's certainly a consideration, but given the fact that he has known about his ADHD since kindergarten and (apparently) fails to have learned to have dealt with it or implement strategies to help diminish it is completely on him. If he misses appointments constantly, or if he forgets plans made by you constantly, then that is his fault. As you mentioned Snapchat, I can only assume he has a phone. There are a number of scheduling/notification apps that can be used to remind people of upcoming obligations or dates. Using ADHD as an excuse either by him, or you, is unacceptable. He's an adult with a mental illness. That mental illness, albeit difficult, can be and is managed by most everyone who has it.

He seems (to me), to be an asshole. ADHD doesn't make you apathetic towards other people which he seems to be doing. If he was truly sorry he would work with you to come to an agreement or a strategy to ensure that both parties of the relationship are happy. For example, when my wife would go and rock our 8 month old daughter to sleep, I would take this time to go on the laptop, play video games, or whatever it is unhinged ADHD folk do when given the option. I would completely forget about the tidying, dish washing, organizing that I could do that's somewhat necessary on a daily basis when you have an 8 month old. This drove my wife nuts. Seeing that it was important, I apologized and wanted to come up with a strategy to help me remember to help her. So I drafted a checklist of things I could do while little one is falling asleep, printed off a number of them on index card sized sheets, and hung them on the baby's room door. When I help her get settled to rock, I take one before I leave the room and run down the list every night.

Now my strategy may not work for you, but if he truly was sorry, I can't imagine sitting down with him, developing a weekly schedule, and setting up reminders to keep him on point.

Maybe I am overly harsh. Maybe I'm not. I guess only you really know for sure. At the end of the day you have to consider what makes you happy. If the positives of the relationship outweight the negatives, then stick with it and see if he is willing to work with you and himself. If not, you have to heavily consider your options. If he has always acted this way, and despite you absolutely saint-like patience nothing has changed, you have to consider if this is a relationship you wish to maintain and continue on into the future.

I truly hope things work out for you!

**TL:DR** Developing strategies to deal with ADHD is not impossible. He can just like most everyone else has. It's up to you to determine if this is a struggle worth fighting. Having ADHD is not synonymous with being an asshole.","cze75x5",7,1453923428,"2016-01-27 19:37:08"

"8383","Don't worry about Day 1 - Day 1 is a total write off.  Your body is not used to the medication and whatever you experience on Day 1 - whether it is euphoria, or a 2 hour high, or nothing at all - will not last.

On my first day, I felt nothing for 4 hours, then had a huge surge of euphoria for 45 minutes, then crashed.  Your body needs time to adjust, and everyone's biochemistry is different.

On the plus side, it's obviously working on some level due to the side effects you mentioned.  Plus, the fact that you have decided to write your own post, even though it might not seem euphoric, is evidence of the drug working.

One huge tip I will offer than helped me is that, yes, Vyvanse does provide a huge amount of clarity and organizational help, but it doesn't always give you that BOOST to get you going.  It doesn't really provide the motivation/euphoria.  It does sometimes early on, but it just goes away in a few days as your body gets used to it.

So, my advice is: start doing whatever it is you should be doing in a typical work day, and let the Vyvanse work its magic. I've sat around many an afternoon waiting for the kick that never came - meanwhile, searching hte internet and posting and organizing shit that doesn't really have any value.

I read a report that they aren't tooled to place university graduates into jobs and they don't ever seem to know much.

My resume and linkedin is well put together.  
It's my lack of professional experience, shorts job tenure, and useless degree that is holding me back.  I need an entry level training role in a new field unrelated to my job experience (if you can even call it that,)

Actually my job progress is more of a regression moving down from IT project management to account management to foodservice coordination to part time bartender.  I've straight up been told its backwards and doesn't tell a compelling narrstive.  Like fuck me I've stuggle to find, get and retain a job let alone a suitable career.  Let alone find a good fit that I can handle and excel it.  I made the mistake of not understand the labour market and my apptitude, but I was stressed out, high all the time and basically homeless/dealing with unstable living conditions prior to university during to persistent fighting with my family.

I've always had difficulty socializing in big groups and their dybamics (summer camp, high school) , and crowds overwhelm me and I can't handle an inconsistent schedule...on top of I'm just not interested in being friendly or dealing with emotional labour for my job (I've got a less than average EQ)

  Doesn't help that every single position in Toronto is competitive, from retail, to labour to working as a lawyer, accountant, or even entry level tech sales (actually that's hyper competitiors).  It's too complex of a labour market and there is always a better experiences, more relevant candidate that is much happier to be there.

Just because 1 doctor says she thinks I'm fine (after talking to me and asking my family history and all that for an hour and a half IN TOTAL mind you) doesn't mean that I'm just flippantly stubborn about what I think is going on in my head.

So the thought of a stimulant in my body should have made me say ""Oh wait but...maybe not?"" But that didn't happen cause I just want to be able to function like a normal human being.

I have no problem with being called out, and I like having the discussion. And now that I think about it, I would say that yeah, I'm entitled, just like everyone else here. I'm entitled to get the help that I need and find someone that can do that with me. And that doctor really didn't. I'm envious of the people that get a good doctor right off the bat, cause I never have been able to do that. Why should my own concerns be glossed over and dismissed because someone who knows nothing about me and how I am outside of their office says I'm wrong? If I meet someone and they tell me their problems, I can't imagine just being like ""No, it's all in your head and you're really just okay. You seem fine to me so clearly there's nothing wrong.""

"8390","I’m not 100% ADHD but I definitely have *something* no right with my brain. We’re trying to figure it out, but my doc thinks it could be bipolar, anxiety/depression, or ADHD. Or... trauma from emotional abuse and instability in my childhood (yay!). 

I personally don’t think it’s JUST the trauma (as he seems to lean that way). I’m just too energetic sometimes and too down sometimes for it to be solely based on that. So IDK! But just wanted to share my multiple “could be” diagnoses. Brains are hard, people are complex. Sucks ADHD meds made me an emotional wreck. ","e1ry6e1",2,1530709981,"2018-07-04 13:13:01"

One has very strong ASPD traits, the other definitely has ADHD.  The ADHDer cheated on the ASPDer before they could emotionally withdraw first.  

Point is, it's not they're bad friends.  I just literally can't feel the emotions of others.  Fortunately, meds helps a ton with this, so I can tell how people are feeling and appreciate when others enjoy my presence.  I just wish my childhood hadn't done so much damage.

[How to Become a Straight A Student by Cal Newport](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0767922719/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1451871911&amp;sr=8-1&amp;pi=SY200_QL40&amp;keywords=cal+newport+how+to+become+a+straight-a+student&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=41Px1we-UDL&amp;ref=plSrch) This book defines the genre of what an effective student guide really is.

I still notice a ""high"" feeling when I start taking Vyvanse after a break, but it's less of a ""jacked up"" feeling (like Adderall) and more of an intense alert and focused feeling. It should fade after a few days to a week. I also notice that the come-down from Vyvanse is less of a crash and more of a fade.  

I split my dose using the water titration method (http://adhdboss.com/vyvanse-dosage-hack/) since the evening fade was affecting my ability to get to bed at an early hour, so I take 30 mg in the morning and an additional 10 mg in the afternoon, which allows for a little bit of overlap during the busiest part of my day.

"8405","Exactly. It’s not a pure poison, it’s even found in eggplants in a very small amount, but if you want to use it to help you focus, you usually need a larger amount, which is not worth it imho. Usually people with ADHD self-medicate with cigarettes not knowing they have ADHD. It was one of the clues for my (very late) diagnosis. What happens is that, one the one hand nicotine does help you focus, but probably not as much as the ritual of smoking. So patches and gums can be temporary options if you’re trying to quit, but I doubt that nicotine alone is worth the trouble. Especially keeping in mind that you screw your nicotine receptors up by consuming nicotine in any form, so you need to increase your dosages all the time.","ewc4uhq",1,1565278096,"2019-08-08 15:28:16"

I look forward to lunch because I can stretch, get some non-screen time and fresh air.

-Put off seeking treatment pretty much for the reasons you described/no health coverage
-Found an affordable doctor in my area due to a physical health problem
-During my yearly checkup I mentioned behavioral problems and asked for a referral to a therapist, luckily one works in house
-Started seeing therapist every month/every other week or so for the past 6 months....just now learning how to be my own advocate and lead conversations....it takes practice as I had never done therapy before. She helps me with anxiety and such and recommended me the book ""Scattered"" by Gabor Mate which led me to believe beyond doubt that I have adhd.
-Mentioned medication to my therapist. She can ask my doctor to prescribe but she focuses more on holistic treatment and I don't think she is comfortable with it and I didn't want to push it
-Gave my therapist a printed out list of the issues that effect me in my daily life, since we mostly talk about my past trauma and I tend to leave things out due to embarrassment/forgetfulness
-Researched psychiatrists in my area who specialize in adult ADHD.
-Called specialists, asked for prices, determined which one I wanted to see and kept contact info for a backup.
-Asked my therapist for a referral to the psych, will be making an appointment with the psych when I turn in a records release form and return from a trip in May.
-???

This has been a many years long process for me, but it gets SO much easier and more validating when you have people/professionals backing you up. I have noticed that my mood/sense of dread and low self worth has let up quite a bit once I got the ball rolling.

“Medication is only a last resort.”
“The goal is to grow out of your ADHD.”

By 6 he’s already being treated differently by his teachers and the other kids are aware he’s not able to some things the rest of the kids can do.

The problem with the “last resort” philosophy is that you end up with a sweet little boy who has lost his swagger, which is a vital asset throughout life.”

And he will be a failure because you set it up that the tool that helps 80% of the people who take it, is only for the losers. 

The problem with “outgrowing their ADHD” is that you set them up for another failure.  They aren’t grown unless they disavow themselves from the skills and tools that help them live a full life.

"8457","That's a super great analogy. I'm also working on my phd, I'm also in the writing stage :/ I was recently diagnosed i.e. last week. My entire grad school experience now makes a little more sense. I've tried ""resetting"" numerous times and while it gives me a healthier outlook on life, it takes me a LONG time to get back into things. I'd say today and tomorrow before you let yourself loose and off the hook, to map out the first few hours or days of your time next week. I try to do this and when I do it helps remind me where I left off. 
Also, I frequently felt guilty when I took days or weekends off in grad school and it made me feel worse and less motivated. Recently I realized that I'd rather be happy and relaxed on my time off then thinking I should be doing my introduction or background research etc. So whatever you do enjoy your time off!

"8471","One of the problems with add/adhd is a blind spot when it comes to consequences.  
If someone were to ask me what would happen if... i would be able to answer, but just doing these actions?...the end results never come to mind.
 And its odd really... so odd that i cannot give a reason as to why i did a certain thing because of course i knew what would happen... i just didnt think of it and if I did, it was momentary and I didn't care....y not? Dunno...it's frustrating and often a cause of anger on my part. practical linear thinking is not the forte of add/adhd.
Anywho, the reason that I'm telling you this twofold. 
1. Procrastination to the point of self sabotaging is not only normal but expected, even if the person is medicating, just because the end result is not real to them, either from lack of thought or lack of fucks given. 
2. Extrapolating this further...until the absolute worst conclusion/consequence is reached, nothing will change (this part is mitigated by medication and possibly by other character traits)
I had to end up in a shelter as an absolutely horrible person just because I was apathetic to the consequences of my actions because I simply didn't think of them and if I did...I didn't care. 
HOWEVER! I never at any point wanted to hurt anyone, I loved my so(s). I just wasn't real to me what I was doing. 
I'm sorry you're going through this...I honestly believe that if he won't get medical help, he needs to be at the bottom before he will change. Just please remember, he truly loves and appreciates you...he just can't see what he's doing. Telling him is not enough, showing him is not enough...he needs to experience it for it to be real to him (explain red to a blind man). For his sake insist he gets help or kick him out! Nothing good will develop until he changes. Sorry for the wall of text.

Do some research on daily coping tips, organization, and sort of life-coachy stuff so you learn what works for you and what doesn't. I feel like living with ADHD is living in a trial/error format. I never got diagnosed until my first desk job, probably at the age of 25. Suddenly my school years made so much more sense to me - I always struggled with ADHD but because I was a straight A student (who never had to study)  everyone attributed my disruptive behavior in the classroom to me being a social butterfly. I did struggle with college but never gave it a thought, I contributed everything solely to my tendency to procrastinate. 

Personally, I know for sure I can't really handle desk work without medication (I had to go a year without meds due to insurance problems, that was a struggle), and I'm constantly tweaking my time management with a synced work/life calendar, bullet journaling (I found the bujo style works for me in a planner format better than in a notebook where I tend to either get wayyyyy off track or get hung up on being perfect) &amp; I need to look more into time-blocking, I'm starting to think that will help me in my new position a bunch. 

Also, I felt compelled to reply bc you seem like you very much want the position you were fired from and you mentioned ""negative self concept"".

I would be all over the place, it stimulated me almost. I wanted to draw and talk and do chores and homework. I knew there had to be something wrong there because other drugs didn't give me opposite effects like opiates did. 

I think you'll do perfectly fine. You're getting help and seeing a doctor and seem motivated to kick the habit. If you feel your meds aren't working or you're feeling urges to use again, please see another doctor. Preferably one that doesn't just specialize in recovering addicts (sometimes you may be denied medication you really need because of this) so you can get the meds you need.

- 5/10 min recap of everything you learnt on that day before you go to bed and when u wake up the next day - honestly it sticks in!!

- have a whiteboard in handy, explain something you've learnt, draw it out and pretend you're teaching it to someone

- question bank notes - i fold A4 paper/ notebook sheets in half verically and basically all my notes are in Q and A form. Qs on the left and As on the right so when i flick through and wanna test myself i look on the left. Really good for things u always seem to forget or things u need to learn word for word

- summary mindmaps - good for recall. Before i begin to relearn everything i do a mindmap of things i already think i know about it. Then after ive done notes on iyt, i do that again to see how much i can remember

- havent tried this but looking for apps that will set me timers for 40 mins study alarms then 10 min break alarms to help me manage my time better as i sometimes spend 10 mins studying or 3 hrs and forget to eat/ drink.

"8525","You're not wrong. But you're not completely right either.
Most strategies that help someone with Adhd work for someone without.
Most coping strategies for any mental illness can help neurotypicals. 
And I'd strongly disagree that most psychotypical( never heard that one before, btw) have problems that make it just as hard. Because if that was the case, they probably wouldn't be neurotypical. 

The big difference between me and the people without Adhd that went to school with me or that study with me right now, is that they at some point just managed to pull themselves out of the dirt. They started learning regularly, got good sleep schedules, stopped with the drugs and alcohol. I was shocked, because I thought they had the same problems like me, but since I wasn't diagnosed since last year I always just thought it was my fault for not trying hard enough. I couldn't. I knew what I had to do and tried so hard. Most of the time that meant I was at least doing something. But I just couldn't. My past failures are not solely because of Adhd, but there would have been a  lot less without it. And really, we can't say which struggles we would still have, or how they would affect us.

We seem to have different life experiences here and I agree that it isn't easy for anyone. I'd interpret it more like you already have the biggest struggle behind you. We have to work hard on us, just to be able to function like a normal person. That's harder than finding out what you want to do with your life. We know ourselves much better because we are forced to. We know our boundaries, our strength and weaknesses because we are forced to confront, exploit and work with those every day in a way they don't have to. In a way we can't afford many of those struggles they may face, because we already have to fight so many they don't even realize someone could have.

Invalidating anyones struggles, neurotypical or not,is not the goal of this comment. We have the tenavity because we struggled our whole life. For us it's just one of many hurdles, for them it's one of few. But they are still obstacles to overcome and everyone deserves the help they need to do so.

She is talented but doesn’t reach her potential. 
She could be a great student but becomes distracted often, and distracts those around her. 

And so on Hahahaha like ffs really?? No one thought that after 12+ years of me ‘not reaching my ‘potential’’ despite the amount of work I tried to do that there wasnt something wrong????
And I literally always complained about how I tried so hard at school and spent so much more time doing my work and putting in loads of efffort than pretty much everyone else in my classes, yet they still did better than me.
Like I was told I could be smarter if I wasn’t distracted or disorganised, and I constantly complained of doing worse than everyone else despite putting in more effort (since I was supposedly a potentially great student this would suggest that my bad results are not just a result of me being not smart). What’s more I understood the concepts most of the time but still did shit.

My psychiatrist (a black woman) sent me to school with a time on task, which I did with a teacher's aide pretty soon after. And then I got diagnosed.

Re: ADHD Superpowers

I am always terrified when I have to speak in front of other people, whether it be speaking to a small group, speaking to the public, or juat speaking one on one in an interview. That fear also allows me to hyperfocus when preparing for whatever thing I need to speak for.
Like you, I also feel as if I will ""vomit on stage"" before the event takes place, always up until it's time to start.
And then when it's time, something clicks and that hyperfocus comes back, but this time the focus is on the speaking and I'm no longer nervous. I'm suddenly confident, my thoughts are well put together and I can actually articulate them.
Once it's finished, back to the same nervous person I was before. 
It's crazy. If you speak to me outside of that hyperfocus, it's like speaking to a different person.

Rely less on medication. You don't need some fucking pills to function. They help, some help, but reliance will cripple you. Fight it. I know that's not popular advice here, but clearly what you're doing right now isn't working.

Find your true motivation to do something. Go into self employment if you need to. Working for someone else isn't the only way to be successful and make money.

Do whatever the fuck you feel like doing, and make it into a career.

You don't need a motivational pep talk. You just need to find something you're good at, and just do whatever you love. Probably the thing that got you two masters.

Don't be afraid of meds ""turning you into a zombie"", if you end up going down that route. That usually won't happen on an appropriate dose (taking too much can damp down the limbic system too much). The stimulants in particular are easy to stop or change if you don't like them, and you don't need to wait a month to figure out if you're responding or not, provided you hit an adequate dose.

My poor husband has been so patient through it all (he’s undiagnosed, but I’m fairly certain he’s ADHD as well). He’s been forced to tolerate my huge need for plenty of personal space and time to myself, time that I use to organize, plan, get shit done.

He and I grew up in different countries and I’m living in his country (Taiwan) now. So there’s quite a different approach to mental health in our respective native lands. In Asia it’s still very much a stigmatized topic, and although ADHD has started to become acknowledged, it’s seen as a “children’s disorder” and isn’t usually treated in adults.

Thus, I’ve been forced to develop coping mechanisms! And more recently, I’ve decided to shell out major dough for online therapy since I can’t get the right kind of therapist here.

I didn't fall for the ""let's be friends"" or ""still hang out"" nonsense the other letdowns threw at me, but this current deal I am in is more difficult because the guy is not a total dick.

In your situation, yes guys can be retarded in that way. Same deal happened to me. Its like when you cut them off, they suddenly know what they missed out on and try to be all nice to remove them of the guilt that catches up to them.

"8666","Howdy,

I've been reading Boost: Create Good Habits Using Psychology and Technology by Max Ogles.

I got the ebook on Amazon.ca for CDN $3.36 and it's probably even cheaper on Amazon.com. 

I have found it to be excellent; a rare self-help book that seems totally compatible with ADHD. It's short, relevant, and at the end of every chapter has a summary of key points as well as advice on how to implement the strategies.

It talks (among other things) about incentivising good habits, disincentivising bad habits, and includes links to lists of helpful apps that you can use in conjunction with the strategies being described.

Anyway, for $3, how can you go wrong?

"8669","I have the opposite problem: I am almost always relaxed and way too relaxed. 

My best friend had taken some relaxation herbal medicine recently, and told me that he feels like he can sit there and enjoy the scenery for an hour. Without feeling like he needs to get up and go do stuff. That he'd be content to enjoy a small snack without over thinking calories or money or if he should get up and get way more snacks. Just chill; if there's more snacks, cool, if not, also cool. He feels like he's not constantly thinking back on today and what this person said or the way that person looked at him etc. He's not planning the next day and being anxious about who he needs to talk to and how it will all go and what if and how then and what now. 

Meanwhile I'm looking at him, going, shit man, that's just how I normally am. :/ Herbal medicine was a complete waste of money for me, on the other hand. Apparently I'm already chilled. Too chill: ""I can take it or leave it really doesn't matter to me"" gets taken to the other extreme. Like how in Serenity folks just laid down and stopped eating and breathing. Almost.

"8671","I can relate to SO MANY of the comments here. I don't think of myself as a klutz, but I walk in to or bump things all the time. Like, I know the door is there, but I'll still walk in to the door jamb or doorknob, a chair, my cats (sorry, buds), anything really. When I was a kid my mom would say that a piece of furniture came out to bite me - not sure if that's a common phrase, but it was because I always had bruises or cuts from walking in to everything. 

I know it's there, and I see it, but it's not until I am in the process of bumping in to it that my brain is like ""oh, move two inches to the right"" and by then it's too late. I am also the classic example of asking where my phone is when it's right in my hand. If I'm ever out somewhere, like a restaurant (I've forgotten what those are like in these COVID days), and I ask where the bathroom is, there inevitably is a giant neon blinking sign pointing to it.

I am seeing my doctor tomorrow morning about it, and hoping that she gives me a referral to an understanding psychiatrist, or at least one that I can visit as soon as possible.
I'm planning to take in my uni work to show that its not my lack of will or laziness, as the amount of my effort I put into my work is ridiculous, but its the only way that helps me to remember even some stuff.

In school I've gotten grief for getting into arguments with this other person, who has more influence (so to speak). I think I was right most of the time, and it was very frustrating to be the one who was reneged. Then a friend cleared things up for me, saying ""If you have an argument with a crazy person, people are gonna assume you're equally crazy"". 

So yeah, it's like you said where people laugh it off. Odds are, in that particular situation, you'd have been better off just laughing about it. Just don't go down to their level.

For the situation that happened, there's not much you can do. You could apologize privately to the person for having made a joke at their expense, and leave it at that (don't try to argue if they get mad at you for bringing it up; just stick to ""I just wanted to apologize for that. I won't do it again""). You'll have a weight lifted off of you, the ball is now in their court, and there's nothing else you can do to change the past.

I read a study recently about how taking amphetamines doesn't actually boost performance in neurotypical people the same way as it does people with ADHD.  Like, they have more energy, they work faster, but they're not any better at focusing.  It's because it's not the stimulant part that helps, the drug compensates for differences in the ADHD brain, and if those differences aren't there, the drug doesn't do anything but hype you up.

I was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive type) last week and suddenly like half the struggles in my life just...make sense. I’m learning of the links between ADHD and obesity (lifelong weight problem - I only feel “full” when I’ve eaten to excess and am uncomfortable but otherwise don’t really notice the cues), sensitivity to sound (I cannot drown out irritating noises like people chewing, and it makes me crazy when someone talks when the TV is on because it feels like my head is inside a big bell; I cannot listen to podcasts because of the banter and noise and something about the sound quality), and forgetfulness to the point that it’s impacting my life (driving my partner crazy, and I actually threw away my extra pair of glasses recently!). 

My mom, who was a college professor and did academic research into ADHD, never spotted it in me as I was growing up because I was smart enough to do well in school. I’m almost 46.

I’m sure my story isn’t new here. My questions: 
—What resource(s) did you direct your family/partner to when they don’t really “get” it? Is there anything you can point someone to so the whole “I have ADHD” thing doesn’t sound like an excuse but is actually real? 
—What are people’s experiences with Ritalin v Adderal v Vyvanse?
—Because of the pandemic my plan is to get medicated now and then work with a coach later after I feel more in control; is this a good strategy or should I go the other way around? 
—What connections were you able to make in terms of life patterns after you got diagnosed? Anything earth shattering?
—What are the questions I should be asking?

-	I have to be completely hyper focused, usually over something stupid that’s frustrating me/stopping progress, and working for hours straight or...
-	... I have to stop working after only like an hour burst, because if I try to go longer I’ll “fade out”
-	I always pick the smaller, quicker, brainless tasks over the longer or more mentally-taxing ones (even if the latter pay more/are more important)
-	I always blamed my poor work amounts/ethic on random excuses, like my part time job, and my anxiety spiked really high when I first quit and only did at-home work because it still wasn’t happening despite me having no excuses left

I wish you luck, but I suggest you start smaller, maybe just with the substances or with the entertainment. Cutting out media and TV will leave you with a lot of extra time, in which you will most likely want to smoke ciggies even more so.

When doing so many things at once, it also makes it difficult for you to understand what is and what isn’t providing a benefit to you.

I would say that the majority of people have some sort medical issue. If standard medical issues were acceptable reasons to not be a functioning human being then we would all be screwed!

I do however think this is a great place to support each and help each other develop coping mechanisms. I have severe ADHD, take 20-25mg of adderall most days to help manage, and otherwise control my symptoms through habits. For example, I have a to do list system that helps motivate me, block distracting websites during hours I want to work, have specific work places where I am most productive. With the combination of medication and these lifestyle changes, I am working on my PhD at one of the best medical schools in the world. 

I think that many people use ADHD as a crutch. As someone who legitimately struggles to focus, I find it frustrating to read others who are using the disease to be lazy. I worked my butt off before I started taking adderall and still do. It am just more efficient now since I don't have to reread every sentence a million times to process it in my head. I agree that is it frustrating to hear people talk about how they are having trouble cleaning their rooms. I am messy and disorganized too but when my room gets nasty then I clean it... It isn't that big of a deal. There are plenty of us on here with severe ADHD who are determined to kick butt in this world.

We were walking and I just get really...lazy? That feeling where concentrating on anything is not even worth attempting, and someone could repeat something 20 times and you'd still ask for them to repeat. 

This pretty much happened in the middle of finding out more about each other, and our families. I ask about her dad, who had died in cancer (something I vaguely knew), and she quietly says that he died in cancer. I apparently said something like ""hmm"", and we kept walking. Couple of silent minutes later (I didn't realise there was anything awkward), uninterested ADHD me asks ""so what did you say your say your dad's name was?"". 

Subconsciously I realised what I had done, apologised, she wasn't that upset but she took offence in how uninterested I obviously was. We went on and then she made some excuse to go home and left. Relationship didn't last long at all since it perfectly matched my switching to the new Concerta doses that weren't cutting it.  Made me really dull and uninteresting, even though I'm usually displaying some of that hyperactivity (not too obnoxiously). 

So my recommendation; tell her that you have ADD and that you couldn't focus properly last night. Usually goes down pretty well if you DON'T say it in person.

RE: Amphet_88

Thanks to everyone for their responses and sorry about my belated response. Since my initial posting I definitely feel better but still feel exhausted after six (6) hours. I have no doubt that the half-life of Vyvanse may be up to twelve (12) hours, but it's efficacy beyond six (6) hours (for me at least) is arguable.
 

I must admit that I have mixed feelings about my switch as although I no longer feel the aforementioned anxiety that I experienced with Adderall, I don't enjoy having to plan my day around this awful crash, or whatever the h*ll it is that I'm experiencing. This is the only negative effect I've experienced with Vyvanse; no sleep disturbances, no increased anxiety or ""flight or flight"" response, no adrenaline issues, nothing...

Hopefully my doctor will prescribe a Vyvanse (or Dextro) booster to take in the afternoon before the crash so I can carry-on with the rest of the day. It doesn't seem that taking a higher dose in the morning would extend the efficacy for me, rather it seems to be a metabolic issue for myself; I wager that even at a dose of 100mg at 07:00am I would still crash six (6) hours later.

I've always metabolized amphetamines faster than most, including Adderall, so I'm confident in my assumption even given the unique mechanism of action with Vyvanse. 

I am nervous at the thought of mixing Adderall (XR or IR) with Vyvanse due to it's L-isomer content and the anxiety it gives me, so I believe I will just hold out another week and speak with my physician about adding a booster.

I don't believe the issue is dietary as I consume at least 2000 calories per day of healthy carbs and protein. I also exercise at least an hour per day, varying between cardio and weights.

Thanks again for all of your response. I will be sure update my progress as I think it's important for a record of my experience be kept for others who may experience this problem in the future.

It sucks that stimulants get abused by people who don’t have ADHD, since it makes the stigma that much worse for those of us who have to deal with the symptoms. 

However, personally I’ve found that caffeine works just as well as stimulants on days when I forget to take my prescription before class and don’t have time to run back and get it. Sipping a mocha with 2 espresso shots or chugging a Monster usually does the trick.

You mentioned her not knowing about your adhd and thinking she wouldn’t believe you because you’re successful in life.

You may be able to use that as a good example of how helpful proper medication and therapy can be.

Maybe you can bring up your situation if she ever mentions her son’s behavior around you.  That way it can be an organic segue instead of a planned confrontation.

She may be surprised to hear you are medicated etc.  You can tell her how you were once like him as a child, but with proper medication, support, therapy and hard work you’ve been able to become who you are today.  not a different person, just a more capable one.

You can explain how difficult normal everyday life is for people with adhd who are unmediated, and that it isn’t simply a matter of getting school work done, but being able to exist as an adult with significantly more responsibilities and consequences.

Not to say that would be an easy discussion to have with someone, but since he has had medication in the past it doesn’t sound like she is completely opposed to it.  She may simply not understand it, like much of the world.

"8829","It does make sense, don’t belittle your concerns.  Your worries are valid and you can address them all with a good doctor. I told my doc that I was worried to try stimulants because of all the stuff I had heard about them so we started with the non stimulants first. We did things responsibly. 

Addiction takes some time to accomplish and if you do end up addicted to anything prescribed then your doctor can help ween you off of it responsibly. But, there’s also a chance that you don’t become addicted. 

Also, ADD is usually accompanied by other mental illnesses. It’s not uncommon for someone to also have depression and anxiety, which would contribute to your eating issues. Don’t worry about being misdiagnosed, it could happen but you’ll know if the meds aren’t working and the treatment isn’t successful. 

My doc wants feedback, he wants to know how I’m doing and I can call him any time with questions. He even gave me a guideline for IF I start to feel like I’m developing an addiction. So, I guess my point is don’t be afraid to get treatment if you think you have ADD. You aren’t all alone taking your meds and feeling your way through the process, your doc should be there for every step and concern. 

Also, I can’t tell you how many times I felt like maybe I was just making it all up in my head. Even after I got diagnosed I still had those moments where I felt like a fraud.

"8835","I'm kind of the same way, I usually have a few favourites but they change around quite often.

For example, I have a few bands I've been listening to a lot lately, and a ton of bands I've been listening to often for a while. I usually have a few favourite songs from each band, but it completely depends on my mood, the situation, and mainly if I've been listening to something way too much over the past week or two and have gotten sick of it.

I had a favourite colour as a little kid but don't now, maybe a favourite 2 or 3 but I don't really think about that much.

Same with movies, I have a handful I really like and might rewatch 1 or 2 every several months.

When I was younger and really into video games I had a few that I played a lot and would cycle between hyperfocusing on one every week or two, or sometimes spend an hour on each one in a day.","f6g0mly",1,1572820372,"2019-11-03 22:32:52"

After they stopped working, I switched to a different brand. 

It’s nice to be off drugs. 

The one thing I’m trying to head off is the anger and irritability. On meds, now, If I’m working on something, say my car, and it’s not going good, I don’t get angry. But before my diagnosis I would get angry and take it out on my spouse by yelling at her for something stupid. If that comes back I would have to back on meds. I’m hoping as we get older the symptoms lessen. Our brains are changing so it’s a little harder to detect add vs old age changes. Try and document what you go through for future generations.

"8865","Well... I mean I guess they teeeechnically aren't wrong, but it's obvious they didn't get what you were communicating which is one of the most insufferable things to experience. I don't know how to offer advice (I also realize this is more of a venting post and advice probably isn't being requested but my Adderall just kicked in and I want to communicate things!) with that because I face this with my parents and to a lesser degree most friends. Even with a couple of my friends that have achieved an understanding of what it is I go through, I can't put it past them to forget about it when it comes to certain conversations that involve my dysfunction, because it's hard to even conceptualize for abled people, but they try and I appreciate them for that. You're not alone though, thankfully. I'd probably be insane if I didn't know other people go through the same thing.

You actually could take from their intent something to better yourself (please don't hate me for that I can totally understand the emotion that could invoke) if you can dissociate it from the folly of their misunderstanding of your situation. Despite the ability to go through with the decisions and continued effort to better your self through your actions in this material world, you can actively make attempts to frame your mindset to perceive it more as a series of problems to solve, and not fall into the trap of pessimistic thinking. They're separate things, and that's probably what the person you were talking to may have tried to communicate about, being the latter. Even if they're entirely ignorant of your struggle in doing actions, and may possibly never know what it's like and understand. 

With our kind, we have to learn an entirely separate skill set that people just learn intuitively. And even with that skillset, we can't make up for the ability to do a task we don't want to do, with the acknowledgement that it will benefit our future self, fueling our drive to finish said task, that anyone else can do if they just willed it. It's so easy to fail again and again and foster a negative outlook, or negative feelings towards yourself. 

I've been depressed and suicidal too many times to remember since the first time I flunked out of college, to the third time I flunked out and got fired. I have my excuses, anxiety and sleep deprivation exacerbated my procrastination and avoidance tendencies. I didn't do homework because I procrastinated until I was too tired, and what I didn't actively avoid, I simply forgot. I was always late because I miscalculated how long it'd take for me to get ready, I'd stay in bed to make up for my lack of sleep until the last possible moment, then get late enough to not go to class and to get fired.

It wasn't just one moment where I decided enough was enough and to turn my life around. In fact, there were fucking hundreds of those moments. Where I decided to start planning it out, to finally get serious and stop fucking around. I'd end up failing shortly after or have that failure delayed by a lucky streak. But the thing was, I was still alive after all that, and I hadn't exhausted all my options or my resources to keep going. I still had a support system, and I still had my capability to learn and try again and progress.

I know infinitely more now than I did a year ago. I know to avoid blue light at night, and what I'm most likely to not avoid when it comes to consistency so that I'm in bed by a certain time every night. I know to wear earplugs so I'm not rudely awakened at 6am by toxic family members screaming at each other. I know more about biting off more than I can chew, when I assume I'm medicated and with enough sleep on a certain day. I know what thoughts of mine are not helping or unhealthy, and to try to break out of it and remind myself of my goals in life, what I want to experience and what I want to get done. Everything I do and all effort I put into myself is in accordance with my sole extrinsic motivation which is to impact everyone in my life the best I can, cause I will die one day, and everyone else will continue to exist. Because they continue to exist I want the net suffering to be as low as I can make it. And I feel getting the shit I want done done, will help me in achieving this. As well as a positive and goal oriented outlook.

Right now I'm taking community college classes, 9/10 days I've been sleeping for 8 hours total a day, thanks to the schedule I chose and my attempts to adhere to my habits. I will get an associates in December and go back to the university I flunked out of 3 times before with a change of major. I am practicing at least one of my instruments every day, and I try to write every day. On days I'm unmedicated, I lie on my couch and binge watch netflix and am generally incapable of doing anything really. Oh God this is such a tangent.

Uh, you do have a choice for how you perceive your surroundings, worth, and capabilities. And thus you have a choice for deciding what it is you're going to do about it. Attempts in going through with that choice, knowing you have a dysfunction that directly hinders your ability to do so, can make you prone to suffering. Do your best to avoid that trap, and live positively so that with your handicap, you can live as richful as a life as you're capable of. Because really you can be happy, and you can succeed relatively speaking. But you have to determine for yourself what is success given the hand you've been dealt? And in pursuing it, make sure to praise yourself for each little success along the way, and to not pay any mind to the failings of poorly handled interactions by people you may interact with. Because there's only so much you can do. So do what you can to make things as good as they can be for yourself. 

^ At least that's how I wish that person replied to you lmao. If you want to convince them you could share Russel Barkley's videos.

"8866","You know, I knew about ADHD because my best friend from elementary school had it. 

However, my other friends would shrug it off and say it was a pharmaceutical industry rip off and it gives children the excuse to be disruptive. I never looked back into it until I went to see a psych. 

After I was diagnosed I messaged my friend from elementary, who has Classic ADHD, and she said I probably do not have it. She is very hyper, while I am very reserved, and quiet. She told me to stop looking for an easy way out... out of what?

Many people see ADHD as something that only causes hyperactive activity, but all of the ADHD-PI symptoms match me and my psych diagnosed me as well so I just shrug it off.

My first time taking it I cried because my brain finally shut up (also, midterms) but other than that I don’t notice a huge difference unless I focus on it. Like in the middle of work I’ll be like “wow I got a lot done in the last couple hours because I could actually focus” vs days I don’t take my meds and I’m on my phone a lot more (I work from home right now so distractions are way worse). In general I notice the changes more in little every day things rather than some giant “WOW IT WORKED” life realization.

Also, I forgot to eat a lot when I first took meds because I didn’t feel hungry. I ended up setting alarms and forcing myself to eat a snack/go to the cafeteria because I was losing weight.

Get kids jeans

Take shower

"8932","Thank-you so much for this. We are touching base with her pediatrician in a couple of weeks. Her teacher right now is likely more ideal. She is known for being incredibly structured. That likely has my daughter performing on the higher end of her ability. I thought I might have pulled the trigger too early on the assessment but when the teacher described her to me I realized that my intuition was likely right. I really wish some of what the teacher shared-like the difficulties with transitions-was in the assessment questionnaire she was given. The teacher noted that she already sees perfectionism which worries me because if mixed with untreated ADHD it can be pretty psychologically damaging. For that alone I'm going to keep pushing.

I was a bit shell shocked in the pediatricians office. My daughter was really excited for the appointment (her baby sister also had one) and was all over the place. He is describing how teacher can easily point out ADHD and wondering if she was acting the way she was in the appointment due to immaturity. It's likely both I would guess because maturity lags with ADHD. She does need a proper assessment-which I will advocate for because he clearly doesn't understand ADHD.

I don't really have great advice for you, except make sure you're actually sleeping well (get an app) and find something besides work that makes you want to get out of bed. Even then, you'll probably have to force yourself to do it, so try and have some sort of reward if you get out of the house on time: a frappaccino, etc. I am slow to get up, always have been, but if I get to work early I have time to stop for coffee and read the internet AT WORK so it still feels like I'm easing into the day.

That's not helpful advice, of course. If you're able to see a professional about this, definitely do so. Therapy and/or changes in medication can be a good start. 

Other common advice is to spend at least some time each day outside doing something active. Going for a walk can be enough. I personally dug a hole in our garden to create a rabbit enclosure, but I can't exactly recommend that.

Pinterest has been a lifesaver, seriously. I have a boards for dinner, lunch, snack ideas, a board for 'approved' items (things I've tried and liked), and a board for 'this week.' I like Pinterest because I can browse for a couple of minutes and easily pin things that seem interesting. Then I draw from my boards when it comes to planning time to make up 'this week' menu. From there it's make the list, and order groceries. I hated going to the grocery store and shopping, so ordering groceries (instacart or straight from the stores) has been AMAZING.

You're not interested in buying imaginary properties, but Monopoly is fun.  Online classes can be fun like a board game.  The way to make something fun is to impose some arbitrary rules; you can find some study partners at onlinecollegeclass and plan a time to help with each other's assignments.

"8956","PhD is/was miserable, and I was wildly enthusiastic about research coming into the program.  In my program, there was no structure, my assface advisor refused to give me a regular meeting time (very very important when you are doing proof-based mathematics theory) in the calendar despite constant begging, people were too competitive to get together to work in groups to help give some structure to research/coursework.  Combined with my depressive tendencies, add made life Hell and I descended into a shame spiral that I'm still recovering from.   

I imagine a lab-based program could be easier than my setup for an ADHD because you're surrounded by people each day and are expected to show up to lab each day.

Advice: Take the easiest courseload possible! (just audit things you are interested in beyond the requirements) and get as much help and external motivation (in the form of regular meetings, a reading group, homework groups with peers) early on.  Get to know the staff in your disabilities center and learning center VERY well early on.  Hire an ADHD coach, and/or a psych with an ADD specialization, if at all possible.","czy6ntb",1,1455338846,"2016-02-13 04:47:26"

This, in fact, was one of the main reasons for my diagnosis. My doctor took into account commentary from my wife and work supervisor and weighted it pretty heavily. 
    
But I was actively requesting their input to help me. If your man isn't in that place it might be harder. Good luck!

"8959","I was feeling really tired, and asked my GP if this could be diet related.

He said that the biggest thing that can make you feel tired. So what I started doing was setting an alarm for every day around 8:30 am (even weekends). No sleeping in.

After 2 weeks or so of forcing myself out of bed at that time no matter when I went to sleep I started waking up around that time every day even without an alarm. The result is you end up being tired around midnight or so but you can fall asleep easily.

Extremely worth it, makes weekends feel so much longer. A consequence is that the times I do pull all nighters (party with friends or whatnot) I still wake up around 9 or 10 so I feel a bit groggy but no worse than how I would feel during the week due to sleeping too much.

TL;DR : wake up at the same time every day (including weekends) and you'll be too exhausted to stay up late.

""kitchen chemistry,"" macro econ, psych I, blah blah blah. You can name any subject, I've most likely failed a class in it. Mostly I would just stop going to classes after getting discouraged after getting a B on a test or some other dumb non-reason. In high school the expectation was that I would go to an Ivy or UC Berkeley/LA and I just burned out and spent the next few years continuing to smolder. 

I'm now at a CSU. 3.9something GPA running average over the last two years. Got like a 99.9th percentile score on the med school admissions test. If all goes well I attend med school in 2018. I was ashamed at first to tell people I was at a ""safety school"" but now not so much. Sometimes I find myself criticizing myself over all those years I wasted but it achieves nothing and gets me down and I am not productive at all when I'm in a bad mood. 

The hardest part is letting go of bad habits. Medication gives you transient spurts of motivation not work ethic. What worked for me: I found ways to hold myself accountable. I would sit in the front of the room and answer questions. The expectation that I would participate pressured me to keep up with the readings. I was probably the most annoying person in my O-Chem class, but I got my A. I  force myself to go to a professor's office hours or email them at least once every two weeks. Often I would out of the blue tell a professor I was going to their office hours in advance even if I didn't want to.

We adhd folks are naturally inclined to get caught up in an adrenaline based lifestyle. We seek excitement, thrive on challanges, but all to often excitement and anxiety are closely related. It doesnt need much in terms of trauma to occur to totally tip the scale towards anxiety, with none of the former excitement left.

But... what did it learn me? That while i felt alive i was really dead inside. I lived in my head and chased adrenaline to feel somewhat alive.

Then things happened and cracked me open painfully, with no energy left to even try and escape it all with an external thrill. In hindsight i see it as a good thing, i learned so much afterwards about myself and life, things that i was blind to before as i only had my eye on the adrenaline meter.

"8990","Well, people do sometimes outgrow ADHD. It’s a neurodevelopmental disorder, so it affects things like the chemicals in the brain and the growth and development of different parts of your brain. Some kids brains have the developmental issues associated with ADHD, and then as their brain grows and develops it catches up and adjusts to be like those of their neurotypical peers. So they don’t actually have ADHD anymore. Like how some kids are really small until they have a growth spurt and catch up to the normal height of their peers, but in their brains. Whereas those of us whose brains continue to have the differences associated with ADHD continue on with our ADHD lives, never “growing out of it” just like some people are short their whole lives. 

Edit: I totally agree about over-diagnoses, though. The majority of kids “with ADHD” don’t actually have it. ","e4zxjny",7,1535490770,"2018-08-28 21:12:50"

It's a fallout I have to manage daily thank you very much and it's tough.  My SO is good people and his many good qualities far outweigh any ADHD issues but that doesn't mean those ADHD scars aren't there or are invisible.  My SO seems to think that because there was no screaming or yelling in his house (just cold, angry silence) that his childhood was bliss (as opposed to mine which was full of vitriolic rage from two immature, emotionally disregulated parents - one with profound dyslexia and the other borderline.  My family history is a literal carnival of neurodiversity issues).  What my SO fails to realize is that he WAS impacted, greatly actually, being raised by a distant, emotionally disregulated, non nuturing ADHD parent who was undiagnosed, as well as being raised by a parent who felt slighted because his needs were unmet by the ADHD partner.  My SO's father sulked and was sullen about his feelings for 50 years and did a slow, angry burn about it and then up and left my MIL without a word and now refuses to even be in the same state as her (forget about them being together in the same room for something for the grandkids).  My MIL already suffered from depression because of the undiagnosed ADHD and a divorce in her 80's when she was already starting to see health declines pretty much sealed the deal in terms of her ever accepting that she has an issue or that she will ever seek help for it.  She seems to think that the fact that her granddaughter, who looks and acts JUST LIKE HER is some kind of de nova fluke and only her granddaughter has the ADHD but no one else.

Awareness is half the battle.

My advice is this: if you're concerned about the ever present ""voice"" in your head wondering if you should post something or share it, or that your attention span is being frayed even further, you don't need to cut cold turkey. Addiction is addiction, no matter what and like it or not, your brain enjoys the mindlessness of scrolling and the endorphin release of notifications. Give your friends and family a heads up on the concern and be open and honest with them, along with making sure they have your number and then bounce.

"9020","Perhaps stating the obvious, but the phenomenon of putting stuff off for no good reason, when you **know** you shouldn't, is called [procrastination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination). 
It's a very common human trait. Almost everyone does it. It's just that ADHDers tend to procrastinate a lot more. We are hard-wired for procrastination. 

According to researcher Piers Steel, two of the key factors in motivation are expectancy (your perception of the amount of succes you'll experience) and impulse control (your ability to control your actions in the here and now). 

Guess what. Bad impulse control is pretty much the definition of ADHD. We suck at directing ourselves to do stuff. Our will-power is inherently weak and we get distracted easily. We cannot seem to summon the focus to start something and follow throught, especially if it's a boring job. 

Furthermore, with ADHD you're very likely to grow up hating things that require continuous mental effort. You experience a lot of failure at things that's you're expected to do, like homework or even sitting down and paying attention in class. This causes stress, anxiety, negative thoughts, depression and it f*cking murders your self-confidence. 

So the next time you decide on doing something, your expectancy of actually reaching the goal might be very low, which directly influences your motivation. Think about it: if you believe you're gonna fail anyway (because you've failed so often), you're not gonna be very motivated to actually do it. A vicious cycle. 

So is there a difference between laziness and ""genuine"" ADHD? No. Laziness, or rather behaviour that is percieved as laziness, is very much a product of ADHD. 

This begs the next question: is ADHD a great excuse to just slack off and put off things till the end of days? You decide. In my experience, no excuse is good enough to keep breaking commitments over and over again. People will lose their trust and/or start hating you for it. 
The people who don't are the people who put up with your shit and love you regardless. These people are freaking awesome.

I'm still figuring this shit out, but I would say: 
* set realistic goals. This. 
* avoid stuff that you're bad at. In group projects, I avoid being the person who does the ""administration"". I'm just not good at keeping track of everything. My motivation varies wildly.
* accept failure and be upfront about it. Lying kills trust like nothing else. I for one fucking hate it when people pretend they've been doing a lot when they clearly haven't.
* compensate your ""laziness"" with other things. Focus on the things you're good at, and strive to be awesome t them. 
* surround yourself with people who accept your weak points, and those who can compensate for it.

I've encountered a lot of that. People can tell I'm smart. They then proceed to get pissy when I have difficulty with something.

I always had the right answers, and I always aced the tests, but it took me forever to finish classwork, so they figured I was spaced-out and lazy. That made it okay to make fun of me in front of my peers. I even had one who would have the entire class put their fingers up like alien antennae and chant ""Earth to FelisEros! Earth to FelisEros!"" I considered it a personal victory if I went through an entire day without being shamed.

I went off on a tangent. Sorry.

"9032","So basically, ADHD meds take effect almost immediately, for a limited period of time. Unlike, for example, antidepressants where your brain needs several weeks to chemically reajust when you start, and when you want to stop them you need to progressively decrease the dosage, to prevent withdrawal syndrome. For drugs like Ritalin, you should start again with the dosage you used to take. If 40-50 mg is right for you, don't take a lower dosage, you will be dealing with the frustration of your meds not working like they used to.

That said, I am not a health professional, I don't think your psychiatrist would mind if you ask him, just don't harass him. I mean he gets (and deserves) to be on vacation, your ADHD doesn't. If he is not available, I'm sure your general practitioner can answer that type of question.","eq212sm",1,1559725231,"2019-06-05 09:00:31"
"9033","It is absolutely appropriate for you to talk to your doctor about how you’re feeling and your concerns.

That said, it is also pretty normal to have some unpleasant side effects with many ADHD meds (and also SSRIs and some pain meds, amongst other things) if you’ve been taking a certain dose for a bit and then suddenly stop completely. Your body gets used to having the medication regularly and basically changes the amounts of brain chemicals and so on that it makes, so then when you stop the med your brain chemistry is all thrown off and your body goes ‘wtf? What’s going on?’ for a bit while it adjusts to NOT having the med. Which results in various weird and sometimes unpleasant side effects - my mom had it happen with tramadol (pain med) once when she messed up her knee and was on pain meds for like two weeks - she tried to just stop when her knee hurt less, and she got insanely itchy. Didn’t hurt, just really itchy. She had to taper down instead - like half the dose one day, then a quarter the next, then off. When she did that, she had no problems. So that’s a normal thing to do, too, when you’re going to stop taking a medication that can do this - the doctor prescribes a tapering routine for you depending on the dose you’ve been taking and how the particular medication works and how tolerable the effects you’re getting are. 

(I remember a news story about one person who was like SUPER sensitive to changing doses of the SSRI she’d been on, and would get really bad headaches. So she had to take a long time to taper off and reduce the dose very gradually because the headache was too bad to tolerate much at all. Whereas my mom was able to taper rapidly because she could put up with a little itching, just not being insanely itchy all over.)

Anyway, I’m just saying all this to explain that you should talk to your doctor, but don’t be like super freaking out in the meantime that you’re addicted and omg horrible things will happen, etc. 

(Chemical dependence can LEAD to addiction, but it’s not like a straight line ‘your brain got used to this med, now you need to go to rehab’ you know?)

"9055","Im in exactly the same position man. 17 over here. 
I was diagnosed not too long ago. Exactly same boat with the IQ and exams. Managed to ace almost all my GCSEs (middle school) exams without any issues, just revision done through either exam stress or no revision and just connecting the dots, except for the language subjects, and I think that might be due to my sentence structuring and me loosing track and going on about different things rather than expanding. 

As a kid, you have a lot more energy. I can completely relate, I dont ever remember sleeping in school, not even as a child. Theyd usually put me in another room or let me play on my Gameboy with no volume. 



What youre seeing is a combination of you becoming older, as kids are a lot more hyperactive, and the exams getting a lot more tough. Relatively speaking, you are still more hyperactive than people our age. I expect you have the same issues as me, with sitting in the same place even when doing something, maybe swinging on your chair, constant hand fidgeting?
I asked my doctor what hyperactivity at my age would be considered to be, they said the stuff above. Try and study the people around you, and youll see that people arent as hyperactive as you are. You may not be as hyperactive as you used to be , but you're probably more hyperactive than most people around you. Oh and shaking legs is a big one for me.



Im no doctor, but Im just telling you exactly what ive experienced, and you seem to be experiencing exactly what I have for the most part. 

I was diagnosed formally around a month ago, and I started meds today (hooray), and thanks to my activity tracker that I have on my pc, I could see exactly when and where the meds kicked in. I didnt feel like a robot or enter a ""hyperfocus"".

I was actually able to do work for once. I managed to double what I had done in 9 weeks in a matter of hours. I still got distracted, yes, but I didnt feel the urge to check on that random ass game that I havent played in years. 



My messages to friends got a lot more precise. There was no longer rants and me disagreeing with myself or going on about something for hours. 


Youre probably thinking this might be a placebo effect, but I actually thought the meds were going to last me 10-12 hours, which is what was written on the bottle, where upon checking the amount of work id done I saw that the amount of work done dropped significantly after about 7 hours. It went back to being same as my normal non med workflow. This just basically proved to me that I have problems rather than my brain making up Attention issues. 



I had a short glimpse into what being non-ADHD, non overtalkative is like. 


If you can get tested, do it. Not going to say youre ADHD, but if you can relate to everything I said theres a large possibility

"9075","&gt;Psychostimulants work to regulate impulsive behavior and improve attention span. But the medication also increases the levels of dopamine in the brain - a neurotransmitter linked to addiction - which may increase the likelihood of drug abuse.

Bad sentence, bad sentence.  Low dopamine makes you compulsive and crave things that increase the effective amounts of dopamine.  The sudden swing from low to extreme high makes people seek out drug abuse.  There is a big difference between using ADHD drugs such as stimulants to treat ADHD and using stimulants to get High for often using stimulants to get High has a much higher dose than what is used to treat ADHD.

Now your brain getting chemically addicted to a drug happens with a low dose or a high dose for the chemical addition is a combination of how much of the drug you are taken and how often you take it.","cia4zvd",7,1403038704,"2014-06-17 20:58:24"

Rarely ever have I gotten support from my parents.

So there's probably (**not a doctor**) nothing harmful in the suggestion of only taking them on certain days, but you have to be happy with your medication plan - you're the one who'll be the most affected - and if you're not happy, ask to trial taking them every day; or trial taking them at the psych's recommended intervals and if that doesn't work, ask to try every day.

It shows that you have his best interest at heart and are going to advocate for him to get the best fit medication he possibly can.  Like I responded lower, if it changes him in a negative way you can cease medication immediately and it will stop the bad side affect.  

This sub is here as a resource and has many people who are successfully medicated and those who chose to go unmedicated.  As your child ages keep him involved in the choices.  At 7 he doesn't really know, but at 13 he may decide he wants to try medication or try off of it.  Just make sure you keep those lines of communication and dialogue open.

The meds are life changing but so is just knowing *why* I am the way I am; why I do the things I do. A surprising (to me) number of younger people worry about taking these meds for life and/or don't want to be on them. As someone who has gone so long without them, I honestly cannot understand that position. In the case of other brain issues, most understand meds help and they are needed. Yet ADHD is so stigmatized that some want to try the more natural 'bootstrap' method. 

I don't knock that method, but I do think we should avail ourselves of any help we can. Life is hard. Living with ADHD makes it harder still. There is no shame it taking help - from coping mechanisms to meds and support systems. Whether or not someone seeks help probably isn't going to hurt others, but it sure will hurt us.

Therefore, I want to make it clear that with proper help an ADHDer can get decent-good grades, and that it should not be treated like you have to have bad grades to have the disorder.

I agree with you on everything else, though.  To be ADHD you have to be sick.  You have to be struggling.  You have to be unable to do things that a normal person *should* be able to do.","c9qn7z8",2,1367451712,"2013-05-01 23:41:52"

Also, the structure of school these days for young children is really not developmentally appropriate and doesn't allow them to develop their attention span and ability to focus in a natural way. So there are lots of reasons for young people now to be having issues with concentration and executive functioning, ADHD is one of them but just because someone has those issues doesn't mean they have actual ADHD.

It's time to get to work, tbh. Your mom isn't going to be the parent that you needed to help you develop those neuropathways to exercise better impulse control. That's done and it sucks, but you're not stuck there. There's so much research out there on neuroplasticity, and over and over it shows that we can change our brains as adults. Meds help, tools are out there, and having a good doctor goes a long way. You may want to look into seeing a therapist, and I recently learned that those who focus on family practice don't necessarily need tp treat the whole family. Rather, they help you look at your issues in the context of your family environment. And it sounds like you could really use someone in your corner to help you unpack how that lack of encouragement has affected you.

I can’t help thinking how much better my life could have been with an early diagnosis and treatment. It kills me knowing that I would probably be a doctor or scientist, but now I’m thirty years old and have no chance at either of those things

"9142","I'm one of those ADHD kids who could be called successful academically. I didn't pull a 4.0 average in college, but I've gotten it multiple terms and graduated in the top 10% of my class.

- I *really* wanted it. I had a bad chip on my shoulder. I got bad grades in high school and wanted to prove everyone wrong, that I'm not dumb. I even majored in something I was historically bad at and had little interest in (pure mathematics) just to prove how badass I am. Well, I sort of did that. I'm not sure it was a healthy way to go about things. I purposefully stressed myself out to get motivated. I treated every quiz or assignment like its the end of the world if I don't get every single available point. I would get depressed if I got 9/10 on a small quiz. Treat everything like the end of the world and your body will go into hyper alert/survival mode. 

- I optimized my effort to grade ratio. as in, I picked easy classes, of classes with professors who liked me (independent studies are easy A's. There usually isn't a formal grading mechanism. Unless you really mess up, you'll get an A), or classes with take home exams. I can do math exams just fine. I just can't have time pressure. Basically, I hacked the system for easy A's in my last two years. In my first two years, I made myself nervous for every little thing. For my last two years, I basically stole the A's from right under the administration's nose.

- of course you could also try picking something you would naturally want to hyperfocus on anyway. This is not what I did. My best friend in college also had ADHD and he did really well in the major he loved; as in he's one of the best in his major. He pulled straight B's though. Only because he refused to do the assignments. He aced tests with low effort. I recommend his attitude over mine.

- smarts. Sounds ugly but has to be said. Lots of kids who don't have ADHD don't pull 4.0's (and some ADHD kids I know do- my boyfriend has mild ADHD- and an IQ of 160+. He coasted through college and had a straight 4.0 average). Just because you're on meds is no guarantee that you will turn into one of those people who do. I'm not sure you should be gunning for that anyway. 

I sort of destroyed myself in college trying to do that. I became a humorless nervous wreck. I'm now in my first term of a PhD program. I'm ready to drop out. I can't take it anymore. Years of stress to no real benefit.

Remember. No effort and no ADHD treatment is a guarantee of not getting a 4.0. But effort and treatment is no guarantee of 4.0.","czx71o1",1,1455277392,"2016-02-12 11:43:12"

It was such a huge relief and ""tears of joy"" moment when someone finally allowed me the diagnosis and was willing to prescribe medications.  It's still a long road ahead, but so much weight was lifted just by the diagnosis (which really means by someone listening and acknowledging my struggles).

  This can be a blessing in disguise.  
  
  A lot of us end up with a hodgepodge of bad habits and misunderstandings when it comes to how we approach academics.  The only really way to fix that is to start from the foundation.  And, as painful as it is now, you have a fresh foundation to build this back better.  Do research, get help, and make informed changes with contingency plans that can help keep you accountable.  If you do this right, you can have something really nice, and genuinely laudable, eventually.  Don't know how long it'll take, feeling the payoff is more a matter of when certain needs get met, but it's worth it.

"9148","I work as a medical receptionist and in my experience specialists in centres like these will palm off as much work as possible so they have maximum time to just consult. I've known an eye specialist who had nurses and staff prepare his patients (bibs on, eye drops in, lights dimmed, chair adjusted) so all he had to do was walk in and consult. He'd have 2 rooms going at a time, consulting in one while the other was prepping. $235 for a 10min appointment makes it worth paying 2 staff $24/hour to prep your patients for you.

Is this normal? Yeah, unless you find a lone practitioner like mine but these health centres are the popular business model. 

Is it good? You want to feel a continuation of care. Once a diagnosis is made you probably won't see the psych who did the assessment again and you'll see the psychiatrist only occasionally for prescriptions and treatment follow up. The psychologist you first saw will probably be the only one you'll see regularly. It will be good once that happens.
Sometimes in centres like these, they'll try and book you in with anyone available but feel free to put your foot down and request who you want to see. Once you have a connection with a psychologist, they are not easily interchangeable others.

Are they raping your wallet? You betcha! Oh, it hurts, it hurts. The way I see it, spending a bit of money now to take care of myself long term is worth it. At least they didn't send you to a neurologist.","cquysce",2,1430486822,"2015-05-01 13:27:02"

You need to make sure he's taking his meds. If they are not working, you need to help him and get his ass back to the doctors to find something that works.

The piles are a sign that he needs meds. He lacks the motivation to put them away AND he's irritated you want him to move his stuff. This happens to me but at some point I can't stand the clutter and clean it up (until I lose interest lol). Btw, the piles everywhere are visual clues so he can easily find them again. It's an out of site out of mind thing. If he sees it everyday, he knows exactly where it is otherwise he'll spend hours trying to find where he put that damn tool. 

Getting him a mechanics tool chest will help tremendously if he doesn't already have one. I bought a tool chest and now, my tools are around or near the tool chest lol, rather that all over the place. 

If you can't afford a tool chest, dedicate a space for him and get stackable clear plastic bins for his tools so he can stay organized.  It will eliminate the visual clutter giving you some piece of mind and at the same time, he can see the tools giving him piece of mind.

Try and stay positive, I know it's hard for you and it's very stressful. But he's got to want to help himself. He's got to see that he's hurting you by not wanting to make a comfortable living space. No one should live in an uncomfortable environment.

The important thing is to do it regularly, and schedule it so you're on medication at the right times. Don't wake up and take 20mg every day, because if you are going out to brunch or something it will be excessive.

for me every day around 9am I've got all my stuff roughly planned out and I usually know that nothing urgent will come up for a few hours, so I take my adderall and get to work. I use all the productivity tips I need, and take a break here and there. From that point on I taper down the intensity of my productivity tasks, sometimes I keep getting stuff done, sometimes that's it for the day.

TLDR: I am a lifelong gamer. When I was in my late teens, single player games started becoming boring, especially after discovering my first MMORPG. After breaking the MMO addiction about a decade ago, I now I play multiplayer shooters and such.

I really think what you’re experiencing is just part of getting older and smarter. Games really are such a finite, limited thing, in the sense that they are boxed in, there are limits to what you can do in a game. The simplest example I can give, for the sake of clarity, is a game like Pokémon for gameboy. I’m guessing there are guides/YouTube videos out there that have broken the game down to a recipe where if you follow the steps, you can beat the game in under an hour or something ridiculous like that. Humans are smart. We figure these things out and eventually we will exploit what can be exploited and we will suck that bowl of soup dry until there’s not a drop left to scoop up. Games seem more and more limited to me as I get older.

Here’s personal example that I think explains this: I remember getting really hooked on Medieval Total War when I was about 10 or so. I thought I was a tactical mastermind, outflanking and destroying every enemy army that came at me. But then one day it dawned on me that I wasn’t particularly amazing or smart at this— the AI was just dumb and was basically letting me flank it and kept making huge mistakes. Which is probably why many of us enjoy multiplayer games. I personally believe that gamers who only like single player games and complain about multiplayer games being full of too many toxic people, etc. are lacking in people skills and can’t deal with real world problems or conflict if they can’t even handle a bit of adversity on a video game, but I understand this is a controversial and possibly unfounded opinion.

The other thing you may be experiencing is that other tasks and events in your life become more significant and interesting. Responsibilities, as well as fun things like girls (or whatever you find attractive). My gaming mates know that my love life is going well if I’m not gaming. 

Vermintide 2 has been the best game in a long time for me because not only is it highly satisfying and full of variation, the games are relatively quick so it’s great for a few quick games after a hard day’s work.

Now here’s a RANT WARNING:

I think that survival games like Rust, Arc, Conan: Exiles, etc. should be avoided by ADHD people or at least be wary of them, folks! If you’re not sure if any of your friends have ADHD, get them to play a survival game with you and you’ll quickly see who has it. My ADHD friends have been completely sucked into games like that where they’ll not be able to stop playing for very long periods and they become extremely irritable due to a combination of lack of sleep, as well as the inherent annoyance that comes with these sorts of games.

Wholesome rant:

I have been playing less and less video games lately and now I’m at the point where I don’t even want to play them because I’ve discovered Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. As I said, I’ve been a lifelong gamer, and was always quite a skinny, pale, nerdy dude. But in recent years I’ve been working on my physical health by exercising etc and just last month I tried a free week of Jiu Jitsu classes and it has given my mind something really healthy to focus on that maintains my anxiety and channeled chaotic stream of thoughts in a helpful and fun way. And to top it off, it’s like a game but there really aren’t limits in terms of the skill ceiling. You can do it for 10+ years and keep getting better and it stays fun. Not many video games are like that and they don’t bleed into the rest of your life in a healthy way like this sort of thing does.

For instance, here’s an instant benefit I got: Every time I’ve ever had some big, rare event to wake up for early in the morning, I’ve not slept well because I’m worried I will do badly at the exam/job interview, etc. if I don’t sleep well. Or I’ll worry that I’ll sleep through my alarm. So this week, the night before an early morning exam for my psychology degree, I decided I was going to go to jiu jitsu class regardless. And that night I didn’t even think of my exam and slept like any other night and I did really well on the exam.

P.S. I’m new, so if this violates the rules and/or counts as derailing the thread I’m happy to make my own, just let me know 😊

"9186","Mechanical engineer you say? As an engineer that graduated about 2.5 years ago let's see what I can think of... 

Companies don’t care about your experience as much as they say they do. They care about your GPA more than just about everything else. They *SAY* that engineering students don’t have enough experience or time on the shop floor but that haven’t done a single thing to change their hiring practices. 

Your GPA is mathematically designed to bring your grade down, no matter what your actual grade average is. If you got 100% in every class you ever took your GPA would be 4.0. If you were to try and translate this back into a percentage grade a 4.0 GPA = 93% (depending on your school).

Your grade | your resultant GPA | that GPA converted back into grade average
:--| :--| :--|
92.9% | 3.7 | 90.0%
90.0% | 3.7 | 90.0%

But I was warned that as an adult I might feel a bit sad about the result thinking how life could have been different. Good to becprepared for and maybe have someone you can talk to about that, it is a part of the journey.

Also, my doctor says we will not settle with the first just because it feels better, you should feel optimal. As someone said, don't have hopes on what medicine.

On another thought have you noticed him siting any differently when he is on adderall? What is his profession? Adderall tends to make me lift more in the gym, and sometimes I don't notice as much fatigue. Maybe he is working extra hard at work without noticing it.

Unfortunately, unless they are willing to open up to you and trust you giving them space and time will not help. While it sucks to micromanage it might be the only way to ensure that something gets done.

My boss and I recently (few months ago) had a sit down where he explained that I'm always busy but sometimes tasks are getting lost. He doesn't have time, nor wants, to micromanage me. We set up a weekly hour long meeting where I would keep a weekly TODO list as well as a quarterly list of large projects. 

Every week we go over the list in detail. He asks questions about the projects, run the business work, ect and I can use that time to request information or help.

You came up with a creative and awesome idea and you were enthusiastic about it until you actually had to make your thoughts into something real.

Because your brain is really good at envisioning stuff and holding deep effection for them, but terrible when it comes to focusing on one thing at a time and being flexible towards an idea, you hit the same dilemma we all go through.

I went through the same thing on a project that meant a lot to me, and my expectations and anxiety over it led to a less than desirable product and weeks of unnecessary suffering. I knew that I had to sacrifice my impossible standard and settle for something realistic that I could still enjoy but I was too stubborn and paid the price.

Welcome to ranttit!

&gt;I've always been a good student. Straight A student, an over achiever. My ADHD wasn't discovered until I was 17, because teachers and other adults would look past my symptoms since I still managed to ace all my exams. 

Your lucky! Imagine being in your 40s or 50s and how pissed you would be at losing more than half of your life to this **'Prison of Potential'**, __A__lso __K__now __A__s __'ADHD'__.

&gt; I fear telling people about my diagnosis because the times I have I have gotten one of the two following responses:

Why tell them?  I think knowing the reason why helps with the fear because then you will know how and what to do and say. 

Wait until you know why you want to tell them and then wait some more to see if this reason changes. 

&gt;""*Really?* But you are so smart"" (what they don't realize is that I don't just get good grades, I spend hours upon hours trying to finish simple assignments because I can't concentrate) 

This is why I say wait.  What did you hope to get out of the above disclosure? They will never understand what you have to go through to get shit done and will resent the hell out of you if you are ever truly able to show them what it feels like to be in your skin. Just be thankful that your not perfect so you don't have to work hard at feeling empathy for others who are not perfect.

I tell someone I have ADHD as much as I tell someone I love them. Not too often and not to very many people. Think of ADHD disclosure like that, it has an effect on the sender and receiver and not taken lightly. Fortunately every understands love but few understand ADHD or will take the time to try. 

I make it easier by finding something easy to read for them on the topic.

&gt; or ""Haha, if *you* have ADHD, imagine what I might have!"" (this was said by one of my ""random"" friends, who seems to think that ADHD= * holds up spork *)

[Never look a gift (compliment) horse in the mouth.](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/look+a+gift+horse+in+the+mouth)

&gt; It is so frustrating that people don't take me seriously when I try to talk to them about how I feel. 

Yes it is and it will always be. BUT when you realize, that is is extremely hard for people to 'feel' how you feel then it gets easier. What beats this feeling is meeting someone half way.  

I could never hope to truly feel what it is like to have psychosis but having ADHD makes me willing to do the work to try to understand the pain they feel. 

&gt;When I say that I didn't get anything done last night because I could not concentrate it does not mean that I tried for 5 minutes and then gave up and watched TV instead, it means that I sat there for HOURS and still only managed to write three scentences. 

['Eighty - Ninety percent of success is showing up.](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/). 

You showed up for hour at your desk! That shows that you will be successful, believe me! Which one of your friends would have done that, and then use that as a representative sample of your colleagues in a company.  




&gt;I'm often met with ""Oh, why are you complaining, you´re still gonna get an A!"" and before exams I've gotten ""I wish we could swith brains!"" several times.

[""Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot."" - Charlie Chaplin](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/c/charliecha102081.html)

&gt;What they don't realize is that wish that too! I would give anything not to be chronically stressed because I can't get stuff done, to not spend every waking hour completely exhausted only to not be able to fall asleep without laying awake for hours. What for them is a normal conversation is for me a huge effort, I have to keep my focus on what they are saying, I have to stop myself from interrupting them and I have to close out all of the distractions surrounding me. It is exhausting and I just get really sad that they take this gift for granted. 

I think this everyday. You are not alone.

&gt;Sorry if it's a bit incoherent but I just needed to get it out of my system because it has been bothering me for quite some time. 

 [Read this list of Quotes from this great man and see if any strike you of him having ADHD.](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/charlie_chaplin.html). Then write back how you feel about yourself. My theory is that a lot of great people had ADHD that would of went on to become assholes if they were not given a dose of sudden unpredictable failure every now and then.

# ADHD is an Everest; but it can be summited with help.

The best help is kindness and love; kindness to others and love to yourself.

Also the question of “laziness vs actual ADHD,” gets knocked around a lot this sub, and people will give really convincing answers like “laziness is a motivational issue but people with ADHD can have motivation and still not be able to do it,” but then when we look through the pity posts in the rest of the sub we see a bunch of hypocritical posts about being lazy or unmotivated and then blaming it on our ADHD.

Here’s my advice. 

TL/DR: external structure, novelty and habits

—-

Monkey’s list

- this list long because I have had lots of problems, maybe one solution can help you, don’t worry I am plenty messed up still 

- Read the FAQs on this reddit  as well as this list

- Take what you want leave the rest this is my cut and paste list for anyone who asks for “any advice” 

- Get assessed/keep in touch with your prescriber about problems

- It is possible to be gifted and have ADHD or average or low IQ and have ADHD. It is a disorder of restlessness, dysregulated attention and impulsivity; not a scholastic disorder. But lots of us have things like dyslexia. And not everyone is physically hyperactive.

- If you are here you have permission to use hard-won ADHD life hacks whether you have it or not.

- watch “HowToADHD” on YouTube.

- “Taking Charge of Adult ADHD” by Dr Russell Barkley 

- “Driven to Distraction” by Dr Ned Hallowell

- there are free summaries of some of these or versions on YouTube 

—-

The list itself these are all genuine solutions to my own real ADHD issues:

- have one pen

- If you think you have high BP on meds make sure you are checking BP correctly especially posture, cuff size, and rest  https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg127/chapter/1-Guidance#measuring-blood-pressure

- Only two books by your bedside: one fiction one non

- Never use willpower when routine can be developed; but be extra careful with new routines; mine take me about 6 weeks

- never remember anything when you can write it down

- routines are a hard shell that protects you from dumb mistakes. But like an organisms shell it may seem stiff to others, it needs to be shed as you grow, and you are exposed while it sets

- Lists for routines especially learning them and saying them out loud

- Paper lists for short term tasks like shopping

- Sleep https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sleep-and-tiredness/10-tips-to-beat-insomnia/

- Don’t beat yourself up

- Meditation

- Healthy diet

- Effective medication leverages all the other points

- if you are on a controlled drug you might want to call the pharmacy in advance: saves me time

- Mindfulness: free apps or Kabat-Zinn are good starters

- I avoid the sort of unusually low blood sugar I get if I exercise in a fasted state - I get really absent minded and grouchy

- Delegate things you are bad at if possible

- background chill music or house music when you work. No lyrics, or at least foreign lyrics

- Bullet journal https://youtu.be/5hLnY9L1c-M

- sense of humour

- tell your prescriber when you have ideas about meds

- a launchpad, i.e. an area where things needed for leaving the house are kept

- you may get earworms which are those repetitive musical phrases. Sometime they are telling you something from deep in your mind, sometimes they are just your mind fidgeting, like a screensaver. Don’t resist them they are not madness. 

- You might have low self esteem, it is a treatable complication of ADHD... this can extend to making you doubt your diagnosis. Try to leverage this experience into forgiving others their faults

- Pockets with zippers

- if you hyperfocus still try to take breaks using a timer, it’s a double edged sword

- if you hyperfocus drop your shoulders

- Check your pockets when you leave or enter a building or vehicle

- Try to have a meeting with your spouse about calendar dates from time to time

- communicate simply

- set your meds for the next day out the night before e.g. beside your bed and in your wallet. Less chance of forgetting and/or freaking out questioning double doses.

- poor sleep knocks about a third off my medication effectiveness.

- buy a timer cookie jar for your phone or other distraction. Throw it in for 30mins and break the compulsive screen time. 

- Put your jewellery ring on your keys for swimming etc or your watch strap when you take them off at night

- It can take up to six months to get your dose right; but for me day one was miles better than no meds

- Too high a dose can lead to similar symptoms. Start low, go slow. I went 18mg, 36mg, 54mg, then back to 36mg. 36mg worked until about 2pm so I get two little 5mg boosters for afternoon and evening

- about 80% people respond to something

- Effective meds reduce risky behaviour like alcohol, smoking, staying up late, eating crap

- Meds reduce accidents, normalise brain structure and function over time, and are probably safe from cardiovascular point of view based on my reading of evidence though it’s hard to get good science on this

- exercise helps, particularly interval training

- Try to to moderate caffeine and alcohol.

- You may have money issues. Read Alvin Hall and Ben Fry but before you buy things say these out loud: Do I need this; Can I afford this; Can I get this cheaper somewhere else

- alarms not sense of time

- do it badly but do it then make it better","ehpongf",1,1551637797,"2019-03-03 18:29:57"

"9287","A major difficulty for a psychiatrist/psychologist is trying to differentiate between a neurological disease and a mental disease.  

A good psychiatrist will spend several sessions trying to figure the differences out. There are cases were it's fairly clear due to having other people's perspectives, a documented history of behavioural symptoms (10's of years worth of school report cards for instance, thanks mum that helped a lot!), etc.  

What makes it even more difficult is underlying neurological disorders can make a person more susceptible to acquiring mental disorders, as is shown by the evidence of a very high level of comorbid diagnosis for developmental issues like ADHD.  
To make it harder again, those mental disorders often cause similar symptoms to those of neurological disorders, indeed they can compound on each other in the case of co-morbid disorders.  

Then finally the major issue for accurately assessing ADHD is the 1st line treatment is a stimulant of a the amphetamine type. Dexamphetamine or methylphenidate are the two major ones.  
These particular medications are very powerful psychoactive substances and can make certain symptoms of various disorders *worse*, dangerously so in the case of various personality disorders.  
This is why the psychotic spectrum disorders need to be treated via appropriate medication first, to gain a level of control, before the addition of stimulants to address the underlying neurological issue.","ddo4aw9",3,1486948558,"2017-02-13 01:15:58"

"9300","Dude, I know how you feel. I just started Straterra a little over a week and a half ago and it is slowly giving me the motivation to at least try. Before I had anything I was cycling through depressive spells a lot. Most of this is due to my life feeling a big stagnant which, will change soon, as I am moving out with the love of my life in the next month or two! :) Although, even with the actual factual knowledge that it will get better... my brain still decided that depression was the way to go! X_X Fortunately, I feel like I am beginning to dig myself out of this rut and so am sure you will too!

As hard as it is, try to remind yourself that ""IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD"". You don't have as much to be depressed about as some people at least! One thing that has put some of this into perspective for me is that a friend of mine lost his one year old last week and that is cause for real sadness. The shit that cycles through our minds is not. Remember that each day we are alive is a gift. The gift may not feel like the perfect match at the moment, but it will grow on you if you let it  Take o e day at a time and remember, you are stronger than your brain. Give the SSRI a few more weeks and I am sure you will begin to feel better. If you haven't tried exercising, give it a shot. It is making me feel a bit better emotionally and physically. You could also try meditation to let your mind center itself.

"9305","Hi past me from a few months ago! 

Sounds like you are similar to me for documenting and titrating meds. Yes us!! 

I also decided to stick with methylpenidate and did two week reviews for months till we got it right (my job means i can't be fatigued)

So given that you will appreciate the differences, and you have lexapro on board, here's a short version of my journey. 

- Ritalin IR 10mg. Increased the amounts per day to 40mg getting a good idea of when it starts working and fades out. 

- switched to Ritalin 20mg sr disaster (brands make a difference) 

- started concerta 27mg with Ritalin 10mg ir for backup. Mumbling fatigue at times. Moody!! 

- concerta 36mg with IR backup because doc trusts me by now. Too much, waves too variable. Side effects of dry mouth etc too difficult to manage. 

- back to and now settled happily in concerta 27mg with two Ritalin 10mg IR for me to use around shift work. 

Depending on my work roster, i generally take 10mg first thing then 27mg an hour or so later. Sometimes i do not need the second ir but i keep it on me and am very aware now of what the feelings are where i need to take another one to stay functional and avoid the fatigue. 

One main hint for me, which is humbling, is my speech becomes more negative. So doing daily mindfulness training is a must so i can hear the thoughts or words which let me know my brain is slipping down gears. 

Coffee is an addiction i am working around. Somedays i win somedays i decide to take the consequences - typical addiction behaviour really :)

And for those with female hormones - i am lucky to have some higher dose pills still, and i definetly need to take one on days when i am pre menstrual. The methylpendidate is less effective in very obvious ways during that time. 

I am blessed with a trusting doc, but to be fair i used the medisafe app rigourously and really documented everything. It was exhausting!! 

Tl;Dr titrating will work. Be kind to yourself and humble and watch for mood markers as well physical effects. 

All the best, from a nurse with adhd! ","ec5cf9y",3,1545265041,"2018-12-20 00:17:21"

So there's some good advice ITT. Get out of the room you're in. If your anxiety has you not leaving the house (it often does for me) then a shower and clean clothes will help. 

If you can read a book for a while, that's great. Sometimes the 'boredom' (panic attack) gets so overwhelming in its ennui that it takes something drastically weird to kick me into getting up. 

Masturbation helps in lowering blood pressure, releases endorphins, regulates breathing. The whole works.

It's like....at the mere thought of something that stresses me out, my hyperactive mind goes into overdrive and feeds me and endless stream of exaggerated and dramatized scenarios in which I horribly fail at whatever task it is that I'm trying to do. Then my mind tells me just to engage in escapist activities to distract me.

Here's my advice. The thing that's worked best for me is simply, specifically when it comes to late work, is trying to disregard urgency of the task, while of course at the same taking measures to completely isolate yourself from the things that distract you the most. I know it seems as though not taking the urgency into account will only cause you to go into a false sense of security and continue procrastinating, but the key in this strategy is also making sure to get rid of prime distractions.

As people with ADHD/ADD, we tend to do our best work when there isn't much pressure on us, and when we're genuinely interested in the subject matter at hand, that's how hyper-focus works. So, all you need to do is get into a mindset where you tell yourself ""ok, this work is already late, that's not going to change, there's literally no way for me to get this done on time anymore, so the best I can do is take the time necessary to complete this task to the best of my ability."" And then, after you isolate yourself from your usual distractions, you will automatically begin to develop an interest in actually completing the task, because in that moment, from the point of view of your mind it's the next best thing when it comes to gaining external stimulation. Again, it might seem counter intuitive, but telling myself ""there is no time limit"" has substantially helped me in reducing stress and upping the quality of my work.","g9fw933",1,1603207863,"2020-10-20 15:31:03"

If they’re gonna give life-changing meds to children, people need to first figure out why the child is having difficulty with behavior- in my stepdad’s case, he was so unmanageable- think like oppositional defiance disorder level of terrible. That could probably have been solved if his parents tried to actually be there for him. But the weren’t, and he was kinda neglected emotionally. Instead, they gave him meds and sent him on his way. 
Meds aren’t a miracle. They are a tool. Like a coat- you wear it when you’re cold, but if it’s warm, don’t. You will need to also wear gloves and things to keep yourself warm as well. 
Maybe that wasn’t the best analogy.

"9409","I don't have a perfect solution to stocking my kitchen, but a few things have helped. 

Step 1 - years in retail gave me an awareness of inventory management. I bought a Brother label maker, and went a little crazy with the 5S technique, labeling the storage location for EVERY DAMN THING in my kitchen. Therefore, when I'm getting low on something, I know where to look first. 

Step 2 - I try to keep a target inventory level for staples. Milk? 4 half-gallon containers (kids!). Peanut butter? One open, one at the ready (I number the lids with a sharpie.) When I am below target inventory, the item goes on the whiteboard shopping list on the fridge. There are a few things that I will buy in bulk regularly, and a few others that I will stock up on when there's a great sale. I have to be sure to ""protect"" the storage locations for those things (yay, labels!!) so I don't stash other crap there.

Step 3 - I am religious about ONLY shopping from the whiteboard list. I take a snap of it with my phone on my way out of the house if there is any chance at all that I might end up near a store. (When I'm bored/in line/waiting for a commercial to end, I go through my pictures and purge old ones.)

I totally feel you. Same exact thing. The thing that I try to remember, and that I (kindly and educationally) tell other folks when I remember to is that the word “disorder” is an important one.

A disorder is, by definition, something that causes undue distress and a lack of stability in one’s life. If these people are able to function just fine, even when forgetting a work obligation 1/50 times, then they just *do not* have a disorder.

So if you ever hear that sort of thing out of someone again, just explain that to them (politely), and kindly ask them not to make those sorts of remarks in the future—not just with you, but with every ADHD person they meet.

"9451","That euphoric feeing disappeared within 3-4 days and my psych told me that it will. Do not chase the chemical induced euphoria this does not mean medication works, and how to react on medication does not confirm whether or not you have ADHD. Just generalize this, adhd lack of neurotransmitters and medication level them up to normal whereas those who dont have chemical imbalance in the brain, meds can increase the neurotransmitters and give them hyperactivity or sort of chemical induced schizophrenic symptoms. I dont know this is valid or not. But when I meds kick and I can feel it, I become more calm and focus things i want to. 

Im prescribed 20mg daily but i can manage myself with 15mg with great result. Some said that you should not feel anything or kicks in feeling. The meds are not magical pill you still gotta do what you have to do ","d78jj9m",2,1472945799,"2016-09-03 23:36:39"

If you want to force it, I guess you can say that adhd creates a ""time-blindness"" or difficulty seeing the medium and long term consequences of your actions. So if you want to succeed with adhd, especially without treatment, you have to work in a process oriented way, and results oriented settings create particular difficulties at the time of evaluation or when the result is determined, because the disability can spur a reaction to the results which is not ideal.

"9457","Let me break down a few things so you can gain some perspective, and I apologize for my broad speculating here because I don't have a lot of detail from you to reflect on. But I'll do my best to give you some analysis so you can more or less gain insight and introspection into what he is experiencing right about now, because I've been there my friend, believe me...

Men are prideful by default, we bottle all of our emotions because of societal pressures convince us that it's a sign of weakness if we do, and it's just silliness. Your husband I'm sure has known about this for a lot longer than you might have imagined, and he's at the stage where his pride and dismissal has turned into fear and depression because the years of failure and self-doubt has profound psychological and emotional devastation that is only natural for many people first discovering they learn they have a disorder. And it's not just the learning deficit which has  fractured his self-esteem, but the impact ADHD has on the ones closest to him. It's a vicious cycle to deal with.

To admit he has ADHD is to admit he is a broken clock, and right now he is convinced he can't be fixed. It's text book depression. To do twice as hard work as everyone but only do half as well. And this is consistent throughout his entire life. It is equally frustrating for him also because the disorder is misunderstood; many individuals dismiss it as an excuse for being lazy or simply being dumb, and unfortunately many buy into that narrative of being dumb or lazy. Hence why he's afraid to express to anyone what is going on inside him for the fear that they will marginalize his problem or worse, judge him. And I wouldn't be suprised if he's already experienced that with his family or close friends. The unfortunate reality though is people will judge him, you ask anyone here and you will get a story about how people look at you differently when you openly tell them you have ADHD. So part of his fear of expressing himself to others is warranted. 

The other fear is actually seeing a psychiatrist. To open yourself up completely to a stranger is one of the most difficult and uncomfortable situations someone can experience. Simply being there exacerbates your anxiety, what you might or might not say, or how the psychiatrist will react. Thoughts and emotions are racing at a million miles per hour that it becomes almost impossible to think clearly. Picturing that situation is terrifying for him because facing that infinite void of uncertainty reinforces his innner self criticism. It makes him feel inadequate and helpless as a husband. 

But there is hope...

First off, it is really courageous of you actively looking for guidance, it is a strong indication that you do love him and are already looking to tackle the issue head on, so my hats off to you. Second, like many of some of the other comments have already said, start watching YouTube videos of Dr. Russell Barkley because he breaks down the complexities of ADHD into a digestable clear form. Also, consider reading the book [Driven To Distraction](http://www.amazon.com/Driven-Distraction-Recognizing-Attention-Childhood/dp/0684801280) because it's usually my go to book for anyone wanting to learn more about the disorder. 

There is a reason why ADHD is one of the most misunderstood disorders is because how easily people misinterpret it, so knowing where the ADHD ends and the real person begins is **absolutely critical** for a relationship to work because it will not only help you understand him more, but also shows him that you're his emotional rock because it is so easy for him to give up on himself which is one of the hallmarks of ADHD. You'll soon learn (if you haven't already of course) how easy your husband can lose control of his emotional regulation and why it is easily confused with Bipolar, because the symptoms are comorbid and can easily get criss-crossed and that is also why you need to educate yourself on the disorder because you are going will see other diorders that can easily be confused as ADHD. 

This is not going to be an easy battle, in fact you will have a lot of ups and downs in the coming future but being mentally prepared will ameliorate those turbulent times when they do come. Remind him that having ADHD isn't the end of his life, it's a daily struggle but there are millions of Americans who are also in the same boat as him, and that he needs to understand he has you to support him. But in the end only he can decide if he wants to fix himself, and even with all the love and support that you throw at him, he ultimately has to decide if he wants to seek medical help because if it is truly ADHD then you are simply out of you depth on this one. Just remember the context of what he is experiencing and don't pressure him too hard because it can sometimes backfire if he feels like he is being put in a corner, but he is your husband so you know all his idiosyncrasies and where to draw the line, trust your instincts. Also, /u/roland00 makes a strong point on his post so listen to what he has to say.

I'll end here but leave you a few pointers for the coming days and weeks as you learn about the disorder while addressing his concerns about seeing pdoc. Just remember though... a diagnosis can be quite liberating honestly for him and you, suddenly everything makes sense and it is the impact plus the sensitivity of that truth which will have the most lasting and positive effect for your relationship to grow and be nurtured. Like the opening chapter in a book, this is where his story and yours begins, make it a good one.

**Things you should not do:**

- tell him not to worry

- mistake praise for comfort

- constantly badger him to “get help”

- force him to be more vocal to friends and colleagues

- force him to do things that trigger his fragile state

- “face your fears” doesn’t always work

- because—remember—he is scared of everything right now

- in fact, it would be more accurate to say he is scared of the fear itself.

**Things you can do for him:**

- be calm

- be patient

- don’t be condescending

- remind him he's not “crazy”

- IT. IS. OK.

- it’s okay to be scared. It’s okay to be scared of being scared

- he is not a freak

- he is not a failure

- you know he feels isolated because of it

- don't force him to take emotional armor

- remind him he's not alone

- tell him you love him

- make him rib-eye steak (yea I threw that one in there)

- fuck some noobs up in some Warsong Gulch together

The clearness should be the expected result.

I've never gotten dizzy or had my heart rate increase noticeably from any of my medication, including Concerta.  That is not normal.

That sort of restless feeling is how I get if I take more than the recommended dose (which is not recommended).  Normal for the meds in general, but probably not normal for a normal-sized dose.

The headache and pressure MAY just be severe dehydration.  When my medicine works, I have to drink several glasses of water an hour just to stay hydrated.  This may also be something terrible; I'm not a doctor.

I didn't mean that you should run away, only that it is a much preferred alternative to killing yourself, If you were to phone your parents (or someone that cares about you, or a help line) and tell them that your options right now are shooting yourself in the head or moving to Nicaragua, They will all tell you that they will come visit you in Nicaragua. Please don't kill yourself, you have value and worth and even if I don't know you i'll miss you...

Jokes aside, I think this is one of the biggest challenges I face. It pervades my entire life, all my responsibilities and pleasures. I want to get better at photography and calligraphy, but there's just zero willpower when I pick up my camera and pen.

New things seem much more important to us. After that ""honeymoon period"", when I realise how much a hobby, new skill or intellectual pursuit really will cost in terms of time and effort, my interest levels just drop to the floor, and I end up jumping ship. It's just how ADHD works, where mentally arranging long term tasks with delayed gratification take a backseat to short term and novel ones, and the planning and memory get lost in the switch. At least that's how I understand Russell Barkley's neuropsychological explanation. (Watch these if you haven't already. Links are in the subreddit wiki)

It's like how I despise collectible card games and turn and team based RPG, despite my wide love of video games. I enjoy them immensely initially - just as much as any other games - but when I'm a few hours in, and realise there are 1000s of different permutations to learn, each with strengths and weaknessess.. I start to think about how I could be playing an FPS instead..

"9517","Hi, friend! Remember that EVERYONE (including neurotypical people) needs recharge days. They way you are feeling is SUPER FRUSTRATING, I know. But it is NOT evidence of you failing. 

Have you had enough water the last few days? I've noticed that dehydration is one major cause for my foggy ambient anxiety days. Have you gotten enough sleep? Did you get work done the past few days, or were you putting it aside for the ""rush"" to build up?

I have been trying, lately, to make better use of the days when I'm feeling too overwhelmed or groggy or both to get ""work"" done. I've been trying to do some journaling, which for me is just listing and/or train of thought word vomit. I'm finding it useful when it comes to more objectively inspecting what might be going on that I DO have control over (like, being dehydrated) so that I can try to take better care of myself moving forward.

Yesterday I had a foggy, frustrating day. I had a lot I wanted to get done, but things went wrong. I took my meds late, puked up my first pill (black tea on an empty stomach is not my friend), screwed around on Reddit for too long, didn't drink enough water (yesterday or the day before), kept getting distracted and anxious and frustrated, and by 3pm hadn't done JACK.

And then I decided to just do a *little* bit of *easy* work, and so I did, and I count that as a win.

I had 8 hrs of work planned, but I actually worked, as a frustratingly slow pace, for 2. And I'm calling it a win.

Take yourself for a walk, if you can. Give yourself the day off, if you can. If you're feeling better later, great! Maybe you can get an hour or two of work done. But if you still feel foggy and overwhelmed at 4? Do something nice for yourself instead. Take an indulgently long, hot shower. Make yourself hot cocoa. Do a little yoga. 

EVERYONE needs days off. You are no a machine. This won't last. You'll likely feel different tomorrow. You are normal. You are ok. Everything is ok.","ea1ej9a",3,1542642166,"2018-11-19 15:42:46"

My blood pressure. Dangerous. But I noticed something


So way back In the day I was prescribed vyvance, I remember not liking the side  effect of circulation loss in my legs. Or so it felt. 

That's when I was prescribed adderall, stayed on it for a year, off for 8 years and back on for a year. 

Then I tried mydayis and HOLYFXCK my body went for a train ride. Listen, call me crazy idc... I must have had a bad reaction because ever since my first day of mydayis I have not been the same. Like emotionally, I do actually feel better but it's tricky... i have always been an emotional sensitive person (relatively not regularly) since my first mydayis dose of the 75.5868???? Idk.. I have. Not. Cried. One. Time. Since... get this, I just went through a break up and met my dad for the first time in 10 years ... didn't shed a tear and still haven't .. which is just not like me at all to be honest. Idk but in a way I feel ""zombie-ish"" often. Don't care about much. Unbothered, but slightly confused.....



But yeah, I hated it.

"9541","I know I definitely fit in the diagnostic criteria. What I question is what's the difference between ADHD and, for example, lack of discipline when growing up? My parents did a good job raising me in some ways and a pretty bad job in others. I never had discipline at home. What if it all is a combination of not being taught good habits + i don't know, internet addiction? What if me being messy and struggling with chores is just simply laziness (despite the fact that I hate mess and dirt and am ashamed of how my flat looks sometimes)? What if my procrastination is simply laziness; again? Uhhm, I don't know. I just feel like I'm using excuses.

And yes, this is exactly my fear. At first I was so, so excited I might finally be able to study, read, change careers. I was excited I could be the person I always wanred to be. And now I fear it won't last and will be taken away from me.     
I feel like all my life I was only able to do ""easy"" things. So I never had a problem when gaining knowledge how to be a make up artist (aaaages ago). But at the same time, even though I always valued my interests in history and politics higher; I could never really do anything about that, as that would require, hmm, reading. So even though I knew I WANTED so much to do it I just couldn't. I'd try and fail and wouldn't focus and get bored. Is that ADHD? Or laziness?

I would just always choose the easy way and instant pleasure. Same goes for my eating - I know this candy bar will make me feel bad and I know long term I will feel better in my body if I eat healthy food, and I just can't see it.

So yeah, despite me really wanting to be maybe journalist, or maybe a researcher or... whatever, I would never manage to actually do anything about that. Even though I find those things really important to me.","d8drs5f",2,1475601406,"2016-10-04 17:16:46"

"9546","My reaction would be to have your university psych sit down with your parents in a closed session (I.e. Without you), so that your doc can work through some of the issues your parents have. Further more you just need to be as assertive as possible with your parents about the fact that your old doctor is wrong. Ask for a referral from your university doctor to find a new one that is covered by your insurance. 

The bottom line is that if you can't trust your doctor, find a new one who you do trust. Further more, your doctor is breaking the law if they tell your parents stuff without your expressed permission. Once you find a doctor that works with you, and advocates for you, (which its sound like your university doctor does), then you bring your parents into the loop on an information level only. They do not call the shots, you are simply doing them a favor by keeping you informed. And if that doesn't work you just need to hope you can find a job where you get full insurance coverage.

Also, did you ever get clinical testing done, or were you diagnosed just by the doctor? When my brother and I were younger we had a whole battery of testing done, and it is very accurate (there was stuff that my brother's testing predicted that's showing up 15 years later). The best part about the testing is that its objective, so you can take it to any doctor in the country and they should say the same thing.

"9547","Well it really depends on a lot of factors like HW, Lifestyle, Social life, Discipline.  Don't use this list as an official diagnostic tool but heres what I think. (again its a case by case basis, so it will be different, I'm just going of off my own experience with ADHD)

From 1-4 (4 being the worst)

1.Mild ADHD - Plays with objects in hand while sitting still, but can pay attention for the most part, procrastinates on assignments but always turns them in on time.  Foresees consequences of actions (staying up late) and prevents them by being responsible.  Is not very forgetful, socially fits in.

2.Moderate ADHD - Is restless when sitting, always has to be playing with something, misses minor points in class lesson. Procrastinates on assignments and needs to stay up late in order to finish them on time. Socially fits in but sometimes blurts out answers/talks out of turn.

3.ADHD - Cant sit still, daydreams often.  Is forgetful of things.  Somewhat socially disruptive (talks out of turn, doesn't use inside voice, changes topics often).  Extremely difficult to do assigned HW or reading.

4.Severe ADHD - Will not sit at all, always running around, full of energy.  Is forgetful of things.  Socially disruptive. Somewhat emotional, has mild panic attacks.  Will not do HW at all.  Only does things that are interesting or stimulating.  Doesn't foresee long term consequences.  Has very little self discipline.

"9549","Check with your doctor first. I'm not a doctor so take my advice with a grain of salt :)

What I have found to relieve myself of anxiety, especially when meds start wearing off is: P-5-P (Vitamin B6) 50mg and 100mg of Taurine. P5P helps to convert the excitatory amino, glutamate, into the calming amino GABA. Of course benzos work by increasing GABA which calms the mind. However too much P5P (B6) can be toxic. So Caution! Amps do increase glutamic acid however, which is why there is that peculiar warning about not taking supplements with glutamates in the literature that comes with Amp based meds.

Taurine, in studies, shows that it increases GABA receptors in the brain. So when the P5P converts glutamates to GABA, having an increased amount of receptors, should theoretically help the GABA bind more easily, thus calming the brain.

Not sure my science is sound, but I did get anxiety from meds, and while not completely under control, I am able to push the anxiety aside now. It is much better. 

Again though these can be toxic at high levels so do research first or talk to a Dr. P5P can cause neuropathy at high levels and Taurine can screw with your vassopressin secretion, which can affect renal activity, blood pressure, sodium pump etc. If your doctor clears you to try it, may be a cheap way to help your anxiety.","c79iuk8",1,1354348226,"2012-12-01 07:50:26"

i think my therapist is specialized in ADHD all i know is that it is at a behavior clinic. i plan on talking about RSD and just my anxiety overall with education. i don’t know what to expect with therapy though so i don’t know if i’ll be talking about that.

i am really scared of failure because i have been able to maintain good stats and out-of-school activities so far, but i can feel myself deteriorating. i really want to go to a good college and i’m scared if i mess up in any tiny way that it will stop me from that (logically it doesn’t make sense but when i’m in the situation i can’t see that i’m not a complete failure). but again when i’m in this state i can’t consider any positives even if i have someone right by me telling them. i will still try this though if i feel like i’m starting to get upset about my academics.

idk my moms pretty closed minded and she’s always been a shouter. i try to not use her as an example so instead when i’m angry or confused i have a waterfall of tears gushing down my face. it’s been like this my whole life so i don’t think it’s ever gonna change.","fyfvzgd",1,1595054157,"2020-07-18 06:35:57"

I'll spare you all the details, but what finally helped was that I ended up going to a doctor (not a psych) that I already knew was treating a friend for depression and was easy to get an appointment with (as opposed to waiting weeks or months).  This doctor is actually an RN that works in a small office that is overseen by 1 actual doctor. He was able to give me quick screenings and recommend medications, almost too quickly, honestly, BUT, I was fine with that, because now I had access to meds I could try, and then basically I would deal with the effects or changes with my actual therapist (separate from this doctor). My therapist is just a social worker/counselor, not a psychiatrist, but that's good too because therapists tend to listen better and talk through your issues, whatever they may be, as opposed to just focusing the conversation on meds exclusively. It works for me to have them separate.

For now tell him that he should dose up on magnesium and zinc everday as this will prevent tolerance, it will slow down the addiction, I don't really see any good coming from just snitching on him, and if you did go to the police would that really be looking out for his best interests? If I were using drugs and I knew what I was doing with research and then some idiot told on me I wouldn't be happy, it's a personal choice also you have to remember.

I live in Alberta and while it did take me 6 months to get in for my initial appointment with the psychiatrist, I didn't have to pay a cent out of pocket for his time. They are covered by Alberta Health like any other medical Dr. We just have long wait times because there aren't enough of them. 

I had six appointments with him all told, including a couple follow ups when we were tweaking my meds and then he discharged me back to my GP for getting my prescriptions renewed going forward. 

That said, I probably would never have ended up seeing a psychiatrist at all if I hadn't first gone to a psychologist, which isn't covered by AHS (there are lots of places with sliding scale fees or ever covered care for those who can't afford it but they tend to have long wait times). 

I am fortunate to have really good extended health coverage through work, which covers $800 a year per service for things like psychologists/MSWs, massage, chiro, physio, acupuncture, naturopaths, etc. Because I have that coverage I was able to choose a psychologist for myself that was both conveniently located and highly rated. And she is fucking AWESOME.

While I have seen others who didn't have ADHD take the same Adderall and basically not be able to sleep for pretty much the entire night and well into the next day. I mean if that alone isn't proof there isn't something very different going on, I don't know what is. 

It's actually what convinced my wife to really believe me, when her and I went to a dr managed weight loss deal and got Adipex, She'd be like a squirrel on speed and I'd be the exact opposite. It's funny the next checkup she asked the doctor why it affected us so differently and the doctor looked at me and said ""ADHD am I right?"" And I just nodded. At that point he explained the whole paradoxical effect stimulants tend to have. After that she told me all that the entire time she thought I was just full of it when I'd blame something on ADHD.

"9615","Hi, I relate to your story. I first spoke to a counsellor at uni, back in 1997 about stress and anxiety. At the time I attributed most of it, so did those around me, to the external factors in my life. So after a history of 20years of periods of stress and anxiety, I finally got a diagnosis. ADHD-C fits why I find so many of these external factors stressful and have a hard time resting to de-stress. So after many years of talking to therapists, I’ve also found that they tend to follow a process or thought pattern, which is also human nature. An observation is made, a hypothesis is formed, then a dicusssion/debate ensues to prove or disprove that hypothesis. Now, if you go into a professionals office, and say, “here’s my hypothesis, please help me confirm it” that professional may tend to think, let’s see, I’m the educated one in this subject, I must be right..... so here’s my hypothesis..... 
I’ve experienced this with GPs, car mechanics, clients..... educated humans love a good debate!!

On a personal note, going through such a lengthy period of therapists, on and off, not continuously, then finally getting a structured assessment and diagnosis was a huge relief. Like spending days shopping for a suit, and being on the verge of giving up. Then finding that one suit that’s a perfect fit. That feels like, “oh yeah, that’s the one!! Where have you been hiding.....!?”

"9621","Will do. 

I might be hard to tell, I think. For example, while taking Concerta definitely helps my ADHD, it’s hard to honestly and accurately identify a clear concrete example or even feeling ( aside from the time I first took it). Yet I know if I were to stop taking it, or miss a day/dose, I know absolutely how much less functional ( and more “adhd”) I’d be. 

With Guanfacine/Intuniv, the little I’ve read suggests that any positive effect will only take place in 2, 3 or 4 weeks time. And, I’m guessing the 1 mg daily dose is a very conservatively low one ( which is likely to be increased). 

Since I last posted, although it could very well be placebo (side) effect, I suspect that although I’m taking it at night as prescribed, intuniv is responsible for the increased sleepiness I’ve been experiencing in the mornings. I’m very certain that it is the reason my sleep has now been disrupted with me waking at 0330 ( previously I’d sleep straight through the night and usually wake up at 0500 or 0530). 

If Intuniv somehow does what my physician hopes - enhance or compliment the effectiveness of my daily maxed-out Concerta dose, then as long as the side effects aren’t too overwhelming, I’ll be happy.","euczp1i",1,1563693774,"2019-07-21 07:22:54"

The most that would be likely to change at school or university is that they could start offering you accommodations to make your school experience with adhd easier, like offering you extended time on an exam. This would be for the purpose of helping you so if you don’t want it you should be able to refuse, and ive never heard of accommodations going on someone’s school record or anything.

"9689","Hey - I'm the same: without any external structure I can't get things done. Imposing structure on yourself can help, but it sounds like you've tried that and you're not in a place right now where you can make that work, because you've got too much to stay on top of.

First key thing is to get a handle on how overwhelmed you're feeling:

* Do you have any commitments you can cut without drastic consequences? Cut them right now.
* If you've not already spoken with them, go see your university support services to see how they might be able to help/advise you. Way better to do it *before* you reach the point you're ready to drop out.
* Similarly, if you've got assignments/exams coming up, contact your tutor and explain how you're struggling: they're often willing to give an extension. They don't want to see you fail any more than you do.
* Worrying about debt is going to be a massive source of stress and distraction for you, so if you feel like you're getting it under control then it'll provide you relief with everything else you're trying to do. I'm guessing you're in the UK if you're on Xaggitin, so [https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/loans/debt-help-plan/](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/loans/debt-help-plan/) is a great place to start for UK-specific advice. There might also be some useful pointers for you in that site's guide to mental health and debt: [https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/mental-health-guide/](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/mental-health-guide/).
* It's hard to know exactly what to say about your family situation without more info, but if there's anyone you can reach out to for help (or even just to vent &amp; get things off your chest), please do.

I know some of the above are going to be difficult things in themselves to motivate yourself to do, but I promise you will feel so much relief if *any* of them work out.

In terms of being able to get stuck into your studying:

* If telling yourself you're going to study for 4 hours doesn't work, maybe you're setting yourself too big a target to be able to motivate yourself for. Tell yourself you're going to study for 30 minutes then take a break. If you succeed with that, do it again.
* Do you have someone you can buddy up with, to study with you or just check in on you to keep you accountable?
* Can you go somewhere else (e.g. a library) where your potential distractions will be fewer?

Lastly, it may be that these meds (or the dose you're on) are not the ones for you. Speak to your doctor when you can to see if there's anything they'd advise changing.","fdn9hmj",1,1578580836,"2020-01-09 14:40:36"

Is there anything you like to draw in particular? I went through a phase where I was really into Kingdom Hearts and would draw the characters. Something I struggled with was finishing a drawing or completing the background. I would lose interest.

I'd say still *try* to come at it like someone who has found ways to improve themselves and has advice. Just causally saying hey, you know when I forget simple things, it helps me to do x,y,z. Advice coming from other ADHD people is often more meaningful than advice from da ~normies~ because ""just write yourself a note!"" ""keep a schedule!"" might be a moot point for someone who would have trouble remembering *those* things. And if he doesn't accept it...that may be his issue. One thing I've learned about dealing with mental illness over the years is that you *have* to be an active agent in your own recovery. No one can force you into it.

As an update, I talked to my father today.  He told me that I don't have ADHD because people who have ADHD are nothing like me.  I told him he's not a doctor but he started telling me that just because I read some symptoms on the internet doesn't mean I have ADHD.  He says he does it all the time with different diseases.  Basically he thinks I'm suffering from some hypochondria.  He thinks I've convinced myself and will convince a doctor that I have ADHD. We had a talk about my prospects and he started going into ""Lets be honest, you didn't apply yourself in highschool.  There was a lot of reasons, I know, but even you have to admit that some of it was laziness, distractions, and the fact that you didn't like school.""   So fuck him.  I'm so done with his ignorance and his arrogance.

I'm not going to see a doctor immediately, because I'm a bit of an emotional mess right now, but in the near future once I settle a bit I want to handle this.  I just have some questions.  I know that there is doctor and patient confidentiality, but I'm on my dad's insurance plan.  What does that mean for me?  I rarely ever see the doctor, so the whole process is really a mystery to me.  The doctor we go to knows my family well, but I've only seen him once or twice.  If I tell him I want some privacy he will oblige?

ADHD is learning to do everything very systematically and it feels robotic but SHIT GETS DONE FINALLY WOOHOO!    
ADHD is becoming really good at studying methods that have you write material down very clearly, short, practical and efficient so that you can read and re-read 300 times because your short term memory can't be trusted.   
ADHD is learning that if you don't write it down you will probably forget it. Write it the fuck down. Do it.  
ADHD is putting everything in the same spot OR ELSE.  
ADHD is checking stove and door before you leave. You have left on the stove once or twice and didn't lock the door at some point, never again!  
ADHD is 'uuuhm uhhm I wrote it down somewhere, gimme a second'.   
ADHD is either looking like you're paying attention or actually paying attention, almost never both at the same time. :D  
ADHD is building habits to get around your symptoms and whoa it works... weird, nothing really used to work. Awesome!  
ADHD is hating your medication but having to admit that it helps a lot.   
ADHD is being late about 50% of the time for some fucking reason. But hey, it used to be 90%.   
ADHD is seeing other people with ADHD succeed (Degrees, Master's, Doctorates, Really Cool Artwork, Gamedesigners, Writers, etc) and feeling more hopeful because of it!

"9768","Self advocating for your health is a lot different than self diagnosing. Just saying if you self diagnose you still do not have a diagnosis, the only one who is able to diagnose an illness or disorder is a medical doctor. 
I've done a great deal of self advocating for my health. I also tend to become somewhat of a self learned expert on any medication or treatment I've ever been on. I think it's highly important you are very well informed about your condition. Expectations, options, alternatives and so on. But first you really need a medical doctor to properly diagnose your condition. 

I never said that doctors were infaliable either. Been down that road a few times with several family members. Since we are talking about conditions that require treatments and the only way to get treatment is to go to a doctor. Even if the doctor is wrong in the beginning you are one step closer to getting where you should be. There are almost 0 conditions out there that you get a diagnosis take this pill and you never have to worry about it again. Once diagnosed you are likely stuck with multiple doctors visits per year with medication changes frequently until the right dose is found. Gosh it took me ages to find the right dose of thyroid medication before I didnt feel like I was walking through wet sand up to my hips everyday from fatigue. That wasn't even a guessing game to find out if I had the condition either. I had half my thyroid removed. But dosing thyroid medication is a long and tedious process with bloodwood 3 months to check levels, because you cant just take a week or 2 of the medication to see if it's working. You have to take 6-8 weeks for it to show up in lab work adjust the medication and wait another 3 months. 

OP should really start with a good physical with their GP.  There are a large number of other medical issues that could also cause the symptoms OP listed. Thyroid disorder, diabetes or even prediabetic, and that's just a start. It's best to rule out any medical issues first anyway as it would make treatment much easier. 

As far as access to health care. I'm well aware how difficult it can be. I assume because OP has access to the internet they live in at least a developed country with at least some resources for those less fortunate. Your health is the most important thing in your life. Without it all else is irrelevant. I mean if I dont take care if both my body and my mind what good am I to my family? I wouldn't be able to care for them, work and provide the life we have and I would become a burden to them. It's also about quality of life as well. 

Dont assume that just because someone isnt jumping up to make an appointment tomorrow it's because they dont have the means or resources available to them. There are tons of resources for those who dont have insurance such as state funded health clinics. While I will agree that wouldn't be my first choice either. It's better than 0 choices at all. I've actually taken my son to a state clinic for depression therapy when he was suicidal. They were the most compassionate people I've ever met.

1) Your intentions were genuinely good, you don't need to doubt yourself there.

2) Delivering constructive criticism that someone will actually happily accept is a really advanced art that most people don't know. Let me give you two keys that can help you master that art:

a) Establish your love and respect first. The person needs to have no doubt that you genuinely care for their well-being.

b) Start with ""your right,...."" Find any general, vague idea that you can agree with then add ""....and"" here's more information to add to what you're right about. (this is where you put in your argument.

Problem was I never understood why it wasn’t helping me my whole work day. I work almost 12 hours... vyvanse lasts me 6, but I’m also on levothyroxin which might effect it some. Adderall was great except we just kept upping the dose to get it to last longer.

The answer is to add a dose, not up the dose. 2 doses of adderall ir will not last 12 hours no matter how hard you try. 3 does.... 

So vyvanse was the same way and we got to 60mg. I was crashing around 1 and still had 3-4 hours of work left. I just sat in my car for an hour.

Tried Ritalin/concerta. Just depressed when it wore off and always tired. Went from February to last month on it and struggled with my psych “these meds don’t effect your mood! They are effect immediately and then gone.”

So back to vyvanse and hey depression feeling gone. Still not satisfied with length so we are now trying mydayis.

I'm in Canada. My really nasty mocking GP that I'm currently stuck with told me that I cannot increase the dose of my adderall or Modafinil, as both are stimulants. Currently on high dose Modafinil and low dose Adderall. The adderall was helping but stopped working so now I can't get anything done on top of severe chronic fatigue which I need Modafinil (less than 300mg doesn't work at all), so he said we can't go any higher, so now I am completely devestated because I cannot live like this, I am so fucking sleepy all day, yawning constantly, and now because he won't let me increase my Adderall, I'm literally thrashing around in bed half the day and incapacitated as my ADHD makes it so sitting still is unbearable. Good god I'm not sure if he should be THAT cautious or was just protecting his license. I don't want to risk my health ofcourse, but I also cannot live in this much misery. Sorry for ranting just having a mental breakdown #100,000,000 this past week.

"9796","As the others have mentioned, ADHD is not a learning disability. Its never a learning disability. Sure, some of us struggle to pay attention, to study, to stay on task, to be on time, or to maintain any working memory at all, but this is due to ADHD being an executive function disorder. 

A neurotypical persons frontal cortex matures and can perform more efficiently some complex functions to:

&gt;1. Analyze a task
&gt;2. Plan how to address the task
&gt;3. Organize the steps needed to carry out the task
&gt;4. Develop timelines for completing the task
&gt;5. Adjust or shift the steps, if needed, to complete the task
&gt;6. Complete the task in a timely way

“Executive dysfunction is a brain-based impairment that causes problems with analyzing, planning, organizing, scheduling, and completing tasks at all — or on deadline. The seven major types of self-regulation associated with executive function are as follows:

&gt;1. Self-Awareness: commanding self-directed attention
&gt;2. Self-Restraint: inhibiting yourself
&gt;3. Non-Verbal Working Memory: holding things in your mind to guide behavior
&gt;4. Verbal Working Memory: retaining internal speech
&gt;5. Emotional: using words and images along with self-awareness to alter how you feel about things
&gt;6. Self-Motivation: motivating yourself to do things when no outside consequences exist
&gt;7. Planning and Problem Solving: finding new approaches and solutions”

The quote OP gave pretty clearly describes points 1, 3, 6, and 7. I graduated high school with my lowest grade being a single B+, but I still struggle to sit down and take a test without all the information disappearing from my brain the moment I need it. Not knowing where to start and getting myself turned around jumping through multiple trains of thought *is* a symptom of my ADHD. 

*This may not be true for everyone, but it’s best not to invalidate everyone’s experiences based on a single limited view. *

Time    |               Job Description              | $ Earned  
--------|----------------------------------------|----------

It probably won't take her 4 minutes. Probably a minute and a half. But, I will pay her .60 cents anyway. I see your point, though. Frankly, the thing I am most concerned about with her is exemplified by the ""perfect is the enemy of done"" manifesto. I would rather see her do SOMETHING - even if it is half assed, and it be DONE, than do one perfect thing for hours and hours, or stress over it having to be perfect and then not start. I think I need to note this.     

I agree with you 100% about the chores=wasted time association thing. I had a HORRIBLE association with chores as a kid - probably why I hate doing them so much now!

"9834","Things that have helped me when I have to work on a computer: 

1. Keep a notepad on your desk for writing down stray thoughts.  It really does help.  Put the notepad under something so you can't see it when it's not in use.  Want to know Marie Antoinette's shoe size?  Share the thought with Mr. Legal Pad, not Lady Google. 
2. Keep a separate page open (minimized) with your background music (I use ambient forest noises or whatnot on youtube).  Nothing else is to be on this window except my music selections.  Makes it super easy to find and change channels when I get bored with elks shrieking like cats in heat and want to listen to crows arguing with rain. 
3. Timer.  Get one and use it to give yourself five min to ADD all over a subject of interest.  When that timer goes off murder those tabs like they slapped your dog.  Walk around for a second crowing like you just avenged Fido from a ruffian and then sit back down to your work.
4. I am only allowed to have a certain number of no-work-related tabs open (four total) before I just start bookmarking them into a folder on my desktop literally called ""ADD Squirelspot"".  The fact that I can retrieve those pages at a moment's notice helps my anxiety that I may be throwing away some information that I will inevitably need later. 
5. Become a ruthless, bloodied savage of a tab closer.  Every tab you close is another vote that Trump loses to Biden in the recounts.  Or one-eyed kitten that finds a home.  
6. No third window open.  Ever.
7. Beer.  Am not kidding.  For me, sipping enough to maintain just the barest trace of a buzz helps me focus.  The reason for this is that my brain is spaztic and beer is a natural depressant: the alcohol evens me out some.  Because it's a depressant it also makes it harder for me to ""find joy"" in jumping from one subject to another looking for that high you get when you land on something really interesting.  Thankfully I don't have to do this very often (tax season, yikes!) so once or twice (Oh, yeah, comparing Black Friday deals, what a nightmare!) a year really ain't breaking my bank or my liver.  For homework or age purposes, beer may not be doable.  If it's bad enough that it's literally 50 tabs you can try medication which will lessen the ""high"" you get from following your ADD across the web and into the stars.
8. A cat in your lap.  For me, this was a breakthrough.  I found that my focus wanted to split anyway so if I let myself have my 5 minutes every 20 min or so, and then was always just giving passive love and cuddles to the cat then this was enough split focus for me to actually dedicate one of my mental whiteboards to the major task.

Hope even some of this helps.  It took a while for me to get the discipline to smash tabs closed as fast as they managed to multiply.  Finding out what your distractions are and limiting them helps.  I had to take the ""rabbithole"" subreddits off of my reddit and only do the ones which I know I can answer a post or two and then move on.  I also make myself check facebook and emails while I'm still in my work clothes, not allowing myself to take them off till I shut both programs down.  I hate my work clothes so I found out in about three days how much stuff on Facebook I thought I was never going to be able to just fly past are now things that don't grab my attention at all anymore.","ge646ms",1,1606759378,"2020-11-30 18:02:58"

I am a wife with inattentive ADHD. I know just what your wife means by survival mode. My whole life is like that! My husband basically runs the organizational part of our lives. I'm great at meeting everyone's minute-to-minute needs/wants and taking on fantasy projects that he would never get to (which he then has to get on my case to finish.... but that's another story) but things like making grocery lists? He has to tell me every step of the way. 

Example: we've run out of yogurt. It's my job to put it on next week's list. My husband will tell me once while looking at the fridge, ""hey put yogurt on the grocery list"". He'll probably remind me again before he leaves for work. And then he'll also often put it in these emails he sends me with my to-do list. Seriously, this is what it takes.

It is tedious for him but this way, things get DONE at least on a semi reliable basis. Example of a to-do list email:

1. Call plumber for upstairs toilet leak and kitchen sink drain

2. Return lib books X, Y, and Z

3. Pay karate fees

4. Put yogurt on grocery list


As you can see this isn't EVERYTHING I need to do that day. I still manage two small kids and their schoolwork, activities, supervising playtime, etc. I still have cooking and laundry and dishes and chores. I still have my writing to do every morning.

Anyway. Just wanted to let you see the level of support I get from my husband to get basic everyday shit done. 

And FYI I procrastinated for years on getting my diagnosis, and after getting it 4 months ago I am currently procrastinating on calling the therapist. So, I mean, it's not like I am functional. My husband leaves me alone to deal with my personal shit, though, I won't be getting reminders from him to call therapists.... I like the space he gives me here.

"9859","Not OP, but I just finally got tested myself and the pandemic was the final straw. My symptoms have absolutely spiraled out of control since social isolation started and I just am not functioning at all anymore (starting therapy next week but with high risk people in the house, it’s going to be a while before I can explore medication as an option). 

I questioned myself a lot because my brother has ADHD and was diagnosed in early elementary school. I kept telling myself that if I had ADHD, my parents would have gotten me tested much earlier. My mom told me maybe a year or two ago that they always suspected I have it, but that I coped “well enough” (and by that, I wasn’t biting and hitting people the way my brother used to). At that point, I figured I was too old for a diagnosis to matter. 

At the start of the pandemic, I noticed people with an ADHD diagnosis posting more about their experiences on social media and I was almost in tears to finally find people whose experiences I could relate to. I don’t want to say my symptoms used to be minor, but having a routine kept me enough in check that I could convince myself that I’m just lazy and have a bad memory. Losing my job and not being able to go anywhere has sent me into a spiral where I can no longer avoid the truth that my brain just works differently than others.

"9866","In the classic movie *Lawrence of Arabia*, there is this scene where the Lawrence puts out a lit match with his fingers without licking them and then goes on like nothing happened. A fellow officer sees this, and tries it, burning his fingers which he proceeds to suck his poor fingers and says ""That hurts!"" Lawrence replies ""Of course it hurts!"" ""What's the trick then?"" ""The trick, is not to mind that it hurts.""

Dealing with ADHD manifestations is like this. We have to learn, for our own peace of mind, not to mind screwing up, making mistakes, missing deadlines, sticking our foot in our mouth, flunking, etc, etc, etc, while at the same time doing our best not to let any of it happen in the future. 

Two things that helped me develop this attitude was 1. Studying and practicing clowning (where you go out of your way to screw up spectacularly so everyone will laugh at you) and 2. meditation. But anything that helps you not take yourself so seriously will help.

Not minding mistakes, is much better than never making them, because you **will** make them. *Everyone* makes them. But when you don't hold on and recriminate yourself for the old ones, it is much easier to bounce back up and try again with everything you have.  ","d88mul7",5,1475260950,"2016-09-30 18:42:30"

The anger, mainly in the mixed episodes, is 'borderline' dangerous because  I have done some ridiculously stupid things e.g. punch walls, knock holes in doors, make violent threats, self-harm, etc.. 

However, this is not always the case with stimulants. Currently I am on Ritalin, and I feel a tad anxious, but I am also super-stressed. These fits of anger always occur in stressful times and are basically randomly triggered and take an a long amount of time for me to calm down. I am hesitant about starting any BP meds because much unlike they ADHD meds, they actually cause 'brain-fog' and significantly more horrible, physical symptoms.

I've really, really benefited from the therapy - CBT has been amazing for me, and it's helped me to control the feelings of anxiety that I get, often associated to the symptoms of my ADHD - mainly fear related to my inability to concentrate at work, especially as I am moving up into senior leadership of a very large firm.

"9929","Not a parent, but I grew up with undiagnosed ADHD and was finally diagnosed last year.

First– this feels such like a small thing (and you may have already done so), but make sure you tell him he has ADHD, whenever it's an appropriate/relevant conversation to have. Even if they can't quite put a finger on it, kids can tell if something's up, and it's really hard to be struggling without knowing why. When I was little it felt like I kept running into an invisible wall over and over, but now that I'm aware of my ADHD and can see that wall, it's easier to create strategies to get around it.

In terms of school or homework, everyone with ADHD is different, so as he gets older I would try to observe what sorts of things work for him and what doesn't, and then try to support that as best as you can. (For example, some people need to work in a quiet space, while others can't focus without background noise; some people need frequent breaks, but others will lose their concentration if they pause.) This also applies to stuff like keeping track of tasks, time management, etc. You might have to try different strategies before finding ones that click with him.

In general, having stuff written down helps me a lot. My parents used to write out reminders for me because I'd forget verbal instructions/information very easily. Breaking down tasks into smaller, more specific steps (""put pajamas on --&gt; take vitamin --&gt; brush teeth"" vs. ""get ready for bed"") can help a lot with executive dysfunction. If there's more ""boring"" stuff to do, like chores, I like turning them into little games for myself.

Also– don't shy away from trying medication if your son's doctor eventually thinks it could be a good option for him. It doesn't work for everybody, but if it does, it can make a *huge* difference. It was like night and day for me. If you do go down that path, just make sure to listen to your son about how it makes him feel, since side effects can vary and each medication can work differently for different people.

I hope some of that helped! :)","fznqtz8",2,1596055666,"2020-07-29 20:47:46"
"9930","I feel so frustrated for you because i’ve gone through exactly what you’re going through right now. 
A couple years ago I finally got the courage to go get back on medication and the doctor prescribed me antidepressants... 
For some reason a lot of doctors (at least the ones I’ve gone to) don’t understand That our depression and anxiety stem from our ADHD.
I think you need to find a different doctor or go back and make sure you get adhd medication and find out what dosage to take. 
I recently got back on medication (Concerta) and I was worried about my doctors appointment because I didn’t want them to try to suggest antidepressants again. But I learned that I have to be more assertive in my doctor appointments. You need to go in and be more assertive of what you’re wanting because at least in America we pay way too much money to be fucking around with different appointments to not be getting the treatment we need.

So before putting these tips into practice, eat a balanced diet, work out for half an hour every morning you're able to (I was only able to do that cuz my sister was dragging me to the gym every day, so get a buddy to exercise with you if you need to), and get enough sleep!

"9947","Ways to reform the system.

* Ban gifts such as food.

* Require your drug reps to pass a certification exam like barbers have to do.  These people should have at least a BS and not a political science degree.

* Expand health care privacy laws.  CVS should not be able to share confidential information like did this doctor prescribe a drug to patient x, without you signing a waiver.  The only reason this should be legal is if you want to encourage corruption.

* Federally funded drug comparison trials.  This can help save medicare money but also prevent BS from reps.

* Federally funded drug education posted on YouTube and the creation of treatment guides.  An independent source details each med and the doctors now have a new source for info.

Now all of these beside the last one are being implemented by the states or the feds in the last ten years.  These efforts need to be expanded and empathissed.","cogv1za",1,1423553625,"2015-02-10 07:33:45"

Something like Reddit or social media may be less rewarding overall than other more fulfilling tasks, but there’s almost zero effort to just refresh a page. It’s zero effort plus instant tiny reward versus some amount of effort and a bigger reward. 

I’m like this for things like movies and video games. At this point, I’m so spoiled by streaming video that despite having a huge Blu-Ray collection, even if I kind of want to watch something, I’m more inclined to just stay on Reddit/social media or watch something that’s on Netflix because it’s less effort than grabbing the Blu-Ray, taking it out of the case, and navigating menus.

But initially for most things, there’s a learning curve and you have to push through that stage before you gain competence and start to derive a lot of reward from it. If the activity itself isn’t intrinsically rewarding to begin with, this early stage is made easier when an extrinsic reward provides incentive to push through the early stages. For example, if you had a major health scare in the family or you really want to impress the opposite sex, that will make the early stages of an exercise routine a lot easier to put up with. So keep in mind that for a lot of things, you have to put in some straight up willpower and exercise patience until it becomes rewarding enough that it’s easy. 

One way around this is to decrease activation energy for desired activities and increase activation energy for less desirable activities. For, say, practicing guitar, you can keep your guitar next to where you are always sitting so you can easily pick it up and play it a bit now and then. For the gym, you can set your gym clothes and shoes out before bed so it’s easy to get changed the next morning. For dieting, you can make it harder to eat junk food by simply not keeping it in the house, while keeping healthier snacks, so it’s less effort to snack on something healthy than it is to go to the store. You can also use apps like Focus or Self-Control (both on Mac, the latter is free) to block your favorite websites for certain amounts of time. ","e5egwjv",1,1536099589,"2018-09-04 22:19:49"
"9996","Listen man, a good amount of us here were ""officially"" diagnosed with ADHD as adults. I was also INITALLY diagnosed with ADHD as a child and like you, my parents made the decision to skip medication. Their reasoning may or may not have been the same as your mothers but to even jokingly suggest that is some pretty dark shit dude. Like another user said, if you would've been medicated as a child, chances are you wouldn't been the man you are today. 
&amp;nbsp;

That being said, I understand where your coming from. I get that you are frustrated. I get that you want someone to blame. But I'll tell you right now.... medication is not some silver bullet. Does it help me? Yes. Will it help you? I don't know. And the only way that you'll find out is by talking with your doctor and learning based on how your body reacts. ADHD meds are not going to fix everything, nor would they have fixed everything if you had been prescribed to them as a child. Medication WILL also come with its fair share of side effects that you may or may not be willing to accept.
&amp;nbsp;

I hope you get things figured out and you find out the best solution for yourself. Regular exercise and a healthy diet really helps (as cliche as it may sound). Good luck.","crz3ens",9,1433734619,"2015-06-08 03:36:59"
"9997","Hahaha LOL.

Honestly I think you are in USA because the reddit demographics but you still have not been in your clinical years. In your clinical years,you will see that at least 1 in 7-8 MDs you work together are in the spectrum of ADHD. It is actually a really fitting job for us if you think,you have to be reactive,you really should be multitasking and you should not.focus on one thing constantly.","gltjaft",1,1612322961,"2021-02-03 03:29:21"
"9998","So they can be connected to OCD, but dermatillomania and trichotillomania are standalone conditions too. I'm super lucky to have ADHD, OCD and dermatillomania although my psych thinks the skin picking is actually more connected to my anxiety than my OCD. Either way, the best thing is to try keep all things under control through a mixture of medication/behavioural treatments as they can all trigger each other. 

I wouldn't worry too much about having OCD if your only symptoms are the skin picking and hair pulling,  but obviously I don't know what else you might be dealing with.","g9scuz1",3,1603480234,"2020-10-23 19:10:34"
