"43","I was on Adderall and Ritalin and many hosts of other drugs in the 90s when they were first really starting to prescribe them I found Adderall XR to be the best for me. I took them from 3rd grade to like 9-11th grade done remember. But they worked they did change me some socially and mentally I thought I'd stop taking them since I was an adult and I knew what's best for me. But after watching Dr Russell Barkley about ADHD and knowing how   my brain is not properly formed having a reduction in dopamine and norepinephrine receptors in the brain. To learning people with ADHD have a 20-30% in lag in the brain ect.... Knowing these things I have started again on there path of managing ADHD because there is no cure for it you can manage it.  I've started Adderall XR again I've started taking citalophram for anxiety and depression when 50% of people with ADHD also have a second or third disorder usually anxiety then depression. Working day by day is a struggle and I hope that I can be able to use the knowledge that I have it's a challenge to use the habits you actually know. We as ADHD people don't have a knowledge problem we have a problem to actually use it.

Look up dr Russell Barkley and watch his lectures on YouTube you'll be fascinated by them and learn allot. If your family or friends don't understand you shows them those videos make them watch them.

"74","First, this is a difficult time. Avoid big decisions when you are feeling low.  
  
What is the daily work like for a financial planner in your context?  
I know somebody (probably not ADHD) who calls herself that, but I'm not sure it is the same kind of work. She owns a branch office of a large company. Her day consists mostly of meeting with clients. The lack of structure is not healthy for her.  
  
My suggestion (do this when you are in at least a neutral mood, not when your self esteem is low) is to picture yourself doing the work. Picture it concretely - where are you, what do you see, hear, smell? What is your daily routine - do you commute to an office in a strict schedule, visit clients, do deep analysis, read lots of information off a screen? The point is, look at it in a very specific and sensory way. Obviously you don't know the actual details, but imagine plausible examples as an experience, not as an idea.  
This work you have imagined, does it feel good? Does it fill you with dread*? Does it fit who you are? Does it provide the structure or freedom or challenges you need to thrive and be happy? 
  
If I'm not happy and challenged, my work output stinks no matter how hard I try, so this kind of reflection isn't optional for me.  It isn't being picky about work, it's making sure I can bring real value to the transaction. Fortunately for me, I'm good at finding happiness and challenge even where it isn't obvious. 
  
Are you somebody who needs a strict schedule to keep yourself organized? Does this work provide that?  
  
Just some things to consider. What I'm getting at: think/feel specific, sensory, experiential things about the work. 
  
Again, don't try this when you are down.  
  
  
* the dread thing: my girlfriend told me that ""does the thought of going into this place every day fill you with dread?"" is a good question to ask yourself at a job interview, and that ""yes"" is a good enough reason to decline the offer. At my next interview, I asked myself that, and answered ""yes"". It felt really good to have a decision for the offer, to have it be my decision. I didn't get the offer, but still...

You can ask your psych next time you visit about it. They should be able to go along with it for the month and see if it works.

On the flipside, Nomie has been great. It doesn't try to be a game, and it doesn't have a to-do list built into it. It's a habit tracker with a super-simple interface, where the interaction costs are low enough that I can track things on a granular level without making life difficult.

The difference, I think, is how the two apps tackle the consistency barrier. Habitica tries to make consistency more enjoyable (and inconsistency less enjoyable), while Nomie tries to make paying attention easier (and the data derived from that attention more useful).

Ultimately, UX is UX. Habitica is a bit too niche to fit a diverse set of usage styles.","dl4ct0m",4,1501784536,"2017-08-03 18:22:16"

"90","Be careful with relying on hyperfocus to achieve your goals; it's hard to control, so it's hard to harness. I suggest that you try instead of build up habits of doing what you want to do and reducing activities that don't bring you closer to achieving your goals.

I have had some luck with ""opportunistic"" goal-achieving. That is, I make a list of everything that I want to get done in a day, and I note which ones I will do when I only have a few minutes of unstructured time. For instance, if I want to focus on stretching my body because I'm stiff, I have a prompt on my phone so that, whenever I have a moment to get bored and check my phone, I see if it's a good time to stretch.

I don't see why that wouldn't work with writing. Use your note-taking feature on your phone (I like Google Keep), and every time you find yourself checking your phone, see if you have a moment to jot down an idea of phrase that interests you. If you think of it often enough, you may be able to use a long stretch of time to really focus on your writing.

"92","If you are on stimulants, set two alarms: Your ""real"" alarm for when you need/want to wake up, and one 45 minutes earlier to take your meds. When your real alarm goes off it'll be way easier to get out of bed, and you'll already be on your focus game. It helped me a lot when I had the same problem (no classes till 1 in college).

If you're not on meds, try some non-traditional alarm apps. My favorite is Morning Routine: it lets you set up a cascade of alarms, each one dismissed by scanning a barcode. For example, my first alarm had me scan my bottle of meds (so I would take them), then there was a 30 minute break, and the next alarm had my scan my toothpaste, then a three minute break, then I had to scan my box of tea (which is upstairs, so I'm woken up even more), etc.

I personally have not found anything that is yet on the market that really has helped for more than a paragraph at a time. I find that on the computer, if I can zoom in, I tend to keep better track of what I'm reading, and if I lose my spot, I know it's somewhere on the screen. I also am *really* hoping/impatiently waiting for [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) to become more available, since that has been the first thing to give me legitimate hope.

"98","Instead of your project being “clean/organize the apartment” start smaller. Just clean and organize one drawer today. Tomorrow, do another drawer. Break it down into smaller easier pieces. If it’s a bigger job, like a closet, set a date and make a list of the bins/supplies you’ll need - make it a project. Pick out the music or podcasts you’ll listen to. Set a date in your calendar and block out time to plan for it and to do it. But work up to that by getting a few successes with smaller projects first to build your confidence and get your motivation going. Once you get a few little things done and it feels good- activates those reward centers in your brain- it’ll be easier to tackle a bigger project. But “cleaning the whole apartment” is such a big and overwhelming task for most people. Just do your junk drawer or your sock drawer today. Tomorrow set aside an hour or so to go through your old t-shirts. Make a laundry basket for give away stuff and bring a trash can in for throw away stuff. When you’re done immediately take your giveaway stuff to one of those drop off bins or to the goodwill. Then grab a Frappuccino or some other small treat to reward yourself on the way home. No treat until the job is done.

"99","What is your dosage on Vyvanse and what was your titration like? I am no doctor and obviously can't diagnose you but some of the things you've said sound like symptoms of over-medication. 

Stimulants can be really tricky to titrate right, because a lot of people will keep upping their dose because the way the medication ""feels"" changes, and not all doctors are good at guiding you through this properly. 

In short: The effect you're looking for from Vyvanse is better functioning, but you initially also may feel happier and better better about your life, because your dopamine levels have gone up. Then when that feeling fades because you get used to those dopamine levels, you think the meds aren't working anymore so you up the dose. It's a great recipe to end up on too high a dose! 

Side effects of too high dose include many of the things you mentioned. I would speak to my doctor if I were in your position, and see if you can try different dosages. It's also possible other meds could work better for you.","ebcn1x5",1,1544269974,"2018-12-08 11:52:54"

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

&amp;#x200B;

The key discussion point here is 'coping mechanisms'. Depending on the individual's ability to put them into place and use them, can mean the reason why outsiders don't recognise the struggles that are actually going on.  


Another point is that a DISORDER is not a disorder until it impacts an individual's life, AND how much it impacts can change over time, dependant on everything else going on. The university example is a HUGE trigger for a lot of people, other triggers are when people go into the whole 'get married, have kids, have job, have wife/husband' stage, once the kids are putting more demands and pressure on an individual, the wife/husband the adds more demands on top of that too, etc. etc. etc. it all gets too much.

Or you can think like ""you are allowed to do a whole day of planning at the end of the week if you manage to do X hours of work"".

"156","I recently read Worry-Free Money by Shannon Lee Simmons and she approaches saving/spending in a simpler way than most people.   
She kinda explains the uselessness of budgeting every dollar and calculating expenses for every month.   
She approaches it where you take your paycheque, put aside your fixed expenses (rent, insurance, etc), and your savings, then what is left is your spending money for that period - groceries, eating out, entertainment, etc.   
This way you have a ""hard limit"" of how much you can spend and you're not spending money you should be saving.   
I've tried it already for one week and I am already liking this way of thinking about money.   
I have $x to spend til pay day, and I can easily see in my chequing account what is left of that.   
Honestly she explains this in the first third of the book, you don't even need to read the whole thing.   


Also, having a ""Purchases"" list where things have to sit before you buy them helps a lot too. Often in that week or month you let it sit there you realize you don't need it, no longer want it or if you really do still want it, then you can feel better about purchasing it, because you've thought it out.

ANYWAY, this is my line on what I consider abuse: If you are causing physical damage to your body/mind (frying brain cells, destroying your nose from repeated use or because whatever you're snorting is caustic etc.), endangering yourself or others (e.g. driving impaired) or neglecting responsibility. Dosage escalation is considered part of physical damage...everything in moderation. For methylphenidate specifically I'd consider the recreational limit to be 80mg in a day if used very occasionally, or a smaller amount, say 30mg a few days a week. Insufflating methylphenidate boosts its bioavailability considerably, so I'd cut those values by 1/2 or so if that's the method of administration. Physical damage from methylphenidate is unlikely unless you have a preexisting condition. If it does occur, it will probably be a result of not eating or drinking enough.

At 32, I have a career track job, college education, a house in a cute neighborhood, and serve as a leader in a volunteer organization on the side. Getting here was really hard. 

I didn’t get diagnosed with ADHD until I was 29, i had spent my whole life feeing like a fuck up who wasted their potential. I failed out of college twice, but eventually graduated by the skin of my teeth. I kept managing to bounce around to office jobs that didn’t pay great, but they always had health insurance. I was very depressed at this time and could really only manage to go to work, feed my dog, and sleep. Everything else got ignored for a few years.

I kind of lucked into an engineering adjacent job about four years ago. I realized I liked the work. Once I got medicated, I realized I wanted to go back to school for engineering and my job is paying my tuition. School is so much easier for me now. I’m set to graduate next spring and I’m holding down a 3.9 GPA. Getting diagnosed made me realize I needed to be more intentional about how I managed myself because I realized that I had a real problem and wasn’t just a lazy, forgetful sack of shit. 

Holding myself to a schedule helps me so much to achieve the things that are absolutely necessary. I’ve pretty much given myself instructions on how to accomplish the bare minimum needed to be a functional adult. Also, utilizing reminders and calendars for everything and living by a schedule.  Since I’ve lived by this schedule for a while it’s gotten easier to keep my house clean, do my school work, and generally get less overwhelmed. 

I still don’t feel like I have my shit together. I’m so upset that I’m getting such a late start on my career. It feels like nearly everyone I know is so much more successful than me. However, I know that I am actually doing really well for myself.","fqjd1dz",1,1589408222,"2020-05-13 22:17:02"

"199","Adderall XR: Fantastic for me at least. It gets my ass moving and keeps me focused on the job at hand and keeps me from wandering off too far. Also seems to let me be able to put on some podcasts at work for white noise as I work and I'm not constantly shifting over to the podcast over work. That's huge because without the meds, I'd be shifting over a few times too many. I do get dry mouth from it. 

I also take Wellbutrin with it which counterbalances the other stuff. It helps with the depression and keeps me in check as well. The only downside is that occasionally, I can get a bout of sleep paralysis as I'm going to bed (that weird thing where your body goes to sleep before your mind does?) but it really also factors in on the kind of day I had. 

I did switch from Adderall to Vyvanse for a spell but while Vyvanse did keep me attentive, I got some severe headaches and had a few times when I woke up from sleeping with some wicked panic attacks. The headaches got to be too much so I switched back to Adderall. ","dc8c9be",1,1484025899,"2017-01-10 05:24:59"

"204","I have this problem. It has caused a lot of problems in my life. Not only do I have a lateness problem, I have an overall time management problem. Since going back on adderall, this has improved, but not perfect. Heres a few token tips that help me:

- Adderall first thing when I wake up. Not after my shower, not after breakfast, and not after I check out reddit/facebook. Keep it in your nightstand with a bottle of water. When your first alarm rings, take it and snooze. You probably wont be able to keep snoozing once meds kick in.

- Clocks. Clocks everywhere! Every room has AT LEAST one clock. I have a clock in my shower. Too often I get cocky about how much time I have and I start lollygagging. Having a clock in view at all times really cuts down on that. 

- Set multiple alarms as a countdown while getting ready. Just to remind myself I only have Thirty, Fifteen, and ten more minutes until I have to leave. 

- I accepted that this is my main weakness in life, and I will ALWAYS struggle with this. The minute I let my guard down because I feel I've overcome it or have established good habits, Its like an instant backslide and within days all of my hard work was for nothing.

Good luck! Oh, and forget the ol' ""Set your clocks to be 4 minutes fast"" at best it works for a week.

"206","MIND MAPS!

I discovered mind mapping after my diagnosis. They help me so much. I use mind maps to break complex tasks down all the time. We have to break things down - it's part of the territory with ADHD - and we rarely think in a linear fashion. Mind maps are perfect for my brain bouncing around. Then I get the extra dopamine hit of having something cool laid out visually after working on it for a little while.

There have been multiple times when I felt overwhelmed by a task and used mind mapping to calm me down. After I separate the central goal into bite sized tasks, I either create a checklist in the map or transfer it to my to-do list. Now I have a linear set of steps created after letting my brain just go crazy and dump things into a map in whatever order it wants.","f1zjnwo",1,1569844655,"2019-09-30 11:57:35"

"258","True. But, somewhat, rightly so. The same thing can be applied to getting a prescription for any narcotic drug. Adderall IS a methamphetamine. You can get addicted to it and it comes with a slue of side effects. 

If you're a doctor, and prescribing Adderall or other ADHD methamphetamines is a part of your job, and you're not looking out for people who abuse it, then that's just being a careless (and rather reckless) doctor. If doctors don't view everyone with a bit of suspicion, then what's the point of regulating it? You can't look at someone and immediately identify them as someone who abuses Adderall. It's being someone going through the airport. The TSA looks at everyone with suspicion, and rightly so.

"262","Congratulations on what seems like a well deserved promotion!

I've been in your shoes before a couple times, and have definitely fucked it up before and ended up burning out - if I could do anything differently there it would be to communicate my struggles more with my manager. They are there to help you and they want you to succeed.

How big is the change? Is the work itself very different or is it just the work load? Both situations can present different obstacles and struggles and both can be mitigated.

Remember too that no matter what you do, you are going to have bad days where you struggle. This is a period of growth for you..before things may have been easier and more predictable, and you may be feeling a bit of a culture shock now that you're being challenged. This is uncomfortable, but it's good. Don't let yourself think for a second that you've failed, simply because you are not immediately 100% comfortable and fabulous at everything. It just means that you're growing to the point where your natural aptitude and ability has met a worthy match and when you're not used to that it's so easy to beat yourself up and feel like a failure. Fight this feeling, because that mentality is the *only* thing that will hold you back in the end. You have the ability to overcome everything else, I promise - it might take some time and patience, but you're leveling up, and this is all natural.

"264","Try to change you attitude about therapy and your psychiatrist. You're not going to those appointment because those people are your friends. You're going because you need *help* and they are resources that can potentially help you to make changes and get better. I have no idea if my therapist likes talking to me. But it's her job to talk to me, and it's my personal responsibility *to myself* to keep going because I need help working through my issues. Whether she likes me as a person has nothing to do with our agreement because it *is* a business transaction, which is sort of the point of therapy. I'm not trying to impress her and I'm not hiding all the icky parts of myself that my friends don't get. That frees me up to actually address my shit and allows her to help me work through it. 

If the therapists at your college really aren't helping you improve, I'd say keep pushing on that issue and trying to see someone else. But I'd change the way you talk/ask about it. Don't say that you feel like they don't enjoy talking to you, because that doesn't matter to whether they're doing their job or not. Try to examine if they're actually incompetent or if you're just too insecure right now to handle your feelings about being too annoying. If they're not doing their job right, emphasize that they are not actually providing you with the helpful benefits of therapy that you need when you ask for a switch.

I still struggle with sleeplessness but not NEARLY as bad as when I was a kid. I did/do have a lot of nighttime-related anxiety, so it might have been a little different from your guy. I know you keep him away from screens, and while maybe my eyes did not appreciate it, one thing I had started doing that helped a lot as an older kid was playing my DS before bed, and it was always like, a game that was kinda peaceful. One of those ""Petz"" games or Animal Crossing or something. It was like after five minutes of playing my eyes would be so tired, I'd just roll over and sleep.

Maybe for your kid its the lack of stimulation. For the past 2 1/2 years I've been listening to ASMR and whitenoise when I sleep and it has helped a lot. Sometimes there are nights where it is too much, so I just take out my earbuds and roll over and knock out, but usually it helps me fall asleep quite easily.

I was on adderal for the past 7 years. I switched it up to bupropion + much less adderal.

I don't drink while on adderal. I've had to many bad cases because i allow myself to drink way too much.

With bupropion, I dont feel like I need to drink. When I do drink, it feels like it takes me less to get drunk or have effects, I almost feel like my addictive tenancies aren't in overdrive and having me excited to competitively drink.

So other than a noticable lower tolerance, I'd say it worked better for me, but as all cases with ADD/ADHD no two cases are the same. Same applies here I believe. My doctor told me I didn't have to worry about drinking, sex drive, etc. (though I don't have sex as often, again, addictive traits that are dopamine seeking aren't as severe) I feel like I do things at a much more stable and normal amount now.

"286","TL;DR diagnosed by special education administrators in conjunction with my MD at age 8 (I'm now 31).

I was diagnosed as a child. I exhibited contradictory characteristics throughout k-3rd grade. For example, I could recite from memory every detail I had learned about a given topic with what was described as ""goosebump inducing detail"" by more than one of my elementary teachers when they were consulted for my evaluation.  Nonetheless, I couldn't stay focused in class long enough to complete worksheets to demonstrate my knowledge. This was confounding to teachers, who were forced to give me low marks based on the body of work I was able to complete, despite the fact that they felt I was among those with the best understanding and retention in the class. They decided to test my IQ and evaluate me for learning disabilities. My IQ was essentially off the charts (I don't know what the number 175 means now because I was a child then and I sure don't feel that smart anymore haha) and they recommended treatment for ADD. I still remember starting medication and finding myself (almost) able to complete worksheets and other tasks in school without stopping. My handwriting improved overnight. I began earning the marks I deserved (mostly), though I still struggled in some subjects and in some regards (just like I do today).

I then stopped my meds in high school because I didn't like the side effects that developed over time as my dose of ritilan was increased (loss of appetite, anxiety). I was struggling with my identity and accepting my sexuality at the time (I was 15). My life went to shit within 1 year of stopping meds. I didn't realize it at the time, but I so longed for the effects my meds provided, when I found illegal drugs that did exactly what my meds did (just 1000x harder and 10x longer) I became addicted to stimulants (illicit) from 16-24 in what I now understand to be a tragic self-medication attempt. 

I managed to get clean 8 years ago as of may 31st and within a year, it was all too clear that I was the same ADD kid I was in elementary school without medication, just all grown up. My life felt out of control, despite taking control in such a huge way in beating back the grip of my addiction. I found a doctor that was rational enough to listen to me and recognize that I desperately needed a controlled dose of the type of substances I self medicated with. I was labeled a drug seeker by several doctors and dismissed prior to finding her.  to make matters worse, my insurance at the time was kind of backwards when it came to mental health cell without a referral or suspected diagnosis from primary provider, I was not even eligible for therapy.  She rediagnosed me with adult ADD after spending 2-3 appointments with me. She managed to obtain my pediatric medical records and she realized she was literally reading about the exact same person that stood before her (like I said, just all grown up). I was put back on to medication and my career began to soar in a straight line up. The diagnosis and treatment I received truly changed my life and allowed me to obtain a sense of security and freedom I never thought possible when I was in the throes of my addiction.  Despite being such a long time abuser of narcotic stimulants, I haven't once had the urge to misuse or abuse my medication (Adderall). In fact, the biggest struggle was finding the right dose which actually meant reducing the dose they had initially step me up to because the side effects begin to outweigh the therapeutic benefits. I think the reason these drugs have not threatened my recovery is because it provides me such a great sense of relief and I have such an aversion to the side effects that come with too high of a dose because of the trauma my addiction left me with.  I'm just so incredibly grateful for the opportunity I've been given to have a second try at my adult life and cherish every day since. I would be lying if I said my diagnosis was not a huge part of the success I now enjoy.","foylzi8",1,1588174911,"2020-04-29 15:41:51"

I also take a hella low dose opiate, and it's absolutely the same case, with the exception of who the patient is.

But I don't want to sound like a hypocrite here and I should probably take my own advice but I've found that if you're taking the medication as you should, it doesn't help you start things, but it does help you stay doing them. You have to want to be more productive, it's not going to happen magically. But if you force yourself to do something hard that you don't want to do, you'll find that it's so much easier than when your not on medication and it will become habit. This already ingrained habit you have of putting things off even when you know you have help is one of the hardest things to get rid of for someone who is recently diagnosed with ADHD and i'm still having issues with it.

Easy path = hard life

Inductive reasoning is usually the biggest weedout. At least it is termed that at all the local universities in my area.

We do it differently. Stacks, queues and binary trees are all introduced in CS 201. Algorithms is a 2nd semester 200 level course that people take before they declare their true major. 

Then the 300 level course builds on that, and usually makes people want to quit the program if not life itself.

I think your mention of pointers might have a lot to do with it. If you're using C++, and hence pointers, you're going to be in the weeds of implementation details when it comes to data structures.

Yet conceptually a LIFO queue is pretty simply; but I know some people who even today can grind through some very useful algorithms in any language unless you told them to do it in C or C++ and manually manage their own memory.","cz4ygs6",2,1453272709,"2016-01-20 06:51:49"

"331","Good on your doctor for calling for more tests. One of the things that has led to the overdiagnosis of ADHD (and trust me, it *is* overdiagnosed) is the overwhelming reliance on initial patient interviews over other methods, like using EEGs and the like. When I was diagnosed at the age of five, my parents made it very clear that they wanted to be *absolutely sure* that I did in fact have ADHD before they'd commit to any treatment. As such, they got a confirmation from a) our family physician, b) an expert psychologist specializing in learning and neurodevelopmental disorders, and c) a neurologist, all of whom agreed that yes, my frontal lobe was in fact acting up. Only *then* did they agree to put me on meds. Over the years, I've been retested several times, and while I have indeed done pretty well for myself, their initial diagnosis still stands.

Remember this: even if you *do* have ADHD, it may be a fairly mild case that doesn't need much in the way of medication to be treated. But an ADHD diagnosis is an ADHD diagnosis, no matter the severity.","damrpei",1,1480546878,"2016-11-30 23:01:18"

30mg seemed to take around 1-2 weeks. The therapeutic effects remained for the entire time I was on it(~a year). My new prescription is Desoxyn and it took about 3 days at 10-15mg to cap, and about another week at 20. But the therapeutic effects are available well under where you can tell you've taken something. Esp. with Desoxyn, you can hardly feel it at all. 

I've been on it 2 months and I continue to be surprised at my willingness to get things done despite a nagging feeling that I'd rather keep slacking off, then not being followed by a feeling of shit a few hours after taking it like on vyvanse. 

I was also on ritalin for a month, I don't think it helped much whatsoever so I'd say 0 days for tolerance there.

It sounds so similar to what I've been dealing with, especially the fact that I didn't suspect I had ADHD until a few years ago. I'm 25 now, and really struggled to get through college, and later to keep up at work. I thought I just happened to be lazy but smart enough to get by.

I constantly wondered why I couldn't be productive like other students, no matter how much I wanted to be. I still vividly remember one incident where I was just sitting in the student lounge late at night. I was so stressed out, I knew I had homework due the next day, but I couldn't summon the will to start it. I had been an A+ student in high school with my parents reminding me about things and taking me to class, but in college I was always late and turned in assignments that I'd barely completed an hour ago. I felt like I had no willpower. 

Looking back, I'm convinced a lot of the issues I had stemmed from ADHD, but I thought it was just depression at the time. I went on depression meds after freshman year and that helped me not stay in bed all day, but it never stopped being a huge struggle to complete my work, show up to class, and pay attention. I can still remember the frequent feeling of dread when I showed up to a class only to realize I'd forgotten an important assignment.

Every answer is an opportunity for you to help  them figure out how unhelpful they are being.
Because they are hurting you.

You ask them this because you want the real answer. If they are getting mad at you about the clothes they might be feeling disrespected. If so, you need them to understand that this isn't how it works.

You also may not need a lot of medication. You seem very concerned with withdrawal effects, etc, but you're only going to get those if you end up needing/using a high dose. I only use 15mg of Adderall XR, for instance. Some people only need a low dose. 

In my opinion, there's no need to suffer. I was only diagnosed at the beginning of the year, at 31.

Quick advice - You are not supposed to do things for 2 people. Just because you have ADHD and have hard time cleaning or doing laundry doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. There are tons of tips and tricks online how to set up systems that work for ADHD people. (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nPM1_kSZf91ZGkcgy_95Q)

Quick advice 2 - Just because you have ADHD doesn't mean you are bad at everything. I can't do laundry for life, but when i go into kitchen and start cooking i can get lost for 3 hours and meal-prep for days in advance.

Quick advice 3 - TALK TALK TALK. Same as with life there will always be problems in relationships. It is not about eliminating all of them and living happily ever after. It is about having systems in place to deal with them. Not talking with your bf about what is bothering you is slippery slope.

Lastly, on the behalf of young ADHD guys, thanks for you support :) I would never be where i am without help of my  GF who sounds just like you.","dvkk9u5",13,1520856058,"2018-03-12 12:00:58"

I know if I had have been thrown on drugs at such an age, I would have been very angry and defiant about it.

I'd say, talk to your kid first, see what he things about the medication. If he even slightly doesn't understand what or why he is on them, get rid. If he does, but he doesn't wish to take them still, get rid. If he understands, and wishes to continue, accept it as his choice.

"396","What you need to understand about ADHD, is that it is caused by a faster-than-average reuptake of dopamine in the pre frontal cortex.  What that means is that, besides symptoms like inattentiveness or hyperactivity, there are further clues that can help determine if you are a person with ADHD.

Basically, when we feel happy or, more specifically, when we feel like we've accomplished something, dopamine floods our brain.  The slower it is reabsorbed, the slower it is ""mopped up"" in your brain, the longer it stays active in your synpases and you feel that happy, accomplished feeling. 

People with ADHD absorb that same dopamine but at a FASTER rate, meaning that they need MORE hits of dopamine (what would seem excessive to ""average"" people), in order to achieve that same amount of satisfaction you feel.

This lack of dopamine is what leads to, in some cases, inattentiveness. The brain needs something new, something shiny, to give itself a squirt of dopamine.  It can also, in others, mean hyperactivity.  You have to get up, you have to be squirming and fidgeting because you are antsy for that extra hit of dopamine.

In other people (like myself), this lack of dopamine can be satiated by turning to substances, which can lead to addictive and reckless behaviour. Suddenly 3 beers isn't stimulating enough, so you go to 5, then 7, etc.

So my point here is that if you want to determine for yourself if you really do have ADHD, see if you can find any behaviours in yourself that match this kind of dynamic.  Because if you really DO have ADHD, it is very likely that the inattentiveness and concentration isn't the only issue - there are probably some other aspects of your personality that would benefit by being seen through this light.  I know it helped me a lot understand my addictions when I got diagnosed with ADHD.

One of the worst things with adhd, is this guilt that comes with it. i've learned over the years that besides genuinely enjoying certain shows and sports, i just desperately need some ""screen time"" of any kind, to recharge. Because there's something about it that soothes my over-stimulated mind and it's like a safe enviornment for my ideas to safely wander and make associations. 

and i get this overstimulation in the first place, from being most productive and happy in a busy enviornment with lots of background noise. 

so on my end of the spectrum, i tend to beat myself up for watching too much tv. after beating myself from going out to work in cafes, wasting time and spending money when i could just work at home (i work freelance).","g2o2zkg",1,1598252089,"2020-08-24 06:54:49"

Me (pissed now that he doesn't believe in my abilities ): ""well excuuuuuse me. I WILL put you back on with him.""

He ended up understanding that he offended me,  and things got ugly. Once it calmed down and he started following my instructions, I solved his problem in a matter of minutes.

Then yesterday-

Customer : *yelling at me about something I can't control* ""The people you contacted about my problem are just lazy and insubordinate and don't want to do their job!""

Me: ""You said earlier that this wasn't a personal matter, that it's not about feelings. But you're calling my colleagues lazy and that's inappropriate.""

"413","Some of these things are, to some extent, under your control.

You don't have to become an entirely new or different person to have friends. However, you do have to work on yourself. Not every person will like you, no matter what you do, but you do have the ability to get along with others a little better. 

Do you feel like you can teach yourself to talk a little slower? That will give you time to sort out your ideas. It's also totally okay to ask people to give you a moment to sort out your thoughts. I know that when I meet new people, I get super nervous and either can't stop talking or can't make myself talk at all. When I notice myself talking a lot, I know that 1. I'm nervous, and 2. I need to give other people a chance to speak. Being a little quieter and just listening does several things: it keeps me from being perceived as annoying for talking too much, gives me a chance to calm down and regroup, and helps me learn about the other people and be seen paying attention to them and caring about what they have to say. I love people, honestly, so I love listening to them, I just get super nervous, especially because I feel like people just forget about me if I don't stand out enough.

Not keeping your head down all the time will help with your posture and clumsiness. I trip all the time and often lose track of what's happening around me if I don't look around, so I don't wear headphones when I'm walking and I'm always looking around and paying attention to what I'm doing. Looking up also gives you chances to see people you'd like to become better friends with and to reinforce those relationships. It also makes you look more open and confident, even if you don't feel that way.

I used to rehearse scenarios in front of the mirror and sometimes when I was walking around, almost compulsively. I still mouth stuff and I definitely talk with my hands, even when I'm wandering around alone. I try to quell it a little, but I don't sweat it too much. It helps me think, so as long as I don't do anything too intense, I just do my thing. 

You're also being really, really hard on yourself, especially with that negative self-talk. Are you getting help of any sort? I did a lot of the same things you did and it took me a lot of time, effort, and outside help to really get it under control.

"429","With respect mate, what you are experiencing is likely the remnants of solid habits you developed during your medicated period.  Sure, you find it harder to concentrate but for the most part, the artificial structure you will have developed will help in much the same way as CBT on depressed individuals helps them after their meds end.

However, let's take you out of the structured school environment and put you into a job.  Those structures and routines fall apart.  Maybe you cope, but Vegas odds suggest that something gives, somewhere and your life gets materially worse unless that job suits your routine exactly.

The point at which that happens is different for all of us.  For me, it was at 17 where my own stochastic studying process and natural ability wasnt enough to keep ahead of the curriculum and I actually had to concentrate a little.  I was being taught maths in a sensory overloading environment and I couldn't see straight.

That cost me nearly a decade.  With ADHD meds, I have no doubt I would have sailed to an A and probably gone to the university of my choice.

The meds remove impediments to your thought process - mainly the ability to tolerate boredom long enough to get interested in something you want to do, and the ability to self motivate. 

Right now you are in an environment where the motivation is still partly external.  For me, the environment of university wasnt enough, and as you say, you still take them before tests.

I didn't have that option.  I am not looking for help on tests because I am past that point.  I am tired of being exhausted after work because it took all my effort and massive amounts of sugar and caffeine to fight through today's brain fog.

"456","I'm unsure of where you're located, however in the US, you can get an accurate diagnosis from a testing center. Mine was a learning center (I think? I can't remember), and I know that the college I am currently at offers ADHD testing through a professor and grad students (again, I'm not entirely sure that's what it was, but it included grad students yet was still legitimate). Both are great options and give you more than just a questionnaire to fill out. The learning center was close to $1000, but was covered under insurance, where as the university's was closer to $250. They didn't only cover ADHD, but included other learning disorders too. You could have ADHD, or maybe something completely different, but you won't know until you get tested for it. NOTE: make sure that your diagnosis is listed on your formal report. It should clearly state ""we are diagnosing blah blah as ___"", or something very clear and straightforward that they are the ones diagnosing you. Ask them to do this ahead of time, and they will make sure it's done. (Mine didn't do this and had to have new testing done because of it.) Schedule your assessment as soon as possible, as the places I know are booked for months ahead of time.

Once you get a diagnosis, find a therapist/psychologist who is suited for your age and those with adhd (or what you end up being diagnosed with). A psychiatrist is also helpful in prescribing medication, as well as providing you with information on testing centers and therapists/psychologist that would suit you best.

For now, continue going to a therapist, maybe the first one, maybe a completely different one, but instead of focusing on whether or not you have adhd in your sessions, focus on what you're experiencing and the help they can give you instead of a diagnosis.","cpjpzvr",1,1426756312,"2015-03-19 09:11:52"

Adderall has been a game changer for me. Complete 180. I was even able to get off cymbalta for depression and anxiety for a time. I didn't need it because I was actually accomplishing things which evaporated the anxiety/depression.  But then I started a new demanding job and started the cymbalta again. Lexapro was not the best for me. Wellbutrin just made me angry and effexor was the best antidepressant for me, along with cymbalta, but bad side effects with effexor. My new psych also recommended Vyvanse for ADHD instead of adderall but much more expensive. He said it's a little smoother than the drop-off effects of adderall.

Your son should also get a therapist so he can learn to regulate his emotions and express his needs in a constructive way. They can also provide you valuable advice on how to best support him.

I also suggest having a meeting with his teachers to-be and discuss what their action plans for kids with ADHD are. How do they accomodate his needs. For example, when kids have to sit at desks and work, it can be helpful if the ADHD child is allowed to get up when they need to and walk around quietly until they can sit down and work again.

Routine is critical! 

Children in general like structure but the ADHD brain really needs it. The minute I woke up there was a plan in place. Set meal times. Limited choices like do you want milk or juice (prevents choice paralysis). Scheduled play time with mummy, playtime by myself, things like swim class or play group. Bedtime routine went bath, PJs and a bedtime story, lights out. 

If he's physically hyperactive then sports could be a real lifesaver. Kids need to get out and run around and he might need that more than most.

when you think the meds arent working, is the ti.e that you will need to understand how your ADHD works and how it ""nudged"" you into making poor choices in the past.

How many people in your life know the truth? 

It took a looooong time for my frienda and family to realize; there are certain things that we CAN NOT ask of him, they just won't get done. 

Buuuuuuuuut - I imagine, as is the case with me, there are certain things that ONLY you can do.

My mom would get mad 'cause I ""forgot"" to mow the lawn, all the time. But when she made the suggestion of switching the yard to a desert-scape, and getting rid of the grass - I single handedly drew up plans and designs, sourced materials, and had a budget all ready to go in about 2 hours. She ok'd one of my designs and some friends and I pounded it out in a couple days...

We suck at tedium. We are the Bobby Hill to the type-A's Hank Hill. They love to mow, and sweep, and grind...meanwhile - we would much rather design and build a robot that handles all the mowing, sweeping, and grinding, because fuuuuuuuck that repetitive, boring shit...

Its really hard to find a workplace that can accept us for what we are, too. These places work on a schedule and protocols. While we...work in our own way. One time my boss had accused me of doing nothing all day, until she realized that I had just done things in a different order than she'd written down, because....idk why really, but something told me to do it that way - and it worked out in such a way that everything sorta came together in the last hour of my shift. It looked like I'd done nothing all day, then, BOOM, Done, ✔. 

The important thing is to get your shit done. Do it your way, but DO IT. Usually you can earn a little slack, and people start to learn to work with you. You are a valuable asset, you have ADHD, it's not entirely a bad thing!","fyogfah",3,1595266795,"2020-07-20 17:39:55"

This is typically the variety that girls get. Some boys get it too; such as myself. People with ADHD-PI tend the fly under the radar as children, because they're not a disturbance.

"567","First of all, you should be spending your energy finding a doctor you DO feel safe and trusting around. This thing that you're doing, adjusting your own medication in the absence of documented ""harmful or deadly"" side effects is not a good idea at all.

You are going about this backwards and to be honest, you really have absolutely NO idea whether it is really the Adderall that is causing these tics. It could just as easily be stress, diet, excercise, or other lifestyle issue. You need a doctor you trust to help you to find this out, not starting to play around with your medication.

I'll say it again. STOP self-diagnosing yourself based on this tic. You don't know what is causing it. FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR and then move forward with a change in treatment.","ce6n4kw",0,1387577971,"2013-12-20 22:19:31"

"571","I didn't really have role models as a child. (not saying there weren't people modeling good behaviour or ethics etc.. I had them in plenty). I am talking about the more usual scene of 'I really admire and look up to x and want to be like him/her'. I couldn't see what the big deal was either even when my parents told me having role models is important.

Over time I realized that there's an aspect of idealism in a refusal to have a role model.. I felt like there should be nothing negative about that person, which obviously is nonsense since everyone's a human.

Today I accept that I don't do role models per se. Instead I have a whole group of people I truly admire for one of their qualities or another. As an example, the young me would dismiss Steve Jobs from consideration coz many people call him egotistical and worse.. The current me would say I admire him for his attention to design, and his work ethic for example.

So when you say you don't have role models.. Maybe there's something similar in play? With my current system that focuses more on the exact qualities I want to emulate and the people who demonstrate at least one of those well.. I've found it very helpful. I can visualize what that quality looks like in daily life, actions, decisions, behaviours as well as in terms of blindspots..

Self love is the key to finding happiness and love in every other aspect of life. Once you have self love, you wont worry so much about what other people think about you. Sometimes I find myself wishing I was “normal” but then I remember, there is no normal. We are all unique in our own ways, we just have ADHD which makes it harder to relate to people without the disorder. They dont understand us which makes us feel weird and apart from everyone else. Just always be yourself no matter what, as time goes on your friends will start to understand you more, and make you feel more loved and accepted.

"587","ADHD parent here with an 11 year old with and a 7 year old *maybe* with. I'll try to look at other comments to see if there's stuff I can help answer, but attention eyyyy

The things I've learned that I feel are most important, both for yourself and your kids, is that structure is important. Even if you don't follow it perfectly, having a plan and trying to stick to it is important for managing, well anything really. A written schedule that the children contribute to helps, and doing your best to follow it. It won't always be possible, but kids need to see that nothing is perfect and goes according to plan always anyways. And giving them some ownership of it helps keep them interested intrinsically.

Also, the urge is strong to make them do things a certain way. Don't do that, give them success criteria but not always exact steps. When they ask for help or ""how"" give advice but be careful to explain that it's the way you would do it and *why*. This has helped me in the sense that when I tell them it needs to be done a specific way for whatever reason they (hopefully) understand that there's a reason for that and they want to know why.

And this one is the hardest *by far* for me. When they want you to do something with them but it's horribly uninteresting to you it'll be *so hard* to just sit down and do it. Being mindful of that, realizing what's going on and just trying for a little bit means the world to them. And I also absolutely reward myself when I do that, it's selfish but sometimes it's the only way I can get myself to play games that they want to play or do activities they want to do but I loathe. I hate it but I accept that it's a shortcoming of mine and just work with it the best I can.

Dunno if any of these help, but I'm happy to give any advice about anything you ask, if you want. Good luck!","fn7c7u6",1,1586717463,"2020-04-12 18:51:03"

"615","Well as a fellow adult diagnosed with ADD I know exactly what you are going through as I've been down that exact road. 

The hardest part is that we've had 30 odd years of thinking and doing things our own way. Then we get diagnosed get some pills and boom magic is suppose to happen and we are automatically ""cured""

Well that's what I thought but it's not the way it is my friend. We have to work extra hard at ""reprogramming""( for lack of a better word) our brain. Here's something's that helped me when I got diagnosed;

-An app called NOTE'd is an amazing list making app that has helped me so much. It's like having a bunch of separate note books in your pocket for various tasks like household chores, work reminders , stuff wifey asks you to do, grocery list etcetc

-a support group, where I am here in Canada I found a local adhd/add support group and I go to the meetings. We sit around talk about how our weeks have been goals we've reached and goals we want to achieve. It's a great peer support system we all help each other out working though individual issues we might have

-diet/exercise, I've totally changed my diet and lifestyle. I've stopped drinking and cut out almost all processed and sugary foods. Studies have shown that eating excess processed foods and sugar can lead to lower brain function. Also by working out it releases serotonin in the brain(the feel good stuff) and it works to increase blood flow and brain activity. This I've been able to lower my daily dose of concerta. I was at 72mg pre lifestyle change now I'm at 18mg every other day. 

-sleep schedule. Well that's a hard one but I used to love to stay up all night watch stuff on Netflix play Xbox etcetc. But trust me having a routine will be your best friend. Even on my days off I go to bed and wake up at the same time. 11pm bed up at 620. Routine is what I've found works best for me and for people from my support group. Like my morning routine is the same everyday exactly. It's boring but it helps make sure I get all the stuff done I need to in the morning. Like feeding the dogs, walking the dogs, taking my meds, packing my lunch, putting my paperwork back into my bag for work. Try it for afew weeks and see if it helps. 

-now with your wife. I don't know how yours is but my now ex wife wasn't very understanding. It's not her fault she was a perfectionist. So what I recommend is having her read the book Delivered from Distraction. It's a great book for people who don't have ADD to see what it's like to be in our heads for a day. Then sit down and talk to her about it and how you can work together to make things easier for you both. 

Also when she talks and you are stating to zone out or not pay attention tell her. Say baby I'm having a hard time absorbing everything right now can we take a break for a minute and come back to it. 

You'd be surprised I use this during meetings, phone conversations and talk with my girlfriend. It just gives you a little mental time out to get refocused on what the person that is talking to you is saying. 

That's about it it's late and I'm feel like I could keep going but I think I've touched on what I think can help you out. 

Like I said bud, I've been in your exact position if you want to talk more or have any questions I am here to help you out.

However I know I NEED to eat. Plus not eating makes the crash much worse than if I eat (but even if I don't eat the crash is still nothing compared to how bad it was for me when I was on Addy). My solution? I just try to force myself to eat when I knew I should, even though I am not hungry.

I only take meds a couple times a week so my tolerance is low so every time I take it I loose my appetite so before I take it I set reminders on my phone at specific times to eat.

Now my method might work if you just don't feel hungry but if you get sick at the thought of eating while on it, I don't know what to tell you. Sorry that was more of a rant than any help (I am on them as we speak so... lol) ","d6qkmab",1,1471787779,"2016-08-21 13:56:19"

"632","This happened to me too. My doctor told my mom that my brother is autistic with ADHD and I may have a learning disability or possible ADHD. I wasn’t hyper but I had really severe focus issues, impulsivity, anxiety and sensory overload. I was losing homework, forgetting assignments , over talkative in class and disrupted class often. 
My teachers said that they suspect ADHD and advised my parents that I be tested. My mom is very anti  modern med and she thinks medication is a crutch. I never got tested.
So I spent my high school and college years barely getting by, changed my major 5 times. Hyper focused on everything but homework. It was a mess. Deadlines were the bane of my existence.
I wanted to get tested at 25 since I was feeling so scattered and out of control. So hyper and unfocused that my store manager screamed at me in front of customers. I was laughing, talking loud and fast and not getting a single thing done. I could not force myself to put away stock because finding the location for the product was a hard task for me.
Now, a few jobs later I got a desk job . Worse mistake. I couldn’t sit still, doing phone calls inbound and outbound was a nightmare for me. I couldn’t dissect information and had a hard time not zoning out while on calls. I was really behind and was written up for performance issues. 2 more write ups and I would be let go.
I went to my psychiatrist and told her everything and how I was tired of it. Embarrassing, but I actually cried . She said that I have ADHD with a combo of both types. She had been observing me and my behavior durning appointments . 
It took a long time. To get diagnosed. The best advice I can give is to go get tested ASAP, push what the neurotypicals have been saying to the back of your mind. It’s about you and your brain. Not any of their business. 

Your health insurance should be able to help you find a psychiatrist or facility that treats and test for ADHD. Your PCP can send a referral as well. Definitely do your  research and read reviews on psychiatrists that you are interested in. I read reviews on vitals.com .

You can do it! I try and set small goals for myself and that helps me focus. 2 slides/ hour that sort of thing, then i can race against the clock and keep track of my timing- although drifting off focus still happens occasionally. 
And about being 24 and in second year.. I'll admit I felt embarrassed at first, mostly because all of my friends have graduated and went on to grad school or are doing other things and I felt like a failure in comparison. but I asked myself if i really wanted to graduate with a degree and whether or not i wanted to be here, and that answer was yes. I could either try my best now and suck it up being older or I could quit, and realizing that made it more clear.

I think, once you stop trying to fit into an average life style, doing things in average ways, stop judging yourself based on the average attitude, and start working within your own operational parameters you can benefit from the positive sides of the cards that life has dealt you.

There is no normal. There is an average, but there are very few people who fall within a few percent of the average. The human quality spectrum is very large. Even though people with ADHD and other dealt cards tend to be far away from average, does not mean that their life won't be just as positive and fulfilling as anyone else's.

Many of those people have special diets. Usually, I tell them go eat something they can't eat or highly allergic too. Right now they are not having trouble with it, so why should they later?

People would say this to my brother, who is bipolar. His response was that he doesn't get better, ever. He will always be on the verge of killing them and wearing their skin. They would laugh and he would just do this really creepy smile until they stopped laughing. He would usually be kind enough to attempt to explain that there was no getting better.

She said it's pretty common with undiagnosed ADHDers as a way to self-medicate and noted it actually can help us calm our brain to focus on one thing instead of 100 things, which for me it absolutely does. 

My PCP (at a major Boston hospital) and ADHD psychiatrist have said the same things about weed, which surprised me at first, I think attitudes are changing greatly in the medical field at least where I am on the east coast.

It's definitely true for me that weed helps myfocus, I can get more work done and get out of my own head, but I'm sure it's not for everyone. I don't drink often though, because alcohol is the exact opposite, it amplifies all the things I hate the most about my adhd -- talking too much, blurting things out, impulsivity, hyperactivity, inability to focus on one thing.

My Uni counselling center has a bunch of MP3s on their website.
The one I did in class was 'the blue mist meditation' but the '8 minute to calm' is recommended to start with. I can' comment on the mp3s yet because I have not had change to listen to them yet (I'm in the middle of creating a yoga space [nothing hippie-dippie just some candles etc.]  in the corner of my bedroom) but the guy doing the mp3 was pretty funny and nice when he was doing the lesson so it is likely the mp3's are a decent source to start with.

i also had a great success on my meds, but i've noticed that for the last couple of months they haven't been as effective. i'm scheduled with my psychiatrist in a week, and most definitely will tell her about it... to be honest, i just want my dosage to be fixed, but i've also read about tolerance breaks, and so maybe i can try that for maybe a week on the holidays. 
what i can say, if you allow me to, is to take a break, take a step back from all of it. let yourself rest... stop thinking for a while. seriously, sleep 24 hours if you need to. then, when you've had enough bedtime: write it all down, pen and paper. crying can help too. journaling is like having therapy by yourself. set your priorities straight, just for your peace of mind. and above all, treat yourself with kindness, cause life's already too tough. it will take time, and consistent effort but i'm pretty sure you can figure it out. also be honest with your doctor, they are *supposed* to help.","gf98pyb",1,1607584325,"2020-12-10 07:12:05"

* **#1** Your own internal actions are shaped by your environment

* **#2** The environment pushes back on your actions, you are more effective in certain environments and less effective in others.

* **#3** What environment is the most effective at pushing back for you is different from person to person.

* **#4** You need to find the right environmental triggers and environmental situation for you, so you can treat your ADHD.  You need to do this even if you are on medication, medication+environment is better than medication alone.  In some people modifying the environment alone is better than medication+enviroment for some people have side effects due to medicine.

It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. This means that Dodson, his explanation of these experiences, and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

At the time i was also diagnosed with an eye condition but was not  developed enough to be considered .
All the behaviours tests and  reports including self reports indicated ADHD . ritalin was effective I was calm considerate and more thoughtful but the crashes where rough and I would not eat and couldn't sleep , we tried numerous medications but had many side effects, concerta worked well but I discontinued medication because I was ignorant and didn't like how I felt on medication. I ended up taking drugs recreationally through most of high school ( mainly cannabis )  which it was only when I stopped at age 18  I realised ADHD was a huge problem , mainly because cannabis allowed me to deal with my hyperactivity and restlessness and it wasn't until the next few years that I came to terms with exactly how ADHD was effecting me 

 My pediatrician was an  American and had an extensive background in child ADHD, his conclusion was moderate  symptoms of ADHD without odd  ,  

 My  current practioner has only requested a questionnaire from  myself only and  multiple short vague interviews , he hasnt portrayed any indication  that he requires anything further as each appointment here in is nothing more than a check up of my circumstances and capacity .

half a GPA point doesn't mean anything for public universities, as long as it's above the base acceptance level and hits whatever scholarship benchmarks they have (scholarships = good).  Not taking AP chem in high school simply means you'll take that course in college.  in the grand scheme of things, it's no big deal.  whatever you can do to get your school paid for, though, *do it.*

the biggest thing you can do to help you now is develop good study skills and get into a few good habits, like waking up on time.

* Are you most worried that you ""need"" to go to school but can't afford it? 
* Are you most worried that you'll make the wrong choice in your major?
* Are you most worried that you'll be unable to perform well in school?
* Are you most worried that you'll lose your parent's support if you fail to follow their expectations?

&gt;    I worked for a convenience store, but one unlike most because we have a full on bakery that serves hot food all day and prepares fresh deli foods for store counters as well. The bakery is usually open 4 am to 6 pm, bringing in about a thousand dollars in sales per day while only staffed by one person with a little overlap between shifts. It is a very fast paced, demanding and chaotic work environment, you need to be very aware of time and how long things take and very organized and able to structure yourself.

That is exactly how you are going to describe your job in an interview or on your resume.

When I was first entering the labor force, I had to unlearn many norms of what I had taken to be civilized society, especially the virtues of openness and honesty. To bosses, employers, police, prosecutors, etc., in short, any authority figures with power over your being and your bread, the goal is to create a reasonable fiction that keeps you from being screwed over. Your bosses are not your friends, nor your teachers! Your new manager was happy when you mentioned your ADHD because saw an excuse to offload you.

Proving discrimination is a long, hard road that requires Money for Lawyers. Realize that there are very few protections for workers in the United States. You need to hide and mask any imperfections in the workplace in order to project a veneer of competence and confidence. This can be a challenge for us in the ADHD tribe, used as we are to feeling ashamed and trying to run around fixing our flub-a-dubs. But--remember that your coworkers aren't perfect either! They are playing the game and you must play it too. Many mediocre people get elevated to high stations by projecting confidence and advocating for themselves--by which I mean, advertising their strengths. That's what you're going to start doing. And, good for you for prioritizing your education!

TL;DR Henceforth, as far as your bosses are concerned, you are the greatness. You will reframe all defeats as triumphs.

"734","It's a billion times more complicated than this I'm sure, but I always interpreted it as having ""spent"" all of my dopamine. Think about the euphoria when you first start on this stuff - everything seems worth doing, you almost need to be doing something at all times, tons of motivation and positive affect. Basically, all the great feelings dopamine provides. But the flip side of that dopamine boost is that you use it all up. So the comedown is the opposite - a total lack of the good things dopamine provides. Nothing seems worth doing, you can sit and stare and go blank without feeling like you should be occupied with ANYTHING, no positive affect left.  
  
It's like emptying your bank account and running around all day buying whatever you want. It's great, you get a bunch of stuff you need, a new video game system and all the best games, go buy a great lunch, get driven around everywhere in a limousine... But then at the end of your spree you have no money left - you can't pay for transportation home, you starve because you can't buy groceries for dinner, etc.  
  
**Another really overly simplified metaphor:** in your brain there are bags of dopamine. Usually, if you do something that triggers a ""reward"" feeling (sex, delicious food, win a game, etc.), those bags squirt a little bit of dopamine out - you feel good and are motivated to do that again. That's essentially how a lot of addiction works, you want more and more of that good feeling. It's why stuff like sex and gambling can be addictive. Even if you're not ingesting chemicals, you're getting that dopamine ""hit"" from inside your brain. Adderall goes into your brain and squeezes those bags - your dopamine levels go up (along with some other neurotransmitters, this is insanely simplified) and you get that motivation and energy and overall life is *rewarding*. But then at the end of the day, your bags are all empty until you eat/sleep/wait for your brain to produce more dopamine - and everything is sucks and nothing feels rewarding. No motivation to really do anything. It doesn't seem like you have, but if you've ever abused adderall and taken too much for too long (for instance an all nighter starting with a high dose), this is why each subsequent dose works less and less. It squeezes the bags and gets the last remaining scraps out into your brain, but there's just not as much dopamine to release - hence progressively shitty results until you take a break and replenish yourself.  
(As far as I understand it, meth basically rips the bags open - so you get way more intense and long lasting effects but really fuck up your brain immediately - hence ""not even once"")

- she is forgetful. She will forget to tell me that she will not be coming home for dinner, or forget that she left her charger plugged in, or forget to send a message to someone...
- she has crazy mood swings when sometimes she is close to depression, and sometimes she is full of life
- when I tell her something, if I want her to remember, it must be when she is super attentive. But sometimes she remembers unimportant things and anecdotes about me that I mentioned years ago.
- compares herself to others a lot, which lowers her self-esteem. Often says disproportionality kind things about others: ""She's a genius"" about someone ordinarily clever, or she says I'm the master of lesson planning when I'm just doing my job normally, or that her mom is an excellent cook when she just cooks good things, or that her friend is a top-notch musician when she is just good at what she does...
- at the same time, cannot recognize her own qualities. She plays 3 different instruments and she doesn't accept my compliments when I say she's good at them.   Refuses compliments when I tell her she looks great in that dress.
- is also on the run, except when she is in a bad period of her mood swings. She rarely sits down for breakfast, most often she has breakfast in her car on her way to work. On the weekends she is up early and always has places to go or things to do right away. She never seems to just take the time to be on weekends: have a long breeakfast, sleep in, read for a while, watch a little TV...
- a lot of her relaxing activities are timed because she is afraid she will not stop herself. ""I will watch this one episode and that's it"". ""I will play ukulele for 10 minutes""
- she sets alarms on her phone to remind her of basic things like showering or reading a book but she never respects them
- the only time I've seen her relax was the two first days of school break. She stayed on the couch in a lethargic state for two days straight
- she doesn't sleep a whole lot at night because she is stressed. She ends up having to take long naps on the weekend","ddkfi4u",1,1486714777,"2017-02-10 08:19:37"

Had to switch back and forth between Vyvanse and Adderall for a while due to insurance. I'm currently on Adderall XR once again because of insurance.

I was diagnosed at around age 31 or 32.  It never occurred to me that I was ADHD when I first went to the shrink for help with anxiety, panic attacks, and depression.  What little I knew about ADHD at the time suggested that those with it do poorly in school.  Well, I had been my high school valedictorian, received a full-ride scholarship to every university I applied to, and went to grad school to do a PhD in theoretical physics.  I've _never_ had trouble in school, though I always underperformed relative to my intelligence and the amount of time I put into work.  I was never a slacker, but I could never stay focused.  I was (and still am, unless I've taken Adderall) a cross between a scatterbrained Absent-Minded Professor type and a stereotypical Dumb Blonde.

"757","Certainly it could just be stress. Even with medication we can get easily stressed out and emotional. Aytime you change a med or a dosage, there's going to be some emotional instability because things aren't like they were before. What I can suggest is this:

Ask your psychiatrist to do a genetic test. Mine had me take a mouth swab and send it to a lab, which surprising was covered in full by even my horrible insurance plan. I got a full readout of my results and it turns out I have a gene that indicates I don't respond as well to Adderall as the majority of the population and instead have a gene that indicates I respond better to Strattera. So she lowered my Adderall dose (I still found it helpful but not at high doses) and I started Strattera along with it. It was a much better fit (even though Strattera has its own drawbacks too).

Finding the right meds and doses can take years sometimes. But a DNA test *might* point you in the right direction and hone in on a good fit sooner than that. Don't lose hope. Just remember, no med solution is going to be the perfect solution. Most it can do is level the playing field and then you still have to put in some hard work. But the fact that you even made this post and are looking for solutions here tells me you're self-aware enough to know when things aren't working and you've got what it takes to figure out what's best for you.

My (unknown) search for dopamine release led to drug abuse, penis abuse, risky driving, risky behavior, etc.

Recently I found out I had adhd, and started Ritalin. Not perfect, but it definitely helps, and actually gets rid of my urge to do drugs, etc. 

Through the years I've given up most my vices, other than coffee &amp; porn. Exercise, sports, and hiking also used to help, but my broken down body can't do those things anymore. So there are times where the need for a dopamine release becomes overwhelming and almost unbearable.

I still struggle with it, but I have a few Spotify playlists and my headphones. Music helps me tremendously for my day to day moments. Going for walks in the brilliant sunshine and looking at nature's colors helps, when it's an option.

And recently I've found creative outlets help me tremendously as well. Learning to draw and doing some sketching, and learning beethoveen on an old Casio keyboard is my go-to right now.

It's hodgepodge for me, and some days are better than others, but it helps me muddle through for the most part.

"778","I relate to this! 

I actually decided to get help very late because my parents are immigrant parents and didn't really believe in mental illness. After seriously struggling for a while they gave in.

There were so many signs of me having ADHD as a kid but my mother never went to go get it checked out in fear I'd have a ""Stained record"" or something. 

When I went to my first ever psych, I mentioned I had depression, anxiety, and I was thinking the possibility of ADHD. 

She was extremely reluctant to explore any deeper into ADHD with me and just declared that my issues all stemmed from depression. 

When I wasn't getting any better on antidepressants, I kept pushing for a test or something. It was to the point where she said ""You're really pushing for that ADHD diagnosis huh."" I was so offended, but I guess a lot of people my age do abuse stimulants. 

After a while she gave in and decided to give me a ""test"" except it was just a paper where my mom had to do. 

My mom's English isn't good and she couldn't answer most of them because she wasn't really present a lot of my childhood.   


Out of frustration, my psych handed the paper to me and told me to answer it as if I was looking at my younger self.

In the end, she prescribed me stimulants and I asked if this meant I had an official diagnosis. But she said no and that most stimulants help depression anyways. 

I felt so invalidated. I just wanted to see if what I've been struggling with was real.

"798","It happens, like, after a while, I accept it as the cycle of things. My only worry is turning into the ADHD flavor of Hoarding---where I'm always starting projects but never finishing them, or finding a new hobby. It's gotten to the point where I limit my hobbies to stuff I already have part of, or something I don't need more actual physical parts to do.

So far:

-Knitting--part of the cycle I go through. Months of it, then a month or so of break, then back to knitting. Right now it's an on cycle, after a month or two of break. Dug out all my half-done projects to work on. I have a yarn stash that I've put myself on a no-buy for, since I have enough to last me a good, long time and I need to knit up/crochet up a few things to lower what I've got held back.

-Stationery, which is, really, a never-ending cycle. I write all the time, but I go through phases of collecting and then giving stuff away to people. I always get things on sale or clearance, or am throwing away old non-working pens. I also do

-fountain pens--which I go through phases of using them every day, then not using them as much, then cleaning them out if they dry up and refilling them. Luckily a single bottle of ink lasts a good, long time and I've collected it all together.

-clothes-currently in a cycle of culling. need to get rid of some dresses and sweaters that I don't wear often enough. Currently I don't have a bursting closet, so it isn't like it used to be, but I am focusing on getting rid of clothing I don't truly love or wear often enough to justify keeping around(that wouldn't cost more to replace, like a coat or bathing suit, should I need it at a moment's notice). But yeah, this goes through cycles as well.

-makeup--recently going through a boom cycle, which is about to reach a more workable level--I used to have the same makeup from like, 5+ years ago, so I've finally gone through, thrown out a lot of it(don't put stuff 5+ years old on your face/eyeballs, mkay?) and replaced anything that needed to be. Eye makeup, especially. But yeah, that's at the tail end of an up-cycle.

-tech. I rebuilt my own desktop earlier this year, I keep wanting a tablet, but I'm waiting to see if I actually get around to finding one for a good price. A friend of mine insists I'd never use it, but I regularly end up wanting to read something and my phone regularly has issues with dying, so I dunno. I don't want a larger phone or a new phone, though.

I'm sure there's others, but eh. Those are my main cycles. Like I said, mostly just focusing on not becoming the adhd hoarder who's always starting some new hobby, buying stuff, then losing interest.

"843","**TL;DR** If you are worried or feel like the symptoms are weighting you down it is ok to get diagnosed. Getting negative result is also a win, so being afraid of that should not stop you. 

Linger version:

Experiencing many of the executive function defects appearing with ADHD is not alien for most people.

Also many of the problems with the executive functions can be result of other conditions. The source can be permanent temporal. For example someone has coined a term ADT to refer adhd-like symptoms caused by modern busy work or digital lifestyle. 

That is why:

- some will claim that it is all normal
- a proper diagnosis is needed to differentiate between normal and abnormal experience
- a proper diagnosis is needed to understand what is causing the trouble with executive function (the conditions are treated in different ways even if many of the symptoms would be similar)

"849","Adderall XR only lasted 5-6 hours for me, not sure why. So first, we tried adding an Adderall 10 mg instant release ""booster"" dose to be taken when needed but that only got me an extra 2 hours or so worth of coverage. 

After that, they had me taking Adderall XR 2x/day - taking the 2nd capsule when the effects from the 1st are pretty much gone. Assuming that this is what u/iknowdanjones also meant in their comment. I believe this was giving me around 10 hours of coverage.

I eventually ditched Adderall XR mainly because the ""ups &amp; downs"" were too pronounced and there were just too many for me while taking 2 per day. Went like this for me: Up from the 1st one's instant release mechanism...start coming down after a bit...then up again when the slow release mechanism kicks in...then after a bit back down again... \*Take capsule #2 for the day\*  Now back up again... then down a bit... then up... then back down until tomorrow... I think you get the point lol

I do believe I metabolize Adderall XR faster than the average person for some reason, but I'm not sure about that. Just have a hunch since one of 'em got me 6 hours coverage maximum, and some people get 8-12 hours from one.

Also I didn't like how Adderall has Levo-Amphetamine mixed in with the Dextro-Amphetamine, pretty much all the Levo does is make the peripheral (mainly physical) side effects more pronounced...yuck.

&amp;#x200B;

I would consider trying Vyvanse instead if thats an option! It lasts me 10-12 hours on average and I only have to take a single dose. It's actually an amphetamine pro-drug that's slowly metabolized \[primarily\] by an enzyme within the liver creating *only* Dextro-Amphetamine, so it ""feels cleaner"" to me, as opposed to Adderall's mixed amphetamines formulation. Also, I get a much more consistent plateau of effects (no ""ups &amp; downs"") throughout its entire duration of action from the enzyme based release mechanism. The other difference is that Vyvanse eases into full effect over the course of around an hour for me instead of hitting immediately (although I've heard the length of ""coming up"" can vary by +/- 30 minutes or so in others) so I just planned my dosing schedule accordingly and I'm golden.

"857","By definition, a disorder does bad things to you. Look up the criteria: if it isn't screwing up at least 2 major parts of your life, what you have is officially not ADD.  
Yeah, I have my fun quirks. But I don't give the disorder credit for those. I don't see any real evidence that my creativity or my personality comes from ADD, except perhaps as coping strategies.  
  
ADD has screwed my life up pretty badly. But there are up sides to that.  
My SO is an accountant. She hates it, she didn't set out to be an accountant, didn't go to school for it. She got started in it because she needed a job, and was trapped by success. She's in her 60's now. Regrets the work, it's sometimes retired but then gets bored and goes back to work, but won't start something else, because if she's going to work, she wants real pay, not starting pay.  
I am in my mid 50's, studying for my 4th career. I am free to do that because I've screwed up the first 3. I learned and grew and enjoyed all of those careers, but I'm glad to be out of each. ADD means I washed out on those careers for reasons that don't disqualify me for whatever comes next.  
My ex wife left me for reasons I now see as ADD issues. Thanks, ADD. That relationship was toxic, but I have a thing about commitment, and I never would have left her.  
  
When I was religious, I had the observation that God sometimes blesses us with an iron fist. ADD is one of those blessings.  
  
So here I am. I like who I am, I like where I am, and ADD is an integral part of both. But ADD sucks anyway.","cuoh67i",2,1441222578,"2015-09-02 19:36:18"

"887","I think I can relate to this.  I feel like I have a giant, ravenous stimulation pig living in my head.  It's not very picky and will eat all kinds of things, but particularly likes new ideas, experiences, facts, interesting conversations and debates, meeting interesting people, learning new things, going to new places, etc., etc.  These can be pretty minor things (e.g. checking out a new neighborhood in my town, meeting an interesting person at a party, discovering a minor but interesting fact, etc.).  As long as the pig is kept well-fed, I'm more-or-less ok, but if life gets routine and I get bored, the pig starts to shrivel up and get cranky.  


Unfortunately, I also have a nasty depression slug in my head.  When the pig is fat and happy, it mostly sits on the slug and keeps it out of the way.  However, when the pig starts to shrivel, the slug can escape and start to take over and push the pig aside.  Sometimes, if I can give the pig a big tasty meal it will puff up and sit on the depression slug again.  If I keep feeding it, it will get bigger and bigger and prevent the slug from getting out.  If I neglect the pig, the slug will take back over quickly.


&gt;Another thing I found is when I need to listen to almost anything, I must keep my hand busy. 

This is me too.  When I talk on the phone at work I either need to take notes or I open a solitaire game on my computer to play while talking.  Otherwise I can't concentrate and will need to get up and pace.  At home I do chores (sweeping, washing dishes, putting stuff away, etc.) while I'm on the phone.  (I guess I should I talk more if I want a clean house!)  If the conversation is particularly heavy, though, I can usually focus on that without the movement.","d7l4ohv",2,1473782795,"2016-09-13 16:06:35"

"891","As a counter perspective to the people telling you to never talk about your meds:  I stopped taking meds about 19 years ago, in college, in large part because of the shaming (from both other ADHDers and non).  I spent 19 years self-medicating with anything I could get my hands on that was socially acceptable—drinking way too much booze and coffee, smoking cigs,  shitty eating habits, herbal supplements, allergy meds, over-exercising to the point of disorder, etc.  During that whole time, I thought of myself as doing great without meds. I finished college, went to a good law school, got married, had two kids, yay me.  But I was living a pretty unhealthy life, was miserable, in every job I tried, had such a hard time with all my relationships, and was not being the parent or partner I wanted to be. It wasn’t until my marriage started falling apart two years ago and I started hearing in therapy about how my symptoms were impacting my spouse that I realized I wasn’t doing all that great.  I was terrified about going back to meds, though, because I had built this whole false identity around the image of myself as a “good” ADHDer who didn’t need meds!! I was very lucky to have a couple of people in my circles who were pretty open about taking meds. Their willingness to do that gave me the courage to at least consider it and get to the doctor.  

With the meds, therapy, and other personal work, everything is 180 degrees SO much better for me now.  I’m so grateful to have medication treatment available as an option. But I’m just as grateful for the community members who were open about their own medication treatment and helped make that less scary for me.  So I try to pay that forward in some ways. I don’t talk about meds at work, but I do in other settings. You should do what is right for you, and you never know if your openness will help someone else in that kind of way.","emjhegh",2,1557030205,"2019-05-05 04:23:25"

For me, the meds were exactly what I needed. I've been taking Dexedrine continuously for the past 6 months, and I've had improvement with nearly everything that I had previously been struggling with. I'm also much more social on it, and I definitely struggled with shyness and introversion when I was younger. Personally, I think this is a battle worth fighting. Even if the meds don't work out, I'd say it's better to try them again and know for sure. Also, getting in to see a psychiatrist could uncover a difference culprit all together. Again, I don't see any harm in trying! 

As for the mistrusting GP, it sounds like it would be in your best interest to try to find a more ADHD positive GP. When you are meeting with new GP's, explain that your previous one was putting up a lot of road blocks and you really just want to meet with a psychiatrist to see if the previously diagnosed ADHD is still a valid diagnoses, or if there is something else at play.

"924","This might sound harsh, but bear with me.

What are you expecting from people? This is a question you need to ask yourself. Do you want them to say, ""yes, it sucks having ADHD,""? Would that be enough for you? Or do you want them to say, ""yes, I know ADHD is hard to deal with. Ok,"" Again you truly need to ask yourself this question.

The thing with illnesses is that at a point we feel the need to fully identify with them, and to bask in the ensuing negativity. At some points it seems easier to just lay down and admit defeat; but it does us more harm than good. And the more people soothe you in when you're negative, the more they encourage you to remain there. All this is mostly subconscious ofc. That's why most people will not give you what you expect of them when you talk about ADHD, because you're unconsciously asking them to assure you that you're a victim and there is no hope for you. And people can't do this for obvious reasons. 

It's important to acknowledge, accept your feelings but it's even more crucial to know when to say ""no"" to them.","d2e598x",2,1461407475,"2016-04-23 10:31:15"

Regardless of whether or not you're taking anything, there are a couple things that I do that help significantly. First of all, set a schedule, and make sure you include breaks for 10-15 minutes. Also, when you're reading, constantly ask yourself what you just read to help you retain the information. Another thing that might help is a reward system. So let's say you finish 10 math problems,  reward yourself for that success. Hope this helps! ","co6wpqx",2,1422727712,"2015-01-31 18:08:32"
"928","Which meds?

With Ritalin, I don't really think my symptoms are worse now if I'm off of it, but I do notice them more easily since I'm getting used to not having them.

With things in the amphetamine family (Adderall, Vyvanse, etc.) I don't have much personal experience. But I have seen other people mention it taking a few weeks to adjust to being off them, and possibly being more fatigued and unmotivated during that period of adjustment.

Different brains respond differently, and it's probably possible for someone to have (or not have) an adjustment period to stopping either class of med. Just like if you quit caffeine or stop taking an antidepressant - if your brain chemistry has adjusted to something, it can take a little while for it to adjust back again after you stop. But I wouldn't worry about it - our brains are very flexible things that adjust themselves for everything from our sleep schedule to our diet, and are constantly readjusting as our circumstances change.

That said, there's still a lot of debate about whether skipping meds on weekends actually does you any good. Some doctors think it's pointless (because it takes longer than that for your brain to adjust back) or even harmful (because you still need to do things like manage your life and safely drive a car on the weekend) but others are still in favor of it. If going unmedicated on the weekends is disruptive to your life, you may want to discuss with your psychiatrist whether they would be willing to extend your prescription to the weekends.","e5d16m6",4,1536038695,"2018-09-04 05:24:55"

"938","Yeah I had to wait 6 months from the moment I started the investigation. I’m 27 and it does feel late. I have two close friends who were medicated from a young age and struggled to get where they are now which is not medicated at all and they have systems that work for them. But it wasn’t necessarily like a switch was flipped. And I know other people who still take theirs and it also works great.

The important thing if you are waiting and earnestly researching you can start to reorganize your life in anticipation of starting a medication. 

The benefit to the medication is when you fuse it with better habits and also when you’re organized and self aware. I know that’s very broad but I took my dose increases very lowly from 5mg to 25mg and as someone who used to be into cocaine and alcohol on a near daily basis this method worked for me. For a lot of habits and organization I was struggling with it helped me overcome the snags I had.

Obviously it’s not absolutely necessary, but if you take a longer time to figure out what’s optimal for you it will be a sustainable and lasting life change. I love the euphoria from amphetamines of course - and finding the right dose of adderall is far preferable than just recreating an amphetamine high. Nothing wrong with doing that either I’m just saying it seems that’s not your aim and neither was it mine. 

It’s really hard though, to get it just right and I see regularly where I live people get written scripts with universities or family doctors who don’t give it enough attention.

"939","Yeah, sorry if I came across as a bit defensive; it's much harder to portray tone in text, but I appreciate the conversation as well.

You're probably far more knowledgeable on the field of neuroscience than I am, seeing as how my area of focus is cancer biology; my favorite way to put it is, I know enough about neuroscience and psychology to get myself in trouble. xD

But yeah, so we're probably of similar age (I was born in 1990) from the sound of it and both grew up with technology. You've said lots that I personally agree with and lots of things that science has validated. Just a quick summary:

* Yes, you are correct that lifestyle can and, as far as we can validate, does affect your neurochemistry. Though, to be fair, quite literally almost everything does, but there have been peer-reviewed studies that show that meditation and mindfulness can improve one's quality of life across a few different metrics (forgive me, I don't have links to these articles, but could fish around on request). Hence, why it's often recommended for people with ADHD as it helps us hone the skill of focus.

* There are people that abuse ADHD drugs, I don't think anyone on this sub will argue with you on this one man. It sucks, and I really *really* wish there was a better way of diagnosing ADHD. Heck, I tried to come up with tests to convince myself that I wasn't just being lazy before I even started talking to doctors. They put me through a battery of tests as well (in all it took about 2 months to go from first doctor visit to 1st prescription), which I personally was grateful for because I needed to convince myself that I wasn't just trying to ""take the easy way out"". So yeah man, I'd love to see a scan, blood panel, or any ***quantitative*** test that would say ""yeah man, you gots the ADHDs pretty bad.""

* You also mention the negative side effects of the drugs that most people don't realize or talk about. Man, I'm right there with you. I've been on a lower dose of Adderall for almost 2 years now and while it has been an immense help, I pay a heavy price for it. I'd love to talk to you in PMs about your experience with Vyvanse, because I'm starting to consider long-term treatment options. Ideally, yeah, I'd love to figure something out that doesn't require medication, but as some of the other people in this thread have mentioned, I've tried everything I could find to help and only the medication was effective enough. Now I'm not saying there's *not* techniques or lifestyle changes that would yield the same results (basically, what you were getting at when you asked us to find a ""lasik"" option). I can only speak personally, but I searched for at least a year on the internet and tried every procrastination and focus technique I could find with minimal improvement. 

* The only point that I'm not sure I totally agree with is technology aggravating ADHD symptoms. In my mind, this can be interpreted a few different ways, so here are my thoughts and correct me where I'm wrong:

&gt; I think technology aggravates our symptoms of ADHD to make us think our personal situations, with regards to attention, focus, and motivation, are much more dire than they really are. &lt;

1) The statement suggests that technology exacerbate the condition by training people to have a decreased attention span. I've heard this hypothesis before, though I can't say I agree with it. If I'm not mistaken, it relies on the principle that constant barrages of ""rewards"" (text message/Facebook/Twitter/Instagram notifications, Likes/Updoots, Memes, etc.) trains our brains to seek out the easy dopamine hits, much like drugs. I can certainly see how it would be possible, but I think this is more of technology adapting to biology than the inverse (i.e. - companies design their tech. to exploit your biology to make you want to keep using their tech.). The ""flood of stimuli"" that you refer to could also extend to tradition information (journal articles, wikipedia articles, scientific critiques, etc.). I'll agree with you that you could easily get overwhelmed with the amount of information you take in if you want. The internet has given our generation immediate access to more information than any other generation; we very well may have access to more information than all other generations combined. But I'd argue that we're selective about the information we choose to take in and filter the rest out. Even though we have access to decades of Nature articles, how many people do you see pouring over them? :P

2) The statement could also be read as, ""technology gives us access to online groups &amp; social platforms that don't accurately portray the real world."" Ok, here I wholeheartedly agree. You could argue that I could have a pre-Med friend on Facebook that only posts about how many hours they spend in the library studying. If all you saw were posts like ""8h of studying for this OChem exam and I still don't feel prepared,"" you could get really down on yourself for not being able to study more than 1-2h at a time, when in reality, the pre-Med person could be spending 1-2h *actually* studying and the other 6-7h on Facebook in the library. You also have the problem of niche groups giving a false perception of popularity/prevalence. We probably see this a lot on reddit with this and other sub-reddits. I'd be willing to say that most people on this sub have ADHD, which could make you think it's a common problem, and if a neurotypical person came here it might not be that hard to convince themselves that they have ADHD too given how common it appears to be and how common the symptoms seem to be (though neurotypical people experience these issues to a much lesser extent).

**TL;DR** - So yeah, sorry for the novel, but in summary, I agree with you on most points and really like the conversation. I'd love to work towards treatment that didn't include meds, but right now they seem like the best option even when you factor in the (sometimes brutal) side effects.

"942","Things that help:

* Mild OCD about the little things. I've never lost my wallet. I always know where my keys are. My phones look good after years of constant use. Worrying about the little things helps. Creates some structure you can rely on.
* Occasionally let the shit hit the fan. Being in a true emergency helps clear the mind and turns on hyperfocus. I offer my clients the kind of deadlines, which make me work hard, because I don't want to lose face. ""Arrange"" some emergencies for yourself to test your limits. Then ""arrange"" your schedule so as to work on the very edge. Soon you will discover that you're better at some task than anyone else you know of.
* External motivators work, but you gotta set them up yourself. I've started some high-profile non-profits to fight societal problems that I care about. Nothing motivates better than knowing that if you don't do something, nobody else will either, and therefore bad things will happen.
* Headphones, loud music. Noise will distract your brain enough so that you can focus on the task at hand. My current go-to bands: Brains, Recoil, Daft Punk, High Contrast.
* Don't marinate all by your lonesome. Discuss your tasks with someone. Such discussions help you work through the anxiety that's stopping you and will also help you get interested in the task.
* Small wins will help you reach the big wins. One successful task at a time.

What you need to be doing is learning to work around your problems and using your peculiarities as your strengths. This means learning to understand yourself thoroughly. Know thyself and you will win every battle.","c989gur",1,1365069344,"2013-04-04 09:55:44"

If my daughter says “I want blah-blah-blah in my lunches” I will never in a million years remember it unless I stop everything and write it down. So this app is a list that categorizes groceries as you input them (nice labeling system, love it) AND BEST PART: I can share it with someone else.

Basically, it's no good if the reminder can be sent away before I've actually done the thing.

"993","STORY OF MY LIFE. I feel like I have so many interests, and never know what direction to go in. The things I enjoy doing, I don't bother doing because if I cant be the best, then why bother? I'm at the point where for the past 4-5 years, I have no hobbies (I'm 24). I no longer paint, draw, do web design, photography... all because I wasn't confident enough in my abilities, and at the same time had other interests.

Career-wise, I don't have a clue. I could see myself being an office manager, accountant, elementary school teacher, nurse, stay at home mother... the list goes on. I couldn't make my mind up, and didn't put in the effort, so I quit going to community college. Now that I'm going back in January and now and taking medication, I still don't know what career to seek. 

I wish I could give you advice, but I'm in the same boat. My father has always told me that no matter what, I probably wont like my job. I'll see the people around me and wish I had their job, but then if I had it I wouldn't like it. In the long run you have to do what makes the most financial sense, career wise. For hobbies, I think you have to buckle down and do what you think is most beneficial for you and will help you grow as a person. I'm taking my dad's advice and trying to put it into action, but its hard.

If you are trying to figure out what type of degree or career to pursue, this is what I would do. Make a list of things you think you would like. Figure out what their job security is and average salary, and then how long it takes to complete a degree and write that all down. You've gotta narrow down things with logic. What pays the most? What has the most job security? Which is easiest to find a job with? Which will be more beneficial when I have a family of my own? Those questions point me straight towards nursing. Pays very well, good schedule, high demand, and we will always need nurses! Logic is your friend.","cdf1uru",6,1384535825,"2013-11-15 17:17:05"

"999","Interesting to see this topic because I have just booked myself in to see a doctor in regards to getting diagnosed with ADHD however I am pretty certain that I am also undergoing a bout of depression.

As it stands, I hate my job and the work I do and unfortunately the career path I have chosen which is making it really hard for me to find a new job, or even to become enthusiastic about any of the job offerings I am suitable for because to me they are all tripe. So instead I feel like I am staying stuck in this job I am in because I know in the other offerings I'll feel exactly the same way so what I really want to do is retrain to get a job doing something I can feel passionate about but of course that comes down to money and time of which I have neither.

However, then there is the latter, the things I love doing. My hobbies, my passions and the things that if I didn't have 8 hours of my job to endure that I would actually have a reason to get out of bed for - however I have so many that I don't ever find the time to be able to fit them all in because most of the waking hours during a weekday I have spent sat behind a computer wishing the day away.

So, I am undiagnosed in ADHD and Depression but I am personally pretty certain that I have both at this point in time.

Before realising that I had mad a massive mistake with my chosen career path I would have said that I just had ADHD - however after suffering through 6 years of work in my chosen industry I believe I have both right now.

"1043","I work 48 hours a week, but it’s condensed into two 24hr workdays, with three days off in between..for a while I was working a second job to fill that time working 9-6 so I was only getting one day off a week, which I did not want to spend being productive! After realizing that 10 hours of OT with my main job equates to my months salary at the side job, I decided I wasn’t going to burn myself out anymore! So now the three days between work days I have my day to day tasks that I do (laundry, cooking, loading the dishwasher, etc) then each week I’ll set a goal to accomplish one “larger” task (hanging a tv, reorganizing a closet, getting rid of old clothes) and every so many days I take a day to do nothing, but either way the days I am doing things I’ll reward myself ...dishwasher unloaded and reloaded ✔️..now in going to play some Xbox or watch a few episodes of this and by the time 6pm rolls around I usually call it quits...

I find this is great from overdoing it and by keeping on top of it like this if you have an unplanned day where you wake up and feel like you can’t do anything...you don’t have to!

"1045","I don't have any fancy degrees or nuffin. All I got is muh experiences as a Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Counsellor, a Mental Health patient assistant, and a person who was diagnosed a month ago.

In my wayward youth I had occasion to try some commonly available stimulants at a party or maybe clubbing, I struggle to recall the night before I tried it. Afterwards is clear as day though. I excused myself, found my way home, cleaned my kitchen and made a tray of cookies and did my taxes for the year.

Later, when working in a locked mental health ward, a woman about 30 was brought in after causing a... Kerfuffle... Yeah. On a flight to her wedding destination. She'd been using dexedrine 10mg bought off ye olde Silk Rode to help her slim down before the nuptials. She was admitted, seen to, sent to sleep, seen to again after a good night's sleep and some food, as well as some investigations with her family and husband-to-be. No history of scatteredness, no family history of interest, no propensities towards Kerfufflement. She was sent on her way, deeply embarrassed and apologetic to her Kerfuffle victims.

And finally a AOD person I knew of. Severe childhood trauma which had caused mental health problems well into their 30's, treatments for depression and mood would work for 2-3 months then collapse and cause acute decomposensation and almost inexorably to suicidal behaviours without ideation. One of his treatment team got creative and an ADHD diagnosis was proffered. The medication was trialled for a week. No relief and caused another decomposensation episode.

Now, all of this is to give context to this: your results may vary.

"1050","No, I'm sorry, but you fucked up the tone :/ 

I am generally interested in people that have achieved success despite this disorder. Cus when I look at it, it isn't that bad, and yet, it is that bad. Because when I look at who I am, well, I am a very motivated to succeed individual. And for my age, I am pretty successful all things considered. Despite already being successful, I recognize that for long term success, I will need to constantly work on communication, focus, and drive. Those are three things that ADHD basically screws over. So while I am very grateful that I do not constantly live in the gloom of depression, I am a bit saddened that I have a disadvantage in all the areas that I need to make myself successful.

So yea, seeing people who have overcome these tribulations help me. When I looked at the list I was especially pleased to see Richard Branson and Justin Timberlake. Because A) I am going to be studying entrepreneurship (something that I have already done for years), and well, Richard Branson sort of has that down pat. I am also a filmmaker, and Justin Timberlake, well, he is a bit of an entertainment guru. So it is nice to see that in my two major fields of operations there are ADHD giants.

But at least it has a happy advantage: I can listen to music in my head. I remember every little bit of details, every single notes. (despite this, I'm completely unable to sing, play any instruments or dance...)

Instead of getting annoyed and fighting it, learn to control it.

I'm dealing this forever, and while ""turning off"" is still not easy, I can ""switch station"" so at least I can listen songs I like.

The constant background music provided by subconsciousness is advantageous many times in situations where listening real music is not possible.

Stimulants are highly restricted due to their abuse potential, but there are other treatments for ADHD.

It may be easier for you to access something like Strattera in the meantime, which is significantly less restrictive, but certainly help various people with ADHD.

Of course it is important to get your diagnosis right, as the wrong diagnosis could worsen your situation.

I understand lots of schools today keep that stuff online, but I imagine your parents still have access to however they were given the reports to begin with. You could also try asking the school for the report cards, if you don't have them, just for your own edification. I'm fairly sure  report cards would be considered your/your parents' property. 

Who is your appointment with? It sounds like you already set one up without teachers, so... /shrug. If that's the case it can totally be your choice whether or not teachers know. You wouldn't necessarily need special care or anything, especially at your age. I can only imagine that being an issue if you are given a stimulant drug that requires daily boosters, because they probably don't want kids walking around carrying highly abused drugs that they self-administer several times a day. They might want you to keep your medications with the nurse. 

I don't know for sure, though. I recall a few kids in my high school who were on Adderall or whatnot that weren't given any special care or classes or anything. Those types of things would have to be requested, I think. 

But I've also never heard of a kid seeking a diagnosis that didn't involve their school. I'm 100% certain you have classmates that have private issues that you don't know about and the school does. 

My mother did the observer report with me, and I think going through it together actually opened her eyes to things about me. It's okay if their reports don't 100% portray you accurately, either.

"1089","You're tapping into a larger more dynamic issue, and that's a discussion for another time.

The institution that currently promotes standardize testing in my opinion, is [harmful and dangerous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JVVRWBekYo).

"1093","Like... we ADHDers also have motor skill difficulties though. How much is ""motor skill on a neural level"" and how much is ""I forgot what I was doing whilst doing it"" is hard to say, but we do have motor problems.

In the example of the bottle, working out and maintaining the right angle for a steady pour is awful when we can't see the fluid flowing. 

We can also start stimming with the wrong object and hurt ourselves clicking a stapler over and over til we staple our thumb.

We can change grip strength whilst holding something and squash or drop it. I have lost many eggs and cups of drink to that problem. 

We can ""oversynchronise"" or ""de synchronise"" our hands  so they start doing the same thing when they are supposed to do different things, and vice versa. 

We can react slowly to pain, and continue to cut/burn/squash ourselves for longer than someone without ADHD would.

We do have motor issues. And that's OK as long as we are happy and able to handle them.

When fatigued, it seems my brain is less active. Depending on fatigue level and/or issue I'm dealing with, this can results in either:

(1) New thoughts pop up slower, giving some time in between to actually think about that single thought a bit longer.

(2) Thinking goes very slow but seem more to be in a straight line. Thoughts are not all over the place, not analyzing every possible way of doing something, not analyzing every possible outcome of a decision.

Order one from Amazon immediately (well three hours later because I can’t just have notifications on my phone unread, but I can’t just delete emails without at least seeing if I need to buy something , and then there’s that snack I was going to make).
Nightstand comes the next day, which is great, because now I can unpack (right after I finish making the three course dinner snack I found the new recipe for yesterday).
Okay, so now it’s tomorrow , but at least I had the snack. Let me just move the nightstand box from the door to the closet so it’s out of the way, so I can clean the area. Wait there’s a box already in the closet ... what’s this? 
The other nightstand ...that I thought I sold...but where did the $50 bucks come from? Now I have two nightstands? 
I could sell them both... or I could go on Pinterest and see what I can do with two nightstands in a room....
2 months later , my life is disorganized and in shambles ... I should start by cleaning my room, this way I can do that work project due on Monday with no distractions.
Swear I had two nightstands somewhere in the house. Time to search each box of unpacked clothing for my organization outfit. Can’t organize without a cute outfit .
I found it, but I thought it was red , but it’s clearly blue... wtf? Who buys a blue organization outfit?
I now spend 3 hours researching the psychology of colour. I then realize that the nightstands I bought should be white, not black... I should sell them...or paint them...10 YouTube videos later I know now how to repaint nightstands....
OMG, it’s 3am ...I swear there is something important about Monday...

We shouldn't look at accommodations and medications as giving us an advantage, but rather bringing us up to par with everyone else. Now, in some cases, those of us with ADHD may be really quite smart, and we've had to develop coping mechanisms that have helped us get by pretty well without accommodations and meds. But when we do finally get a diagnosis, and we start taking meds, our ""potential"" can finally be unlocked and we might actually be able to really excel in our jobs or at school. Because of this it may feel like we are getting an unfair advantage, but seriously we shouldn't think of it as a competition. I feel very fortunate that I have ADHD and I feel fortunate that I finally got a diagnosis after going to college. Sometimes I wish I had learned about it sooner, but then I wouldn't have all of this great experience to help me when things get really tough. (I am also trying to write a book about my experience, so I guess if I get to do that, then I'm pretty dang lucky).

If not, it's a way of determining if one idea is worth devoting more time to. If you can limit yourself to 0.5 or 1 hour, and list the benefits and costs on a single page, it can give you a quick idea whether there's value following up on it. It doesn't need perfect structure. Just capture everything you can imagine that's important about the idea. Even if it goes nowhere, you can file it away with other ideas when you need some quick brainstorming (or have thoughts that come back to it).

As an engineer, I do this a lot at work when I'm feeling the need to be creative, but ensure I'm spending my time wisely on projects I've committed to. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to my ideas notebook because some conversation about a new project need triggered a previous crazy idea that would be perfect (with the right feedback from another engaged person).

"1156","I'm 27 and I was diagnosed maybe 2 months ago. I have had repeated freak outs, leaving courses right when they get stressful or the pace gets to fast and have always regretted it. Every-time the situation has been less dire than I felt and although I would have gotten a terrible grade, most of the time I would have passed and been done with that unit. I'm maybe 3 years (at least) behind were **I** should be, it took me a long time to accept that I shouldn't compare myself to the performance of others and just work towards what I want.

As studying seems be your big issue at the moment, all I can do is explain what would've helped me.

Meditate for 10 minutes, every-time you get distracted (the distracted when you go down the totally wrong path) or can't make yourself work, sit down and meditate. I prefer zen meditation as the sitting positions are a little uncomfortable which helps me bring my mind back to the real world. It's not about some inner peace shit. You can't control your own mind, so exercising what little control you have will help. Try to focus on something unrelated and not a source of emotion. Yes you will suck at this, horrifically, but the act of trying may be enough to get you through this paper.

Structure, people with ADHD diagnosed in adulthood often first realize something is wrong when they enter into an environment in which they must create the structure themselves. Make structure, create a plan, whatever plan you can. Be realistic and don't judge yourself to harshly when you realize you can't truly follow through.

White-noise. Every sound, sight ect, is registering with you whether you know it or not. Use a background sound (rain falling or whatever) with headphones if you have them, to drown everything else out.

Calm the fuck down. You have just been diagnosed, you aren't a miracle worker and frustration will only make your symptoms worse. You still have time to improve and deal with yourself, this is 1 paper out of many. Some you will manage to prepare better, many you wont, but accept that failures come and go, especially academic ones.

p.s. chill about the doctor, odds are they want you on medication, ADHD is one of the few conditions that responds consistently well to meds. Communicate that you have reached a point academically in which you can't continue without a normal capacity to focus.","d4yd7tr",2,1467600123,"2016-07-04 02:42:03"

But I've been able to get out of bed easier and haven't really been sad I guess. But I also feel a bit emotionally blunted. I'm hoping it's all just an adjustment period, because I know when I first started a higher dose of Lexapro it made me feel kinda almost drunk for a week or two and then it went away.

First I move baking ingredients into a deep drawer (after humming and hawing over practicality vs predictability). Then I move dishes to fit preserves in another cupboard. Eventually I clear three shelves and start moving the liquor over. Unfortunately only the top shelf is tall enough for many of my bottles. I try to do a real ""top shelf"", but the cheap stuff has to go somewhere.

tl;dr: I ate at 9pm and did no music. ","ea320ok",3,1542690969,"2018-11-20 05:16:09"

"1166","Hi.

I was prescribed Methylphenidate weeks ago. I started with a very extended release of Methylphenidate 30mg (30% immediate and 70% extended release). And... I didn’t feel any euphoria or anything like that. Well, at least I didn’t identify it like that, but rather as anxiety. Also I didn’t find any benefit either. Maybe it was a too low dose, or maybe it was too extended in time, I don’t know.

I had to stop because it was giving me a higher heartbeat and increased my diastolic blood pressure from 7.2 to 8.5. And being extended release, after 12 hours I still felt my heart pumping hard. After that episode I went to the cardiologist to check my heart, and told me I have a healthy heart, but I have to be careful with this meds because it is normal to raise the heartbeat... I’m not sure if I will be able to continue taking it when I’m older, 40-45 or even 50 years old, because my heart won’t be as young as it is now. That’s a concern I have, because my ADHD won’t go away. And from what I’ve read, Strattera gives the same heart issues...

But it is good to know that, at least, the good effects don’t wear off. I have my next appointment in a week, and my doctor told me we will try with an immediate release form of Methylphenidate this time. Hopefully I will have the heart side effects only during the day.

Thanks for creating this post and sharing your knowledge /u/ricar321 /u/culturallystunted  I just hope to find that life-changing molecule, and here Vyvanse and similar stimulant meds are rarely prescribed (I’m not even sure they are approved), only Methylphenidate or Atomoxetine.","fcz64zs",2,1578094447,"2020-01-03 23:34:07"

"1190","&gt;and I also daydream a bit and so I’ve ended up practicing my conversational skills a lot that way. It’s made a big difference.

Yes, I've found my daydreaming to be a god send when preparing for a presentation or talk I have to do.  One of the few benefits of ADHD.

And they always go down well, people have even told me I'm a natural at presentations, but I don't think they realise how rehearsed my presentations actually are.  Not that I memorise anything word for word, that would be a terrible idea especially for me, but because I'm breaking the presentation up with jokes and stories that I've thought about while I've been daydreaming in the days leading up to the presentation, it might sound in those moments that I'm talking off the cuff and going slightly off script, but that is definitely not the case, it's all been planned during my daydreaming moments.

And believe me, I'm a terrible conversationalist, I 'um' and  'err' with the best of them, I'm constantly getting flummoxed when I do actually have to speak off the cuff, and doing presentations used to put the fear of God into me, but as you say, practice is the key.  Practice gives you confidence, confidence lowers your cortisol levels, lower cortisol levels reduces anxiety, and lower anxiety levels will contribute to a more fluid speech.  

I'm trying to apply this to other situations, like when I go on dates, and it's going pretty well, although there will always be points when I get flummoxed but it gets easier to brush over the more confident you are, and to be honest,  I just see getting flummoxed now and again as part of who I am.  

And if anyone thinks that stumbling over your words is a barrier to being a good talker, then just listen to the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, the guy is CONSTANTLY stumbling over his words, yet he managed to become and PM and most people seem to regard him as a pretty good speaker (even if they might not like the guy), ironically because he's always stumbling over his words it seems to add a bit of authenticity to his interviews and stuff, so people tend to listen rather than switch off.","fw1o37n",1,1593163106,"2020-06-26 09:18:26"

Skipping a night of sleep is what she calls her “reset.”  

It doesn’t fix things of course, but she says it helps. When everything works against, maybe things pile up, and it’s winter, and she’s doing her best, and her meds and therapies just aren’t resulting in much, she says it helps a lot to stay up 36 hours. Watch movies or take walks or bake... whatever it takes to not go to bed that night, then just power through the day. Then go to bed at a reasonable hour (not too early). She said it helps her a lot. 

I tried it this summer when I was struggling and had a place to myself one night. Not sure what it did exactly but I think it helped.

"1195","I've got my diagnose at 33yo and felt similar. Fortunatelly I have a very good psychiatrist, who suggested exploring all of the avenues - meds, adhd tips and strategies and therapy (CBT to be exact).

I honestly can't understand how sb, even a psychotherapist, can take a glance at you and tell you with all of the confidence what will work. If that was possible, life would be easier for everybody.

Undiagnosed ADHD often comes with a lot of emotional issues and it seems it's the case for you as well. Find the medical team (psychiatrist and therapist/couch) which is supportive and oriented on helping you get progressively better, not looking into a cristal ball. If you feel like therapy could work for you, at least give you a safe place to get it all out, go for it. I don't think there is a lot of bad that can come from talking to a specialist about whatever issues you are struggling with, adhd related or not. In my experience CBT/DBT is actually helpful as it's more oriented on dealing with what comes up now than going into a deep analysis of your past. A good therapist will take you back to your childhood if they deem it helpful, even with CBT. I personally decided to choose the specialists I can trust and then just trust the process.

Everybody is different, try different things and you will find what works for you. It can get easier. And better. Even in a relatively short amount of time.","gmtw82n",2,1612973826,"2021-02-10 16:17:06"

It's just a matter of finding the right doc who will listen to you and work with what you need. 

Don't be afraid to ask your therapist for a letter of support telling your doctor about your diagnoses. Most doctors are responsive to letters from therapists, and it creates a feeling of safety for them in prescribing controlled substances like stimulant ADD medicatioin. Many doctors are wary of prescribing those things because of how tightly regulated they are. Also, try and keep an open mind about what will work for you treatment-wise. You never know until you try.

"1202","I am my opinions. To not be allowed, or be denied, either out of fear of not getting friends, or fear of not being accepted for who you are, what many TED talks teach me, is self-defeating compromise. All these successful people are rich, famous and respected *because* they chose to do thing differently.

My favorite quote is by Robert Frost. ""Two road diverge in a wood. And I, I took the one less traveled by. And that has made all the difference."" I memorized this as a kid. Because it resonated with me. 

If I cannot be respected or be disliked, or shunned because I have an opinion, then I am not the one with a problem, am I? It is them that abuse me to strengthen the bonds between like minded people, who may or may not actually agree with me but are too scared to be banished from the social group. 

I rather be a recluse than to kneel down just to be liked. I cannot do it. If I do that then nothing of what makes me. me, will remain. All my experiences and problem and setbacks, all the little successes I have, the fact I see things others simply cannot or refuse to, all that is me. I cannot distinct between my ideas and my principles and moral aptitude d myself.

It seems here too I identify the issue: to separate between the self and your ideas seems folly not me. All you do is pander to a non-norm of social fluidity , you become a nothing-burger, a tasteless wanna-be-loved that hurts his own morality, sacrifices principles just because you need a tit to suck on if you ask me.

No, I cannot do it. Kill me if I must. All I have going for me is what my brain still allows me to be aware of. A unique perspective, my own Theory Of Everything. No friendship is worth sacrificing that.

"1227","Forgive me for saying this but based on the comments I've seen from you, your response to nearly EVERY suggestion has been ""I can't do this because..."" and ""That won't work because..."" My takeaway from that line of thinking is that you really *are* just hoping everything will work itself out, because you've already more or less decided that no action you take could ever possibly help.

Dude, this is a subreddit full of people with ADHD. We are the absolute worst at finally taking action without making excuses and avoiding it first. That shit ain't gonna fly here.

So, question: In the past when you tried what I suggested, what happened? How did you go about it exactly? Did it help temporarily? Was this before or after your second kid? Before or after the PPD diagnosis? Before or after you started classes?

You have to understand that we really REALLY do want to help you - the happiness of four people is at stake here. We don't want to talk down to you. We don't want to abuse you for doing something wrong (we ALL know how that shit feels). But we do all see that you're making excuses because you don't want to change the way you've always done things. You don't think you should have to.

And, by rights, no, you shouldn't have to. But marriage means being there for each other. She's not there for you right now because she FEELS like you're not there for her (even if her feelings are an inaccurate interpretation of reality). Even when things calm down, she will remember how she felt during this patch of time. She will remember feeling like you weren't stepping up enough. She will NOT remember that she was too picky about how she wanted things done. She will NOT remember that she was irrational. And even after things get easier, she will be resentful and distant.

I mean, fair enough - If you've given up, you've given up. You certainly don't HAVE to try anything we suggest.

But if you haven't given up, then please JUST listen to this one piece of advice, if NOTHING else:

Ease. Your wife's. Anxiety. By ANY MEANS NECESSARY. (And as you're already aware, appealing to logic isn't going to do it.)

You appear to have a lot of pride getting in the way of your taking any action though. *Your wife is already technically doing less than you if you look at the bullet points, right? So why should you do anything more? Why should HER PPD be YOUR problem, after all, your ADHD isn't HER problem, right?* I get that. I TOTALLY get that. And I can really, really relate to that. But you know what? My past relationships - not just romantic, but friendships and work relationships and even some familial bonds - have fallen apart because I had that ""I shouldn't have to"" mindset. So, y'know, use that information how you will.

Stop just waiting and hoping. And for heaven's sake, stop looking for solace in accounts from people with single child households, or households where both spouses have ADHD and truly understand each other, or households with no PPD. Those aren't helpful for you. 

The people in this thread who had similar problems &amp; came out the other side are ALL the ones who DID SOMETHING, have you noticed that? Because I haven't seen you reply to any of them with ""Thanks"" or ""I hadn't thought of that"" or ""How do you recommend I go about that"" or ANYTHING signaling a willingness on your part to try something new.

I mean, look at your situation. You both consciously KNOW what the root causes of your irrationality are. But that knowledge alone is fixing nothing. It doesn't matter that you each KNOW the other person's feelings are unwarranted, that you each KNOW you're both working hard. You still feel resented (and resentful), and she still feels overwhelmed. KNOWING that maybe you're not actually a lazy ass and KNOWING that her control freak tendencies are rooted in PPD and anxiety is not making anyone *feel* any better.

And that's the key here, dude - YOU NEED TO MAKE YOUR WIFE FEEL BETTER, or nothing will ever improve. She needs to do the same for you, yes, I'm not denying that. But she doesn't have the presence of mind for that right now. You do, so you have to start. She'll catch up later.

That is, of course, if you haven't given up. But that one's on you.","d51s5up",11,1467832726,"2016-07-06 19:18:46"

3. As you are naturally lacking in the attentive-listening department, you need to heavily overcompensate elsewhere: show your affection often, in imaginative ways. Make sure that every day you do something that makes her life easier or feel special. Use the creativity, need for novelty and spontaneity that are part of ADHD to her advantage.

"1244","Out of the side effects you've mentioned, the only thing I really get is loss of appetite which I control fine. I don't get headaches or nausea unless I take way over which I almost never do. I have a regime in the morning where I eat breakfast as early as I can, which is around 7:15am, and I wait until around 9am to take my first dose. I will try dosing on an empty stomach if I'm switched to XR's from IR's I suppose. I think a bigger reason as to why I sometimes stray from eating too much is the fear of the meds wearing off (I only bring what my daily dosage is so I don't get tempted to take another).


I was trying to avoid upping my dosage because hitting a tolerance plateau (I am pretty stim resistant) but I think I will ask about it next time I see my doctor. It's just that theres so many people who are in the 50-60mg range without feeling much and that alone scares me. I'm starting to think XR might be the way to go since I don't have to stress about dosing, such as making sure to wait at least an hour after I eat to take my next dosage. I think that itself is creating anxiety for me making it hard to concentrate sometimes. 

Regarding having the medications spaced too far apart, I know exactly what you mean. I realized that sometimes taking an extra 10mg ir in the late afternoon after i've had 20mg already during the morning, it does next to nothing for me. I don't know if the overlapping effect has anything to do with making the meds more effective but I almost feel like theres a certain ""momentum"" if you will. such as taking 30mg 1 hour apart will last much longer for me than taking 20mg first, and then waiting until the meds wear off completely to take another 10. I feel like you need much more to get that momentum started again.

I can relate to being too scared to act and talk because the people around. Inside, I have tons of energy, I would be able to talk for hours without getting tired, and I feel the need to act on impulses yet, I supressed acting on these feelings because of the thought of being judged. I used to be my true self around my closed friends but can't even do that anymore because we now see each other quite rarely. I kept things in for so long that I now don't know how to act around people anymore. I have no idea how to start a conversation or how to keep one going. Especially if it's about small talk (which I hate, but sometimes is necessary).

And I have all that energy bottled inside.

The frustrating part is that consciously I don't give a dime on what people think. Yet, I'm somehow scared of it. I didn't managed to understand how this works yet.

I'm sorry to hear you are experiencing bad days. And unfortunately I don't know how to get you out of it. But I suggest you focus on paying attention to your feelings and what is triggering your anxiety and bad mood. Than you can learn how to act on those causes and make them better.

Yes. In fact, my mother went around and met another psychiatrist *for me*, **without me**. And that psych tried to tell her that I had anxiety as a result of not being able to live up to people's expectations. Fucker - that's because I'm *not able to*.

IMHO, just find another psychiatrist. I don't care if my doctor tries me on other plans before diagnosing me with a disorder, but I just want someone to listen - which my other therapist was very bad at. 

I've been on medication for less than a month, and I can already feel my life turning around, with some effort. I'm finally able to concentrate on things I want, I feel more normal - if that makes any sense.

IMHO - if you feel like your psychiatrist is a bad listener or is discounting the very existence of a disorder, it may be time to find another. Just don't overdo it and look for one who will roll with whatever you think.

"1279","I can empathize - I have ADHD, Mrs. Smith has autism. It turns out that I have the majority of the chores. I do ask her for help.

I strongly recommend phrasing things using the I, not you construction. For example, I am tired and I need help with the housework. Can you help with dinner? Or, I feel hurt when you get defensive about helping with the housework.

So, you may already know that some people with ADHD experience rejection sensitive dysphoria. They can be very sensitive to things they perceive as criticism. I know I've had to work on this with Mrs. Smith, and it's definitely taken me a while to get to a point where I don't feel like everything's a veiled criticism! (It does help that in her case, because of autism, it is very hard for her to make veiled criticisms; she will either criticize me up front or not at all.)

That said, your BF does need to get a handle on RSD. It is completely within bounds for partners to divide the chores. You can choose to take on a greater burden, on account of your BF's impairment. But that doesn't mean he gets to leave it all to you. He has to chip in. He also has to learn to hear that honey, I need some help with dinner **does not mean** honey, you're a fuckup.

It sounds like you do need a sit down conversation about the division of labor.

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

Because of my distractability, I made sure never to switch to a smartphone.  When I got my phone, Verizon still carried one dumb phone model.  Not sure what the selection is like right now for any of the carriers.  Your carrier may still offer a dumb phone, but you'll have to be strong with the salesperson, because they may want to sell you a smartphone.  If that doesn't work I would actually ask family and friends if they have any dumb phones laying around that you can use - I feel like everyone has a drawer with a couple of old flip phones in it from when they switched to smart phones.

and all the pain im in now physically on top of the years of mental suffering, couldve all been avoided if she had just tried the test. my brother also never got tested when he should have and found out he has autism at 20 years old so im assuming his mental stress has probably been much worse than mine.

I was not diagnosed with nor treated for ADHD at that time and in hindsight I'm not sure if an ADHD brain played a role in those decisions...though I did love the ""high"" or perhaps dopamine hit from a good praise session or prayer session...

"1304","Severity, and pervasiveness.

It’s normal to lose your keys occasionally. Completely and utterly normal. You would be hard pressed to find someone who hadn’t ever forgotten their keys.

It’s ADHD when the exception is **not** losing something.

It’s normal to miss homework, it’s not to miss **every** single one, even though you really do try and care.

The pervasiveness thing is more subtle and much more often overlooked. If someone has been misdiagnosed with ADHD - I’d absolutely bet this is the key factor that was missed.

ADHD isn’t selective. This seems obvious. But it’s not always mentioned or considered. If something is selective, that can mean that the particular area they succeed in is very ADHD friendly (and even then they way in which they succeed should be quite characteristic), but otherwise, there is usually another reason.

One kid never does their homework because they have ADHD - upon investigation ADHD will probably effect every area in their lives or at least things relating to their subtype.

Another kid doesn’t do their homework because they go home to an abusive family, or they go and work so they can help pay the bills to eat. Other things take precedence, usually with good reason. However, most of the things like this won’t be so pervasive as ADHD. Once the starving family were able to get government support, and food stamps, the kid was suddenly able to get their homework done. When the kid in this family is in school they’re an attentive and decent student without any signs of ADHD. Their problems are strictly outside of school.

This makes ADHD difficult to diagnose, especially when the psychiatrist/whoever errs too far on either side, either attributing real ADHD to non-existent environmental things or to other problems (I was first diagnosed with Aspergers, and while I am a nerd with less than perfect social skills, Aspergers isn’t what I have, I have ADHD-PI) or where ADHD is diagnosed and medicated for everything that vaguely looks like it, regardless of other features.

That is really the difference. Without meds I either massively hyperfocus - (I read war and peace in one sitting, I’m not joking), or I can’t focus on anything at all, even if I want to.

I get the best of daily attention in feeding and checking up on stuff, plus weekly to monthly long-term maintenance.

I also like to put positive attention towards my friends that listen to me: ""thanks for letting me vent out all my excitement, you're fantastic for listening!"" Making sure that not every conversation is centered on you is also imperative.

Another thought to consider: do you have RSD? Your classmates may not be as negative about your interests as you believe them to be. If they know you have ADHD it may be a good idea to check in and say ""hey, I've been feeling bad about how much I can't stop talking about xxx, please understand I'm trying to tone it down a little""

You are in a bad spot and I know most advice like ""do exsercise"" or ""do just one thing"" are not bad advice, but not anything that will get you out of your current state of mind or practical situation.

My advice is to talk to people, any people, break the isolation you're in. Get feedback from people about yourself and hear of other people's struggles, both strangers, professionals or your close friends and family.

You need to talk to people and feel the sting of pride to kick you of of your current slouch. Not everyone is proud of you no matter what and you need to hear it. Social pressure is the best motivator and that's a good thing, use that to your advantage.

It's what I am trying to do right now and its not fun, but I feel it working. Every day now the past weeks I am getting more and more conscious of myself in a good way, I am taking better care of myself and beginning to think towards my future again, all because I am (trying to) connect with people both virtually and in reality.

So talk. Listen. Feel the sting of pride. Know that you're not alone.

I was taking 30 for a few years and I was getting to a point where I was taking them at 8 and crashing around like 2pm and I didn't even get off work until 5. My PCP is pretty chill so when I explained this to her she prescribed me a 10mg to go with my 30mg.

I don't know much about vyvanse but I know sometimes you can get a smaller dose prescribed as a pick me up for later in the day. 

I would inquire her doctor about possibly upping her dosage to the next mg option or if there's a smaller dose she can take after school.

Unfortunately meds don't ever seem to last the entire day as much as I would love of they did, (I'd get so much more done around the house) but they definitely should be lasting long enough for her to be able to come home and do homework before it wears off.

After some stressful/demanding weeks at work, my intrusive thoughts spun out of control. I felt practically debilitated for a month and it took quite a bit of additional daily prozac to get me back to “normal.” 

So after all that, I still have my ADHD symptoms and I’m really frustrated that stimulants might not be for me. Because although brief (and definitely not worth a repeated experience), the Ritalin DID work! I noticed an improvement in ADHD issues quickly. I’m now taking strattera (non-stimulant) to address ADHD and I’ve not noticed a change yet (after about 5 months. It’s a very slow building drug). My doctor is very hesitant to prescribe me any stimulants in the future, and I can very much understand why.

I started CBASP--a type of therapy designed for chronic depression. It might be worth it for you to look into situation analysis techniques--my therapist calls it ""fly on the wall.""

Fly on the wall stuff has helped me get much, much, much better at pausing, breathing, and thinking over things before acting on my emotional reactions.

It was really really hard at first. But practicing it in therapy has turned it into more of a habit. I'm still not perfect

"1434","Honest first drink on meds in real time.... 

I've just had my first proper drink on meds (lisdexamfetamine - Elvanse) in a safe environment = my home and having a work team Christmas drink over Skype.. Very different from all previous fun and/ or regrettable pre med outings with alcohol. (37 f and like all drinks pref wine or gin for norms.)

 This time only 4 pints 5.4% beer. After 3 pints I felt enough is enough and happy, but being in the environment I am I wasintrigued to push it to 4 pints.... Scientific and medicinal thought process driven.. Obvs.. 

 I know when I have previously drunk on an empty stomach, pre meds and with a social interaction I've been hyped going on nervous or social aniexties to over compensate...some great times but also some gut wrenching wtf moments incurred. 

This time I feel hyped but in a controlled and a calm way. What I've read about drinking on this med is, you can drink before you really accept being typsy or drunk. 

I would not feel this comfortable if I was out and in a bar, pub or club and in a normal social environment. This comment is based upon my known pre med social aniexties and ability to cope and get silly being  my normal driver and thought process. 

If in a normal drinking environment, I may  even feel I'm being drunk / having fun and in control of thoughts but not in control of my body and actions, having that sense or feeling it could be too late, meaning I could be a liability for others or a danger to myself. I now understand drinking on this level of 'clarity' is not a good mix. 

I am in a good and safe place ( being at home) to end this social interaction and being comfortably in the knowledge to end it sensibly and safely. 

I now know I have to do work on my social aniexty and look beyond the actions at the cause and when and who would be appropriate to drink around

I'm done with proof reading this message.. and ready to chill. I may regret posting this all tomorrow but hey, it's all a lesson. Stay safe, know your limitations and understand your mind and mood pre meds. You have askedthis question for a reason knowing your own history and where you want to go.

Work with your inner circle of friends and family if you do want to see what drinking is like if you feel you really need too and feel you need to drink regardless of the  majority saying don't do it.

 I am going to be very careful as to when or if I drink and I will certainly let those close to me know this may be a risk. I have to realise I have relied on drinking to cope in circumstances like I have relied on food in other... Curbed appetite also means I have to face home truths.","ggaix1d",1,1608324321,"2020-12-18 20:45:21"

They may be picking up on subjects in five minutes that the teacher spends the whole day on, which causes them to get bored and act out. Once a child has a reputation for acting out (as I did when I was in that situation), they often feel he need to continue acting out even when they know deep down it is not the right thing to do. If I could go back and say something to my younger self it would be to be nice to other people and they will be nice to you, the only reason other children may feel uncomfortable around you is because you always answer and understand things in class and they don’t like that. Odds are your child will grow into their intelligence and learn how to use their ADHD to their advantage by using the hyper focus that can sometimes come with ADHD to study when needed. Maybe look into getting your child tested for the school’s gifted program or getting an outside IQ test as it may shed further light on the situation.

"1443","Something I have started doing, that I’ve found success in is what I call the 5 minute rule. I’m not the inventor, but I have tweaked it to fit my situation better. My issue was having what seemed like a never ending list of small, low reward things to do. The idea is, that any task that takes about 5 minutes, is to be done immediately. If it takes more than 5 minutes, and I don’t want to be doing it, I give myself full permission to quit at the 5 minute mark. Typically I end up getting done in less than 5 minutes, and it helps me build momentum to complete other tasks. If I don’t finish in less than 5 minutes, it’s typically near done, and 9/10 times I’ll finish anyways. If it’s a truly shitty task and I do chose yo walk away, typically there’s so little to do, I can convince myself to get it done later. It also gives a little dopamine hit, which can’t hurt. In the end, it helps me keep my list shorter, which helps keep my task anxiety at bay. I know the “just do it” answer isn’t usually helpful, but giving yourself permission to quit after 5 min if you want can be liberating. As for big tasks, best of luck, I haven’t mastered that at all. 
TLDR- 5 min or less task-just do it. If it takes more than 5 minutes while you are trying to get it done, you are allowed to hit. Less tasks on list=less task stress. Just think that if you spent an hour doing 5 minute tasks, you could knock up to 12 things off your list. Best part is, they’re all boring and sucky, but you only gotta spend 5 min doing it.","gi2tw78",1,1609776478,"2021-01-04 16:07:58"
"1444","And in case it's useful, this is the advice I gave over in r/skincare addiction (copypasta directly from it):

Massage therapy school was my horrific speed version of quitting (you really, really, really can't pick at your clients' skin, soooo), but here's what helped during and myself:

So first, the practical: What triggers the picking? Boredom? Looking in the mirror? If boredom, get yourself fidgets that are usable by the hand that picks. I pulled out my eyebrows entirely and picked to bleeding in college, and one thing that has helped hugely (other than overall coping skills, etc) is having things I can do with my left hand--earrings, play with my necklace, sub in hair twirling, etc.

Body-focused compulsions usually have other mental stuff hand-in-hand, so work on that, too.

If it's looking in the mirror, set a timer for your skincare sessions. When I started picking, it'd get hypnotic, and it'd be god knows how long later and I'd be shredded. Timers interrupt that process.

REWARD YOURSELF. Small goals. You won't be able to go cold turkey. Get a jar and a goal--new laptop, something awesome, and smaller goals too. Give yourself a marble or something for every time you look at a zit and don't pick it. Doesn't matter if you pick it the next day, no punishment: if you look or want to pick and resist it, even if only for a while, you get a marble. Cash those in: Starbucks gift card, Amazon, your favorite ice cream, etc. SLATHER yourself in rewards. HUGE, AWESOME rewards for the smallest steps.

Is it the sensation/action that gets you? Like, is it the actual digging/picking/popping process that is hella satisfying? For me, that's a huge fucking yes--I discovered that painting my nails with cheap polish and picking the polish off with my nails si the most. amazing. thing. ever. And you can do it over and over. It's not AMAZING for your nails, but nowhere near skinpicking.

Now, as to the WHY skinpicking is bad, though it never helped me--we know it's not great for us,but:
You create a new gap for bad stuff to get into. Unless you are magic and can close that pore or wound, you've made the situation worse by opening a space that's just gonna get more sebum and dead stuff in it since you can't instantaneously close that pore, or you have a wound to manage, and scars are even harder to deal with.
Your body clears this stuff every day. First off, much of it isn't HARMFUL, just annoying. Think of the THOUSANDS of pores on your body, and think of how many TRULY are clogged: it's genuinely the minority of them. Truly. 

Statistically and quantifiably, most of them are not clogged. Therefore, your body REALLY CAN clear them. It may need help and some things speed up the process, like chem exfoliants and BP can help keep it clean, but your body REALLY CAN take care of it itself, and will do a better job than you. Lots of things never come to a head because they never get that far, or clear away--we just don't notice because they aren't issues, same way we don't notice all the days we sleep just fine because we feel just fine after.

Finally, talk to a counselor. Skin picking almost always coexists with stuff and starts as a coping mechanism somehow, because skin is constant and palpable and visual and lends a lovely means of ""control"" in our lives, or can become a really inconvenient fidget, or stimming, or anxiety, etc.

(There is some evidence that n-acetyl cysteine can help reduce the urge to skinpick or pull hair, but you should do your own research and consult a doctor to make sure it would be OK for you to take, etc., I am not a doctor nor do I play one on TV nor did I stay at a Holiday Inn last night.)","dbwz4rc",2,1483389416,"2017-01-02 20:36:56"

"1476","""Hyperfocus"" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD.

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

"1494","Yeah, it was a combination of both. First loan I did an oopsie and spent too much, so I ended up with two refi loans. I did some hard thinking about that second one. Technically I guess I should call it a debt consolidation loan, since you can use it for multiple things. In the near term it will hit your credit but in the mid term it can improve your credit because of fewer accounts.

If the account that is in collections is bothering you, you may be able to negotiate a payoff amount for that. Debt collectors are typically quite happy to settle with a percentage of the debt as a lump sum (up to negotiating) because they buy your debt for cheap. If you can save money there, it may be worth paying that first to get the mark taken away. Keep multiple copies of the payoff confirmation if you do that.

Also up to you to decide fixed vs variable interest. Fixed might be a bump up but the Fed has set rates super low right now. It gets a bit mathy trying to guess how early you'd have to pay the variable one off vs when the Fed raises rates again.","gvchkz5",1,1619026224,"2021-04-21 17:30:24"

The NHS was long, complex and ultimately impossible. Specialists are paediatric, and very little for adults as it's still a relatively novel diagnosis in the UK and often has all the BS stigma attached to it.

She (GP) wrote a ""referral"" letter, so psychiatrist knew I wasn't a chancer. Psychiatrist was a specialist in adult ADHD, employed by the NHS largely as a prison doctor (which is great! Pleased to see that population, which is so afflicted with ADHD amongst other things, getting help). 

I saved up £500 for the consult. It was about 1.5 hours plus some phone calls. This in about 2015 or 16.

He did private scripts for a few weeks to fix dosage, then GP took over, and has been prescribing ever since. Her buy in has been invaluable. 

Private scripts were free to write for dosage, but pharmacies charged more than the NHS fee. But now, I buy a yearly prescription pass (£120) and the scripts are effectively free (I have asthma meds too).

"1518","Strictly speaking on medication experiences, I've been on adderall, ritalin, concerta, and strattera. The stimulants were great for motivation, reducing incessant fidgeting and helping me focus. However, they were not so great for anxiety and depression. I'm now on strattera and I really like it. It takes a while to make a noticeable difference but once it started working I liked it much better than the stimulants. I have less side effects, no crash, and it actually helped the anxiety and depression without the need for separate medications unlike when I was on stimulants. It's not as good for the focus and motivation aspects immediately like the stimulants are, but it helped to stop the racing thoughts, daily ups and downs from feeling incapable of completing anything and calmed the anxiety. I still fidget like mad, but I'm better able to focus, plan and finish things, and not lose my shit over little things I usually forgot or left unfinished.

A higher score is indicative of worsening symptoms. The ADHD-RS uses questions about the patient’s behavior, such as whether they have difficulty paying attention or regularly interrupt others. The trial showed that subjects using the eTNS device had statistically significant improvement in their ADHD symptoms compared with the placebo group. At the end of week four, the average ADHD-RS score in the active group decreased from 34.1 points at baseline to 23.4 points, versus a decrease from 33.7 to 27.5 points in the placebo group.

Having said that, stimulants increase stress on your body and it might require more sleep to recover fully. So I would suggest that you make sure your diet is on point, lots of high quality protein, fish oils, antioxidants, vegetables, etc, etc. Stimulants may also lower the quality of your sleep. Try melatonin in very small dosages (less than 1 mg, higher dosages do not increase effectiveness). Melatonin allows some people to fall sleep faster and achieve a deeper state of sleep in less time, ultimately requiring less sleep.

My point is, if you want kids, do not let ADHD hold you back, but make sure you and your husband are prepared to support your child if they do have ADHD like you would support them if they had any other issue.

Also, as far as feeling like a monster, my husband and I discussed the possibility having a child with mental health issues because his side of the family has some major mental health problems like schizophrenia and severe bipolar (like spent years in mental institutions severe).

"1577","I'm a high school teacher with 7 years in the classroom under my belt. I absolutely love my job and couldn't imagine doing anything else really. Being in front of a class, basically being an entertainer for the more boring information delivery and then floating around the room while they do their work, always being in motion, is perfect for me. Also because I'm the only history teacher and New Zealand has a very broad, flexible curriculum without any standardised testing I can teach all my favourite subjects at whatever pace or depth I wish and can change them year to year so I don't get bored. Since I can hyperfocus on those areas of interest I am known for having a stunning level of depth on what I teach and get called a walking google.  

But the ADHD is a big problem for me when it comes to the out of the classroom stuff. Marking essays, writing reports, all paperwork really, drives me nuts. My desk is always a sea of disorganised papers and I'm always losing the remote to my projector or my whiteboard markers or something really important. I also have an issue with getting off on tangents in class and, worse, am myself the worst distraction to my students when they're doing group work and I end up talking to something off topic. They know I'm easy to distract and are eager to exploit that weakness! 

I was just officially diagnosed a couple days ago so I haven't had a chance to see how treatment might help me improve my organisation and my huge problems getting work marked on time and writing reports before the deadlines. 

My colleagues would likely be shocked to know I've been diagnosed because mostly they wouldn't have connected my messy desk, excellent long-term memory but awful working memory and fast talking with their image of ADHD as the unruly kids they're always putting in detention.

"1578","Mine manifests in lots of impulsive blurting out random things, comments, thoughts, etc, out of nowhere, out of context, or just inappropriately. Not out of a compulsion, but because sometimes I get so excited I just can't contain it. The WORDS MUST COME OUT!

I overspend sometimes, because at the time, it just doesn't occur to me that this is a bad idea. I'm a 36 yo female, so with age comes a better grasp on budgeting. I still struggle and have relapses with impulse control, but it's getting better. 

I require lots of stimulation: audiobooks if I'm working on the computer; games on iPhone if I'm anywhere remotely quiet. I watch movies while knitting and listening to an audiobook or music. This stimulation calms me in some way, I'm not sure how that works. 

Professionally, I'm a hot mess. I do pretty good at hiding it, but I make TONS of teensy mistakes (counting errors, handed out wrong pamphlet, forgot to check a certain box).  I work for psychologists, so maybe they are a little forgiving, and none of my mistakes are world-ending by any means, but I'm remarkably inconsistent. Sometimes I can pay attention to detail, but it's not often and it's extremely tiring. 

My mind wanders and races a lot; I think that is why I like audio books, because my thoughts settle on to the book. Granted, I'm typing this right now while completely engrossed in an audio book, watching the cars go by, the air conditioner is kind of loud, and there is a weird pain in my back; I notice all of this, but I still manage to be completely oblivious to the details. 


Executive functions is a large problem for me: i have a difficult time goal setting; if I want to get anything done I have to make a checklist; I have synced all of my appointments, reminders, ANYTHING to my calendar that will spam with me with reminders. Too many things to do cause me to have some kind of melt down, as if I'm overwhelmed, causing a lot of anxiety. 

 Timliness is a joke. My kids were pretty much late every day to school. I never realized it was time to leave until it was already too late; and I set 3 timers on my Fitbit to tell me when it was time to get shoes on, get bags, leave the house. I could be watching the clock and still be befuddled as to how I was late.  My poor kids, though. I try, I TRY so hard to be places on time for them, to not be late. 
My daughter was late 37 times one 9 week period, my husband was not amused. (Spouse, btw, does not believe that I have ADHD). She also complains that I don't give her enough attention or focus on her enough, I try though. I try. I try hard. I listen to people better if I knit or have something to do with my hands, some sort of stimulation, but it upsets her when I do that. She wants me to drop it all and pay attention to her when she speaks (I do), but gets frustrated because I can't focus on her (I do--my brain goes haywire when I try to focus on one thing.)

I'm on meds, the only thing I've noticed is that I'm able to sit in one place longer. Meh.

Truthfully I think for me it’s because for all of middle and high school I based my intelligence level on my grades. I had horrible grades, and because of that I felt dumb. But I didn’t realize that my grades were only bad because I wasn’t turning homework on time. Like, that was all. I tended to do well on tests and when I did turn things in on time (especially writing assignments) I would get good grades on those. It was just late work that was saying me down, not my intelligence.

Then when it came to applying to college (although grades *are* a part of it) I mainly got in based on my strengths and my intelligence. My application essay, my experiences outside of school, and my thought-out answers to the questions on the app are what got me in, not just the numbers and letters on my report card. 

Once I changed my definition of my intelligence and capability to not mean *grades*, I was more able to accept that I deserved my success.

Well, Strattera has a different mechanism to amphetamine and also has less abuse potential so I doubt they will suspect you of drug seeking behaviour if you ask to try that instead.

Methylphenidate also works differently, however it is a stimulant that can be abused so that may be a little harder to swap to if they suspect you of drug seeking.

It's gotten so much easier for me. I will say though that it might be easier for women to do this than men. My guy friend has been struggling with the same thing and he said it looks like it's easier for girls to start conversations. It might be true, because it's super easy to go up to some girl and compliment her on her hair or clothing or whatever. That's pretty much my go-to for starting to talk to someone.

One thing I've learned though, is that the worst that can happen is someone ignores you or just drops the conversation and walks away. Most people aren't going to be any more rude than that if they don't want to talk to you. Know when to leave them be. There's plenty more people you can try to talk to. 

The other thing I've learned, being genuinely friendly and giving off a good mood rubs off on others. They will most likely respond the same if you compliment them or say good morning, or asking how they are doing.

buuuutttttttt


I finally did it this morning.. 
Went through all the paper, dusted, organized stationary and pens, etc.


It's a DESK!!!! A clean one!

I feel better now.

"1619","I am so sorry you had that experience. It makes me furious to hear about the bias comment from this clinician. It is very irresponsible in the mental health field to use personal inferences. The thing about ADHD I didn't realize until after I was diagnosed is the amount of compensating I did on a daily basis . You build up these skills over a lifetime! You get really good at compensating, until you hit a wall that blocks your ability to compensate and you just start flailing and failing. You either hit the wall and give up or find an alternative way to compensate.That is until you find the next wall and the cycle repeats. This is the camouflage ADHD can hide under and why sometimes it can be so difficult to discover until adulthood. It makes me sad that people disregard the effort it takes to even get to the point of considering having a ADHD diagnosis. Which makes this consultant's comment even worse. 

As a fellow individual with a masters degree AND ADHD, fuck this consultant and go get a second opinion and diagnosis. I dont know the situation of what was going on when you went, but if you are currently taking medications and getting treatment for the ADHD, it is possible to NOT fit in the nonexistent box of ADHD. It means your medications are working. ADHD can also look different in adults compared to children and can present differently across biological sexes. It does have a diagnosis tool, but I would be very curious to see what this consultant's box looks like. I dont want you taking this consultant's word without looking into a second opinion. Diagnosing tools are there for a reason, but with anything using self reporting it is subject to bias whether that be from the reporter or the interviewer.

"1657","That is certainly a tough one. How you are feeling is completely understandable too.  

There is a stigma with ADHD no matter where you go. My dad always believed my problem was that I was a space shot and simply needed to put more effort into paying attention. It took him a few years after the initial diagnosis to start being more understanding. I think his fear was also because he was afraid of the stigma. His family is closed minded to stuff like this. I am from America and many people here have really ignorant comments about it.

You do not have to tell anyone if you don't want to. You need to be able to keep it to yourself. Maybe write in a journal about your feelings. That may help lift the burden of not telling anyone. 

With dating, some people may judge you for it. But you said you wouldn't judge anyone. Look for someone like that. You wouldn't just want any person, you want someone supportive, open minded, and accepting. 

Try to view it more positively. If you talk to your doctor and get help, great! Also, don't look for support where you can't get it. While it is unfortunate, your family doesn't sound like they are capable of helping or supporting you. A doctor may be able to help you find others who will be there for your needs. 

Basically, just do it. You are not happy so change it. I know your worried about how bad things could get but you don't sound like you are OK with the way things are. Nothing positive will come from doing nothing.

"1658","We feel the neurodiversity movement is harmful to people with ADHD. While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

I feel like my mental problems allow me to ask better questions and increase my creativity. However, they also come at huge cost to my health, make me extremely indecisive, and cause me a great deal of suffering. When I say blessing and curse, most people will look at it as one or the other. 

“Well you should focus on the blessing part!” (Basically the superpower spiel)

or 

“How could you possibly think that something which has ignited so much self destruction within you is a blessing” (something to be suppressed rather than understood)


It’s kind of fucked up because on some level I don’t want to get of rid of it (or my other issues). Like I’m afraid that meds will eventually ruin all the positives and only leave me with the negatives. As I said, it’s kind of fucked up, but there are times when I actually think it’s a positive thing. I like the way my brain is. I wouldn’t like it if I was so “straight thinking” and “in order” or “standard.” It’s very difficult to describe. However, it also makes me miserable. Almost daily. Sometimes I cry wishing I was normal, didn’t overthink things so much, wasn’t lazy, didn’t forget to do so much, wasn’t a failure, etc. I just wonder how far down this hole am I willing to go for the sake of finding some way to implement the “benefits” I feel inside. 

I was just expressing that most people I’ve met with ADHD (admittedly, not many bc I’ve been really depressed lately) don’t usually talk about test taking in this matter. It’s still a struggle, even if it’s easy to focus during the actual test. As you said, it still takes a lot of effort. Maybe it’s just me or my variation of ADHD, but I don’t think we can really “breeze” through anything. Once again, maybe I’m wrong (and I’d like to hear other people’s perspectives). Even people without it don’t really just go through tests like that. If you’re well prepared that’s a different story. If you really know the information, then you probably could go through a test pretty easily (I have done that before). It’s just odd to describe ADHD as something you “control.” Like “I put on my ADHD lens on and killed this test; Finished it within minutes!” At best I feel like it’d be a situation where you were able to manage it really well (once again, that’s my own experience so I may be wrong and would appreciate other people’s experiences).","g94ta3o",1,1602963997,"2020-10-17 19:46:37"

Firstly, the way they ""presented"" it to me. Essentially called me down and told me about it, started making plans before I even got a say in anything. Almost as if they were more concerned over their statistics.. color me surprised /s. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. 
Also seemed to ignore the fact that I'd been doing fine at school. Higher end of my class, actually.  
Reminds me of the time that I was put into some program for ~~less than intelligent~~ hispanic students. Whoever put me there also completely disregarded my ability in school, only focusing on the fact that I'm of hispanic heritage. Notice a pattern?  
Another reason, I just didn't want to trouble the teachers. I know, it's their job, but they don't get paid any extra for the personal accommodations, and they have enough work as it is...  

The whole co-morbid thing.. I had thought about it but didn't know it was true  
And yes, there was also an anxiety and depression diagnoses... but I'm not quite sure how to deal with any of them.  
Generally keep to myself (in regards to anxiety) and any negative feelings from depression are just hidden. Scarily simple, though I know it varies from person to person. 

&gt;Also, exercise and enough sleep and a healthy diet all help with ADHD symptoms too.  

Wew. Explains a little bit seeing as though I do a shit job at all of those.  
Exercise is just kinda ""Meh I don't really need it, I'm skinny enough as it is""  
Which is probably tied to a little bit under-eating. Usually just enough to get me through the day.  
And sleep... hows an average of 5 hours of sleep sound?

"1799","My bad behavior and childhood intelligence brought me lots of attention. I don’t know what was said, but the school got my parents to take me in. Like you, I was diagnosed young with depression and severe ADHD. Parents swept it under the rug because they feared Ritalin and couldn’t accept their kid had something wrong. It was only bad behavior anyway, right? 

Fast forward to senior year. Pops finally told me the truth. I graduated amongst the top of my class. I go to college and struggle more with ADHD and depression here than I ever did my entire life. I went and received an updated adhd diagnosis, where I was diagnosed with ADHD and Depression again. 

I eventually found Adderall and take that as prescribed. I will admit that it helps, somewhat. I struggle immensely with my ADHD symptoms, with or without adderall. The difference between the two is between getting work done 5min before it’s due or not finishing on time. 

I am in my 20’s. I’m struggling (have been) in college. Why is it so hard for me to just sit down and study even with adderall? I’m tired of the struggle and emptiness I have a majority of the time. I’m so forgetful it’s ridiculous. My relationships are always strained by me not managing myself correctly. 

Does anyone have tips?

"1813","First, I’m saddened to hear that you’ve experienced sexual assault and am sincerely sorry that you experienced that. 

So, I’d say that common wisdom in interview strategy or whatever would say that you should mention literally almost none of this. Since that’s the case, I’m wondering if you know that this isn’t stuff one would generally mention in a job interview. But, I guess it matters what the job is for. Google about interview stuff, it’d be a good place to start in learning what employers generally want to talk about.

Sounds like this is a list of things you notice about yourself to the extent that you believe it makes up who you are, and you want people to know these things about you to understand who you are. For what it’s worth, you’re in good company in this sub. Not that I’m a major contributor but yeah it’s good here. Everything you mentioned sounds like something that someone here may relate to.

In my opinion, It’s vastly more important that you take yourself as seriously as you hope to be taken, than whether some interviewer takes you seriously. When you take yourself more seriously, so will others. I think that’s where confidence comes from. I’ve been working on that for a while, and it’s harder to attain when you have a list of ADHD challenges and times when it made you feel shame.

Hope I’m not coming off like a dick. Good luck with the interview.

Do you know if you take instant release medication (lasts about 2-4 hours) or extended release medication (lasts about 8-10 hours)?

And if you take instant release how many times a day you take it?

If you still have trouble focusing while at school make sure to bring this up with your psychiatrist/doctor as well. While medication will treat ADHD symptoms you still need to learn to study, make homework, listen to a lecture and process that information and to retain it. 

Medication wont suddenly make you an amazing student. It will just diminish ADHD symptoms.","dmhbtr6",6,1504383869,"2017-09-02 20:24:29"

"1867","Not trying to be rude or insulting in anyway here, just giving my thoughts. I am woman with ADHD, and I'm in the dating world. I find your post and comments puzzling, and tbh it feels like you're playing games. 

Take your food example. Nothing in those examples would make me think it's an allergy (you said that's the point as you don't want to say you have ADHD) but those examples say two completely different things depending on whether you know the person has food allergies. Your ADHD examples are the same. I read them picturing what I'd think if they were on a dating profile, and without knowing about the ADHD I'd take them in a completely different way. I hope this make sense. If I dated a guy who said he listed those as a heads up because he has ADHD but didn't want to say it... I would feel bamboozled, like he did false advertising. Just a perspective to consider. I do think it's awesome you want to give a heads up but my advice is just be you, don't word things  to try play off your ADHD as traits that you would have if you didn't have ADHD, and just communicate it relatively soon after you start dating. 

Note to maybe help clarify: you would have some of these traits anyways but I don't think that's the point here...like your food example: you can be a picky eater without allergies, but suddenly that statement changes when you know the reason...from someone who is picky to someone who is seriously at risk. So my reaction goes from ""picky can be annoying at times"" to ""I totally understand and hope the allergies aren't life threatening"". Allergies aren't a deal breaker, whereas pickiness makes me wonder what else the person is picky about and do I want to deal with that trait (dated a picky person and it caused fights).

The thing we suddenly had boundless energy and passion for 3 weeks (so much passion that it interfered with responsibilities and edged out all other activities) is now completely unappealing (noxious even), and we've moved on to something new and shiny. Relationship investment can definitely be part of that cycle and our partners suffer from our (to them) rather unpredictable motivating forces. However, we are not to be let off the hook for this. External structure from family and friends is a key ingredient in our development of adaptations that keep us connected to our social networks and keep us healthy. When I'm 3 days into a deep focus, I'm glad my spouse is there to say ""broccoli, you need to brush your teeth and then you need to eat or there will be blood."" ADHD folks tend to have a related issue with situational peripheral blindness: that which we don't actually physically witness hasn't or isn't happening. We exist in a constant state of reactionary response to our immediate environment and do not engage in proactive problem solving without external help. Calling my spouse when she is out of town requires post-its on screens, nightstands and refrigerators. I put the post-its up not because I want to call her (whatever I'm doing in that moment is of course ""highly important""), but because I love her and she deserves it. This didn't happen overnight: my spouse made it known that it wasn't ok for me to go radio silent, and together we developed a system that is both redundant and resilient to my flights of fancy.","d4fyqdi",7,1466381799,"2016-06-20 00:16:39"

1. Quit while you’re ahead. If you’re feeling good about what you’ve done and you’ve done a good amount, stop. It’s better to leave the ‘adulting’ time feeling good than quitting once you run into a roadblock, because then you associate that time with feeling stressed put &amp; overwhelmed. 

2. Go 80%. Kind of the same as rule number one, just different wording. If I go 100% every time, I will generally see my tasks as “done”, when really stuff like housekeeping, keeping my inbox organized, going through paperwork, etc is never really done but an ongoing set of things to be managed. 

These help me not get burnt out. Also, I try to remember a little bit every day is better than a bulk amount once a week, which leaves me resentful, exhausted &amp; never wanting to do that shit again. ","e2h3c32",6,1531737639,"2018-07-16 10:40:39"

 * every Friday on the way home from work I shop for food/supplies. (i know ones I get home i'm unlikely to leave)

 * When I buy supplies, I always buy in 2. and my goal is always have 2 on hand. so hopefully I'm never without soap or shampoo or trash bags, extra. I try to buy at 1 down. usually that works out to running out and buying 2. But that seems to work better for me then just buying one. 
 * when I buy food I always buy some canned food, frozen. That's my fallback food. That way, if I fail to go shopping I still have food to eat. 
 * Our laundry mat uses coins. that actually forces me to wash my car. (because they have a  dollar to coin converter) 
 * after I eat I wash my dishes right away. (because I found I have now or never. so I choose now) 
 * I buy toilet paper in the largest size. And treat the 1/2 mark as running out. and having to buy more. it helps that I have my Friday shop days. 
 * every time I shower, I shave, brush my teeth, extra. That way even if I stay home for a while. I don't end up feeling grubby.

It was simultaneously gratifying and terrifying and exciting and infuriating all at once to find out how  I have exhibited these symptoms to a tee for my entire thirty years of life, and can now go about getting help.

Today I printed off the forms to sign up to my local doctor's clinic, and have them by the door ready to take over first thing tomorrow. That in itself was a mammoth task, and I know it's just the first step on what will be a long journey, but I'm determined not to let this hold me back anymore.","ghyzx90",1,1609694734,"2021-01-03 17:25:34"
"1939","For the first year of my treatment for ADHD my psychiatrist told me he was still unclear if it was truly ADHD I had, or if I was maybe Bipolar, when he was finally 100% sure that I was not bipolar and was in fact ADHD my psychiatrist explained it to me like this; 

* ""Picture the stereotypical hyperactive ADHD child whose running all around the house with his cape on thinking he's a superhero flying around the home. He won't be stopped by anyone or anything as he runs up and down the stairs, all around the house, jumping on and off of the furniture, etc. he goes on like this full speed ahead and will even climb out the second story window still in superhero flight mode onto the roof and will even get right up to the edge of the roof. The ADHD kid will eventually stop as he gets to the edge of the roof, the bipolar person in a manic state will be almost indistinguishable from the hyperactive ADHD person's behavior in this scenario, except once at the edge of the roof, the person with bipolar jumps off the roof without slight hesitation."" *

I know it's a simplistic analogy but it was the way the doctor put it to me when I was spending a week inpatient at a MH facility and started to doubt myself as I always held firm I was ADHD not bipolar, but when I had a mental breakdown due to anxiety and depression and was admitted, I started to doubt myself, ironically that inpatient stint was when my doctor was able to confidently know without any more doubt that I was definitely not bipolar, and that explanation was why.","d9kjsyy",2,1478207246,"2016-11-03 21:07:26"

Meds make me calmer and more focused, so I enjoy socialising more and am better to be around. Too strong a dose would make me appear pretty zombie like, as I wouldn't really react or get bored, I'd just be 'this is fine I shall now focus on this one thing forever'.

"1955","Hmm how often have you gotten lost before?\* That's absolutely happened to me before (30 minutes going in the wrong direction on a highway...more than once). I get lost when walking anywhere I'm slightly less familiar with too. My tips there are 1) Just keep driving until you find a place to pull over. Don't worry about getting un-lost until you've stopped the car, can take a breath, and can give all your focus to your phone/gps/handdrawn map (even with a smartphone, I still prefer to hand-draw maps before leaving if it's somewhere new....)  2) Always have your phone/GPS charged and available so that you can reference it (and always have in the back of your mind that you can reference it). I usually look at a map every 2 minutes or so whether walking or driving...even if it's a straight line to a place I've been before! Basically, when I'm in motion, my brain is my phone.

Editing to add\*: 3) basically just try getting lost more often until you get used to getting un-lost/practice how to calmly and pleasantly get un-lost until it's no big deal. Maybe even find reasons to drive nowhere in particular without a map, bring a journal, and just sit in a random parking lot playing music and journaling until it's time to figure out how to get home (frame it as ""exploring"" instead of ""failing to get groceries"")

As for the others...what are the conditions in which these things are least daunting? I'll print out my research or classwork and read it outside, or sit at a cafe early in the morning. My motivation and ability to function is 95% dependent on the environment--I don't want to work, but I do want to sit in a cafe. Once I'm in a cafe with music and people and a big window to look out of, the work actually becomes pleasant! And stepping out of the cafe for a horrible phone call becomes a reason to stand up and move, and breaks up the monotony of classwork. When COVID was worse here I did my best to simulate that environment with coffee and an ""office"" corner of my dorm room, or just bribed myself with ice cream. (However, since a nearby cafe opened up I've been 1000x more productive).

So my first suggestion is 1) Find or create a happy-study-place. (Definitely consider the \* aesthetic \* of studying- minimalism? maximalism? scarves, houseplants, and a leather-bound notebook? What's your vibe?)

2) You can also try to merge into doing work/calls by texting friends (although I procrastinate on messaging people back too. Horribly.) Just texting someone can ""activate my brain"" sometimes, and is a lower-stress task than actually working, but gets you started doing \* something \* (especially if you're spam-texting them to complain about the work you have to do, which triggers your subconscious to start planning/doing the work). It's most helpful if you have someone who knows you struggle with stress/procrastination/etc though-- I'd often call my parents when i was too brain-fogged or stressed to work on the paper in front of me, and just be like ""I can't focus on work and need to activate my brain."" If I was under more pressure,  I'd be very direct and bounce ideas or worries off of them (usually answering my own questions before they had a chance to, of course) and then promptly hang up and start working. Or, more commonly, my parent would be...very long-winded...and as they were rambling on I'd half-listen and hold up my side of the convo while actually being very productive on my own work. Even when I don't have work, if I'm on the phone with my parents I usually end up cleaning my room or cooking or something, so if there's a task like that I've been putting off I can schedule the task + calling home at the same time. (Bonus if you text a day or two earlier to set a time to call, so someone else becomes responsible for starting the call/starting your task).","fy6vtq0",2,1594850707,"2020-07-15 22:05:07"

But I just recently started doing more research, and the sheer number of symptoms I’ve been living (functioning, really) with my whole life is staggering.

And it’s unrelated to their actual job? No? Pfftttt. 

And doesn’t everyone excel at work until an arbitrary point at which it’s boring and you’d rather shove white-hot needles in your eyeballs than complete your daily tasks? No? Huh.

And doesn’t everyone beat themselves up on an hourly basis because they can’t do the regular adult things that adults do, like fold laundry and pay bills? No? That’s weird.

Plus, you can lock and unlock it remotely, so if she locks herself out without her phone and manages to go to a neighbor to call you, you can let her back in from work. 

You can also send guest keys to neighbors or friends for the same purpose. I have a guest key to my friend’s house so I can go walk her dog when she’s out of town on business. ","duvj7e4",1,1519684375,"2018-02-26 22:32:55"

Lego sets have always been very therapeutic for me. My mom bought me a lego set for christmas after a few years of not buying any about 3 years ago, and ever since then Ive recieved a lego set for every bday and xmas. Ive also got 2 or 3 of the lego sets that have 3 different instructions for the same set of legos back at my apartment, and i love the process of disassembly and reassembly.

As a side note, my father and I, after years of being at eachothers throats, bond over star wars and he picked out an X wing lego set for last christmas while I, by complete coincidence, had bought him a small x wing model kit for his desk at work.

You might have to try different types of medication before you find the right one for you.

However, medication by itself might not be the only problem. Previewing material, and trying to fully understand what's going on will really improve your ability to follow the lecturer. I don't take any notes at all during the lecture, instead I sit and try to absorb as much as I can. After class I immediately go to the library, look over the slides and write notes/flashcards **in my own words**.

But the reality is even if your adhd isn't severe you are, in a technical pedantic sense, mentally retarded. Part of your brain didn't develop properly. The growth was retarded.

I know, touchy word, but if people without it actually saw it in those terms they might understand there are some serious problems going on inside that they can't see.

So I don't hide it or talk around it. Neither do I use it to scapegoat my behaviours (for the most part). If someone does the eye roll when I mention it I politely start into a ADHD 101 lecture so they have a better understanding of the disorder and make it clear to them I'm one of the lucky ones.

My advice for YOU is to find a new job if they are going to make you use this system. And to make it known to them that forcing you to use this system will force you to leave under good graces before you inevitably fail and get fired instead.

You need to lay out that the system is not something you can work with, that you have x, y, z problems with it, that you have x, y, z disorder, that your system has the same quality standards as the new system (this is critical), and that it falls under reasonable accommodations to allow you to use the old system. This is essential, you should record this meeting, and only have the meeting after getting a consultation from a lawyer and from your therapist.

Just know that when you enter this territory its do or die. You need to be ready to loose your job over this issue. Whether you will lose in court is an entirely seperate issue. It's all about diplomacy. ","ecpk3mw",1,1545973790,"2018-12-28 05:09:50"

"2029","I have been so lucky as to have supportive people in my life who do not view it as a limitation but understand i work differently. My parents, my teachers etc....however when i started working full time ADHD became a taboo subject like never before.  I disclosed my diagnosis to a few people off the cuff and one told me not to tell others about it (too late) and the other went to HR to ""mandatorily disclose a disclosed disability"". (i have that in quotes because i do not actually think ADHD is a disability under ADA workplace compliance...i also have MDD and know the rules about disclosing that so....). My inbox was filled with things about extra time and aid and just it felt like the company was overcompensating for future likely discrimination.  Then a few weeks later, my first reviews came back and they were extra harsh and little things seemed to be way overblown and the person who was in charge of compiling and putting the reviews together was the person who went to hr and stuff. I felt that his knowledge of my ADHD caused him to view certain feedback given on me in a harsher light than others.  

&amp;#x200B;

I guess this is all to say those that love me try their best to understand me. However being in environments where ADHD can actively hold you back due to other peoples' perception is so new to me and it DOES exist.

My last formal big - company review happened at a time when I was doing pretty well. I knew I had stuff to improve on, but I was making progress. On my review I had encouraging notes but the numeric trading scores that screwed me over. I didn't argue.  
  
Company is very big and spread out. I was in Milwaukee, my boss was in Canada, and my project leader lived in Puerto Rico and worked in Milwaukee (they let her work from home most of the time and come to the office once a month).   
  
A few weeks later my boss called from Canada. All upset. Told me she hadn't realized those ratings would make me ineligible for raises and bonuses. Said when she checked ""room for improvement"" she meant that this year she had been so impressed with my performance she was sure I'd do even better next year. She hadn't realized that in that company ""room for improvement"" means ""you suck, but we aren't firing you yet"".  
  
She said they wouldn't let her change the rating, but she'd get it right next year and push for any raises she could. Several months later 9/11 happened, management panicked and laid off thousands, including all the web people, and I was a web guy.

If you find yourself knowing you need to eat, but not being able to cook or identify cravings, drink a protein shake and go for a walk/run. Bring a pen/ paper and try to write down a meal or two that you can cook for that day/ week. 

I think it’s generally helpful for me to bias toward fat oil and protein, vs rolling the dice on questionable carbs (I find rice, quinoa, and sourdough to be the safest grains for me). Otherwise there’s plenty of carbs in squash, potatoes, root veg that I think have a slower glycemic response (?) (slower to spike blood sugar) than most grocery store “bread”. Plus side is that all of these things keep for a long time in your pantry. A well stocked pantry is key to always having food. 

Hope someone finds something here.","gjl5k8g",1,1610891931,"2021-01-17 13:58:51"

"2067","My understanding of CFS is that it’s simply a collection of symptoms with a specific underlying cause. Not that it doesn’t exist, it’s just a vague diagnosis when there’s a more specific explanation, such as ADHD, hormone imbalance, or sleep. But I digress....

I’ve always struggled with fatigue and I really believe that my ADHD has a lot to do with it. I get bored and unengaged easily and get tired. This is pretty common with [CDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_cognitive_tempo), which is a feature of my ADD. CDD is a relatively new thing in psychology, but there’s been some good studies behind it. I really do think he could benefit from being evaluated since a lot of the symptoms you hit on are pretty unique to ADD.

My father is a perfect example. He's the polar opposite of someone with ADHD. He's a hard, dedicated worker. He does what he says he will do, on time, and without complaint. 

I tried for the longest time to get him to understand me. 

What I've learned is that I needed him to ""understand"" me, so that I could win his approval. I also learned that from his perspective, he has little chance of truly understanding mental illness in most forms. 

I don't need anyone's approval to be OK with me, and I've found the most inner peace when I seek to understand, rather than to be understood. 

My suggestion to you is to work towards getting a diagnosis. It may not be ADHD, or it may be. You wont really know until you see a professional.

I did without medication until 26. My life was royally fucked up. All I needed to do to make it worse was to into crime. Unable to keep a job, no money, about to lose my wife, and no direction. Seriously, I'd made a wreck of my life and continued to work towards making it worse. But then I finally made a choice. I sought help. 

Went to see my doctor and got a referral to my psychologist. I explained to him that all through growing up I had been put through just about every form of dietary and exercise based therapy known during the 90's. Holistic? Tried it. Meditation. Helps, but not enough to use by itself. Exercise is the same. Great for burning off all my excess energy, but cannot do enough to actually negate my ADHD.

Then I got put on medication. Dexamphetamines to be exact. Oh my shit, it all works. Stayed in the same job since, marriage is on the mend, am fit again, and have commenced further education towards my goals. I have become focused again. I have purpose AND the means to achieve.

"2136","I find it's easier to explain through metaphors that people understand.  Imagine watching television.  Your favorite show is on.  All the sudden, the audio from another channel starts playing instead of the show you're watching.  Then the images from yet another channel overlay on top of the picture from your favorite show.  So now, you're trying really super hard to watch your favorite show while listening to the audio from another and having to sort out which parts of the video are what you want to watch and which ones are from another channel.  Then the channel just changes completely to something else.  So now you're not even watching your favorite show a little any more, you're totally at the mercy of whatever this demon television wants to throw at you.  It's showing 5 shows at one time, all overlaid on top of each other.  You can't sort out which dialogue goes with which one.  You're trying, desperately, to pick one and stick with it.  But is Montresor dating Serena from Gossip Girls now?! Why is Jim Carrey laughing during Texas Chain Saw Massacre?! You start getting really frustrated, so you just give up on it and let the TV do its thing.  You just ride the waves the best you can. 

But everyone else who sits at that exact same television seems quite fine with it.  They all think it's strange that you're complaining about the TV not working properly.  They're watching their favorite show right now, and enjoying it.  ","c8pp4vw",8,1362431466,"2013-03-04 21:11:06"
"2137","Same here. I feel like I have coped with undiagnosed ADHD-PI by overcompensating with anxiety. They had me on treatments for the anxiety/depression (from being so anxious and not knowing why the hell I couldn't do things like other people could so easily), I started to notice my major anxiety was gone and I was feeling relatively ""good"" but I was still having other issues that resulted in increased anxiety and depression as a consequence, and yet I couldn't really ""feel"" the anxiety and depression.

Not sure if any of that makes sense. I'm still trying to figure it all out too, but I can say for sure, don't just treat the anxiety/depression if you believe it is connected to ADHD-PI. It won't do you any good. Try to get as much support that you can from your loved ones, be honest with them and hope they will be there for you. CBT, organization/scheduling, and the right meds can help a lot. You're never going to be 100% normal, but who really is anyway?

Or rather, I think they try to make me feel uncomfortable (in a subtle social ridicule kind of way) but the thing is I don't care what they think so to me it's not uncomfortable. However, I can see why someone would refrain from that. Especially because that means you're kinda stuck in a quiet area with them afterwards :p

I've also had situations where my complaint (which was said in an extremely snappy/bitchy way) wasn't taken seriously and they responded back in a super rude way. But the thing is because of the awkwardness it was quiet after so it was successful anyways. And at the end they even apologized so it worked out. But again if you wouldn't feel comfortable approaching it in that way that's cool.

"2143","My docs have always *recommended* therapy, but I haven't taken them up on their recommendations over the past several years.  Therapy really didn't help me much when I was a kid, teenager, or in my early 20s so I don't really think it would help me much right now.  The problem is that I'm too smart for therapy.  I'm not saying that as a point of arrogance, but in order for someone to be able to give me therapeutic advice they're going to have to tell me something I haven't already thought of myself.  As an internet-savvy person that lives primarily in her head I have little faith that I'll find a therapist who doesn't just regurgitate info to me that I've read about elsewhere or already considered.  This is nothing against therapists at all, just a statement that a therapist needs to be matched with a patient on a level of compatibility and serve as a bit of an emotional and lifestyle Sherpa.  I'd need a therapist smart enough to guide me and put me in my place, but I didn't find that person over the course of many years.  I don't want to put forth the time and money to continue what might be a futile search.

So, I declined therapy and it really hasn't been much of an issue.

"2154","I did a career change into data analytics and I struggled (and still do struggle) a lot with this too! A couple of things that helped me kick my butt into the field:

1. I signed up for a generally assembly course (precovid). It allowed me to sit in an environment which forced me to learn the subject as well as be around peers 9 HRS a day where all we talked about was our data assignments and helped each other with tasks. 
2. All of my projects I did in the course &amp; post-course were centered around topics I love! Now --- this is the tricky part --. Be careful of getting caught up on which topic/project you want to work on. It's hard to restrain yourself from changing your mind especially at the beginning of the project when you start to struggle. Just keep reminding yourself that this is a project you want to accomplish. Give yourself milestone rewards. It takes a lot of self-discipline. ***In my opinion, learning by projects helped me 10x more than skimming online videos.***

"2179","HI XD Yeah, I followed you here from thebutton and now I see this was a long time ago, but I guess I wanted to also thank you for the inadvertent referral to this sub.  Plus, I guess we all have our ways of dealing with our stuff, so why not share.

My disclaimer is that I've been medicated for ADD for about a year now, so I'm partly a bit more on top of my shit now thanks to that, BUT most of what that has provided is the clarity to rearrange my life to mitigate the remaining symptoms.

The biggest thing for me is to keep things simple.  I'm nowhere near having a routine that I can consistently adhere to, even on meds (hell, half the time I forget to take them, because... I haven't taken them yet? Hilarious irony), BUT ditching all the unnecessary STUFF really helps.

I keep my kitchen counters as minimal as possible.  There is still the initial hurdle to overcome of actually STARTING the dishes/cleaning, but the achievement factor is proportionally much higher if clear counter actually means clear counter - for me, instant gratification is important to starting tasks, it isn't much of a motivator if the end result is also kinda cluttered.  (I also 100% Steam achievements - that mentality can be harnessed!)

Laundry has actually been my most noticeable change since meds.  And I can't express how pleased I was when I realised that I hadn't had to re-run a load for over a month (my record is 5 times and of course a mountain more had accumulated by the time it was done)!  I still use the shortest time programme to make sure that I don't have time to get absorbed in something else and 'forget' - mine is 27min (+2 for door unlock), so I usually try to make myself clean and sort other stuff while it runs.  If I can stick to chores for that half hour, not only do chores get done (magic, right?), but I also stay on target to actually hang the laundry.

I keep relevant cleaning supplies close to where I need them so that I can't justify not cleaning the bathroom with the excuse that I'd have to find everything I need first.

I'm still very much a work in progress, but these are the things that have eventually evolved as coping strategies for me.  The crucial parts for me are to keep life simple so that nothing is complicating things more than they already are and also to make my space a place that I really love underneath the chaos, so that I have a compelling motivation when I AM mentally able to tackle it.

Still, after a few bad days where everything has piled up it's so hard.  I don't think there's anything that can help that. :(

As for cooking, I cannot help.  Grocery shopping consumes 6 hours of my day if I'm not supervised and my boyfriend has taken over everyday meals - I love to cook fancy food, but the daily grind is such a frustrating struggle for me.  We kinda have a few 'house meals' now that are easy to throw together and don't require thinking, so I'm getting better at those.  I can give you some recipes if you're interested.  Also, CLEAN WHILE YOU COOK.  OMG there is nothing worse than ALL the dishes at the end.

AND try to start chores in the morning if you can, before you even touch anything else.  If I sit down at my computer or 'just watch one tv show' in the morning my whole day is gone.  Morning routine is my next 'to fix' thing.  Also, I read about capsule wardrobes recently and I totally think that would make my life better.

Anyway.
I don't have to apologise for my ADD ramblings here - how refreshing! XD  I hope at least a little bit of that can help.  I wish I had found this sub a looooong time ago... or hell, even been diagnosed at a point where someone could help me.","cqsttti",2,1430327740,"2015-04-29 17:15:40"

You mentioned being in college. College is often one of the best times for people (in the US) to seek out mental healthcare as most colleges have counseling services included or at low cost. Also, if your school has a psychology program (especially a grad level psych program), I would recommend trying to see if there's anyone there doing research on ADHD, doing neuropsych stuff, or working with kids/teens.

Unfortunately, it can be really hard to generalize that  kind of  advice.

For example, if a student is having a hard time memorizing details, I might suggest flash cards. On the other hand some students will memorize things without having a clue what it all means, so I don't want to encourage flash cards for those students. Some students have issues with both.

"2243","Hi! Ive been really struggling with those for the last few years but I've found something that's been helping me pull out of them faster. It may or may not work for you, but it's probably worth a try!

If I can't do what I should be doing for today, then write all of it off and the only thing I need to do today is set up tomorrow. If I have a good start in the morning I'm more likely to have a better day tomorrow and pull out of the spiral, so I'll even just spend 10 mins packing my bag for the morning and leaving 2 options out for me to study first thing in the morning (I'm a uni student) and gym clothes. And getting an early night sleep...

The next morning I've actually woken up earlier because I went to bed early and I have the time to chill in bed for half an hour, have some caffeine, wake up in peace. Then I get up once I'm bored - and I feel relaxed because it's early and I know I prepared my choices for the morning so I'm less likely to hide from the day by staying in bed for hours - and I get to choose which do I fancy, study or exercise, and if I study, which one of the two options? I leave just enough choice I do find an option I prefer in the morning, but not too much choice I freak out and get overwhelmed. If I have no choices, I pick the other option 'phone' which is bad. 

And then I've either done 15 mins exercise in the gym or half an hour studying first thing in the morning, and when I get bored I tend to swap to one of the other choices because it's right there and I'm aware of it. And then once I get hungry enough I'll stop, shower, breakfast, go to practical class or whatever. And then the day feels really good and I'm much happier and oh look, I had a productive day, yesssss!

But literally, none of that happens if I don't set it up and leave myself choices and get enough sleep and get up early enough. If I just go to bed and think I'll sort it out in the morning, I'm just sitting at my desk staring at my phone. Which is what I'm doing now. Which is unhelpful. And I know that's because I didn't set up yesterday because yesterday was a shit day and I just avoided all evening and then went to bed later than I should have. So today will probably be shit. Dammit. 

But that's ok, because tonight I'll set up tomorrow. And it'll be ok.","f5zwxc1",1,1572592500,"2019-11-01 07:15:00"

"2252","I wouldn't rely on professional diagnoses as a good indicator of whether or not you're autistic. The reason autistic women are often thought to be undiagnosed is because they mask. The same would apply for many autistic men. 

Masking is basically when you learn to hide your autistic traits by applying conscious effort into understanding various social cues, norms, and rules, and then applying them in a logical manner depending on the situation; essentially the opposite to how most people socialise. This is why most autistic people aren't perceived as autistic, and may not even know they're autistic themselves, until you get to know them personally, or they're open about it.

For example: I still possess a fair amount of my social intuition, and it's similar to that of neurotypicals, but for things like understanding what to say next in conversation, understanding certain body language, and what metaphors and body language I should use are primarily conscious for me, I have to apply logic to understand when to utilise them, whereas for most people, it's an entirely subconscious process with little to no conscious effort.

I'm autistic, but until I was fifteen, no professionals believed it. It took me several assessments with different people to finally get a diagnosis. Unfortunately, professionals tend to misunderstand being autistic, and will often assume that a child isn't autistic if it's not immediately obvious.

It's also common for ASD to be mistaken for ADHD, and ADHD to be mistaken for ASD, as symptom expression is similar, and they're very closely genetically related. And, although I'm not assuming this to be true, it's possible that you were diagnosed with ADHD mistakenly. However, at the same time, ASD and ADHD are commonly co-morbid with each other, so one can possess both, although there is a difference between autistic ADHD and just ADHD.","g0q22ek",1,1596834919,"2020-08-07 21:15:19"

I've been through so many jobs I've lost count,  had many times of unemployment and depression because I did not know what the hell was wrong with me. For 55 years. But knowing now what it actually is, that I'm not just a lazy, stupid freakoid, it actually helps immensely. There's a reason all those things happened, and now I have tools to combat my adhd symptoms. We can do this!

"2263","Assuming that blogger is correct -- his fear that the FDA will lump ADHD stimulants in with opioids -- his quoted passage allays that fear. 

He quotes the  American Academy of Neurology in talking about his fears. It's actually a great, hopeful comment.

Sure, the AAN is advocating for a 14 day prescription period for non-chronic patients, but also a 90-day period for chronic patients. If you have ADHD, that's a permanent condition, aka a chronic condition.

If the FDA would allow 90-day prescriptions for ADHD stimulants, that would be a huge, beneficial change over the current one-month rule for schedule II drugs.

&gt; I have hand a PHYSICAL SCRIP to the pharmacist every month

Something is up with that. It's not a federal regulation. Doctors commonly electronically transmit prescriptions to a pharmacy for schedule II drugs (ADHD prescriptions).","f7y60e3",1,1574087427,"2019-11-18 14:30:27"

Woodcock Johnson test isn't very good...can't distinguish a psychological problem from a working memory deficit thru ADD.) Personal experience, of getting the wrong diagnosis.

I had the same thing happen with my fifth LSD trip as you. Completely renormalized all my personal issues, concentration and working memory are through the roof, as is endurance. (this is 5-6 days AFTER. So it's a conditioned thing, not medicated, now.)

I tried every ADD med out there: Concerta, Strattera, Ritalin, Ritalin XR, Adderall, Adderall XR. It was completely useless and kicked up my nervousness, made me obsess over everything (OCD-like symptoms) and TOTALLY missed the point. What you need, first, is a good psychiatrist, a great one, to make sure that you're ACTUALLY ADD, and not fucked up other ways.

Think of it in terms of the Tao, if you have something wrong that you can't know is wrong, LSD could aggravate it unless you made excessively careful precautions and a very disciplined study programme pre-dosing.
It hit me like a freight train too (the LSD) about 5 days ago. Tremendous results though. I scaled up 200ug, 400 ug, 400ug, 700ug, 420-600ug (last trip.)

For me, it was psychological-subconsious thing. I got in touch with my emotions, and that was that. Find an insanely great shrink, fast! Took me 10 years to fix it (I'm 25 now, so I spent the majority of my intelligent life in your position.)","c88porf",1,1359922034,"2013-02-03 20:07:14"

"2359","I have a strong belief that I have ADHD too. I only started suspecting I have ADHD about a year ago. A few months ago I went to my new doctor and explained her my situation. She gave me a referral right away on the first visit. I tried coping with my ADHD by changing the way I live and put more structure in my life and with supplements without medication and I have improved a lot. But I'm still not completely satisfied. I hope to get medication soon so I can find out if it will improve my life.



I know how you feel. You feel helpless because everything you try to do is either really difficult or doesn't seem to work. A lot of people think about suicide because sometimes life can be tough. It has crossed my mind as well but there are too many people that love me and now it's just an incredibly stupid idea. You need to just hang in there.



I have never been fired but there has been 1 occasion where I didn't want to meet with the demands of my job because I was going to end up doing stuff that was going to bore me to death (so they didn't extend my contract) and another occasion where they didn't extend my contract because I worked too slow for what they were paying me. I have been without work for long periods and struggled finding other work because I just didn't want to end up with another boring 9 to 5 job listening to some idiot telling me what to do while making tons of money off of me. I have my own company now and it is very exciting.

"2360","We cannot and will not diagnose anyone.  You need to speak with a trained professional to determine if you have ADHD or not.  Read the [Wiki page on the Diagnosis Process](https://np.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/diagnosis) for more information on finding a doctor and other steps.

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

"2363","I went my whole bachelors unmedicated and got good grades. What got me through:

-Becoming nocturnal for 3 years as I had less distractions and no friends awake 

-Being addicted to the adrenaline rush of leaving every assignment to the last minute, cramming a semesters worth of lectures and tutorials for every exam the night before or day of.

-Masochistically enjoying the feeling of constantly redlining with stress while also hating it and my life. Being stressed out of my mind made me productive and gave me drive to get things done.  I just hated my existence at the same time. But enjoyed the suffering too because I got stuff done.

-Increasing my alcohol intake to very high levels progressively through my degree.  By 3rd year I am pretty sure I would have qualified as an alcoholic due to the amount I was having. It helped me “relax” from being so highly stressed for a while, and also made me less distracted while doing assignments or studying. Some of my best work was done drunk at 4am. 

-Luck

As you can see it’s not a positive list. I didn’t get diagnosed with ADHD till after I graduated. Medicated now and doing my Masters, and I still struggle with a lot of stuff, but it’s way better than before.




TL:DR - Constant Adrenaline, High Alcohol Intake, Being Nocturnal, Constant Stress and Luck got me good grades. 3/10 don’t recommend.","dskv90u",1,1515778033,"2018-01-12 17:27:13"
"2364","A psychiatrist will probably be your best bet, especially if you can find one who specializes in ADHD.  Most, if not all, probably accept patients without insurance, but I'm not 100% sure on that since that's never been an issue for me, thankfully.  I'd call around and find out.


You can also try seeing your GP, if you have one, but they might be iffy on prescribing you meds for ADHD.  It's an option to look into, though, if the psychiatrist doesn't work out.  I used to see mine for my ADHD, and it worked out fine until I needed an antidepressant as well, since he wasn't comfortable prescribing both at the same time.


I was initially diagnosed around the same age and year as you, (8 and 98,) and I had a similar reaction to what they put me on.  Do you remember what you took?  Ritalin was the big thing around then, but there are a lot more options now.  Concerta, Adderall, Strattera, Welbutrin, Desoxyn, Vyvanse.  Probably more than that, but hell, remembering just those is a good enough accomplishment for me today, haha.


As for being diagnosed again, yes, you will, but since you were diagnosed as a kid, it won't be like how it was back then.  No batteries of tests or anything.  Things that'll help expedite your diagnosis:

- Having paperwork from your initial diagnosis.  I had a 10 page psychological report from back then that included my test results and my first diagnosis of ADHD.

- Bringing in one of your parents/guardians/whoever was responsible for you at the time of you initial diagnosis, if you can, to your evaluation.  Your doctor will want to know how you were as a kid, how you did with school, homework, and at home.  How you reacted to your medication.  Stuff like that.  My memory of that period isn't great, for various reasons, so I brought my mom with me.  Having someone there who was in charge of you back then to help remember is really helpful.

- If you can't do the previous, due to your parents/whoever not living near you or something, getting them to write out a description on how you were may work too.  Some of the questions mom was asked were things like; how did she do in school?  Did she do her homework easily?  Chores?  How outgoing was she?  Did she have many friends?  What lead you to her initial diagnosis?  Did her teachers have anything to say about her behaviour?  Did she act out?  Is there any history, diagnosed or simply potential, of ADHD in her family?  Stuff like that.

- If the last one isn't possible as well, you might try doing something similar.  Writing it out may help you remember more.  I didn't do this myself, but I kind of wish I had.


Anyway, I hope this has been helpful, if a little rambley.  Good luck!","cbscm25",1,1377102421,"2013-08-21 16:27:01"

From kindergarten to 7th grade, the biggest problem was my antisocial behavior, poor emotional regulation and aggression. My grades were fine. Math was never my strongest subject but being bad at it was never enough to bring me down. 
In high school my behavior mellowed out. I was dual enrolled in the local community college in junior year and finished my associates a couple of months after I got my diploma. That was the time I started slacking really in all kinds of subjects, even the ones I had the talents for. I could feel myself slipping and I began to see that being ""gifted"" and talented wasn't going to cut it anymore, buy for some reason I've never been able to grow the hell up in time to avoid failing classes at university or still being jobless in my 20s.

Motivation isn't related to ADHD directly. Medication provides you the tools you need to be *able* to do things.

Lots of people end up hopeless because they are used to failing (because of ADHD) and none of the organizational/motivational strategies work in people with ADHD. But that's something you need to work on separately. 

&gt; So I had the second session with a psychologist today, and honestly walked away from it feeling worse than when I went in. 

That's not auspicious. Did you not click with the therapist? 

I've had therapy sessions that were upsetting. Whether this was useful/necessary is up to you since I don't have the details.","d8ztzxf",13,1476933762,"2016-10-20 03:22:42"
"2410","Much better. I have my days like anyone, and managing ADHD is still a huge part of my life. I still get really frustrated and depressed at times, deal with low-energy and all that. But getting on medication gave me the energy I needed to enroll back in university, and get a job (it was just a job in a liquor store but it was a great stepping stone job while I finished school).

It’s really important to have responsibilities that you have to attend to. When you have ADHD and you feel you don’t have the energy to do things, you often won’t do them. With work or school, you don’t have an option - you have to show up. And while that idea is stressful, it’s a really really good thing for people who struggle with this kind of thing. 

If you struggle with anxiety, the prospect of getting a job, any job, can be a really scary thing. I was scared of interacting with customers, them asking me questions I wouldn’t know the answer to, or dealing with impatient people who would be angry we didn’t have the beer they liked. I wanted so badly to back out and and avoid any sort of discomfort. Same with school. Thinking about how much effort I would have to put in to get a degree was overwhelming. But running away from all that only would have resulted in more misery.

Not sure if you have a job at the moment, but if you don’t try to get one. I know it’s hard with the pandemic so depending on your circumstances may not be possible. Having a reason to get up every day (something you can’t opt out of) and a daily routine will really benefit your mental health.","gnxack2",1,1613678507,"2021-02-18 20:01:47"
"2411","Go for it! I live in Melbourne so it can be pretty hard to get commercial work, but there's plenty of student and indie films to fill my resume.

*Essay incoming!*

I'm only starting to take it seriously this year as I graduated from high school last year. I'm currently getting into shape and waiting for my hair to regrow (thyroid disfunction), so I can't give much insight into doing it as a job... But I've done a fair bit of voice acting and some school plays and I absolutely love it!

There is always something new and exciting (also why I picked youth work too). New people to work with, new roles to play, new locations, etc! There can be times where it's draining and my concentration and memory goes down the toilet, but overall it's great.

I plan to go to an acting school next year when I wrap up my youth work studies and that will be another further year of studying. It's not required to go to a school, but it can definitely be beneficial (some form of acting classes is a must though), especially when they do a showcase for potential agents at the end of the study.

After finishing that and saving a decent amount I would like to go to LA for pilot season though. Don't know where you live but there's plenty of opportunity in the US. A great place to start though, regardless of country, is any local community theatres or student films. They're great for you to get experience and something to put on your CV.

Most important thing: very few people take 100mg of foquest in Toronto and id suspect the situation is similar in the rest of Canada. Most pharmacies will need to special order it.  So be proactive about refills. You may need to wait a couple days- especially if you fill on a Friday. 

I can’t say how you’ll respond. Everyone is different. It’s always best to look at longer term outcomes in addition to how you experience symptoms moment to moment. Keep in mind if the dose it too high you may find that your symptoms end getting worse on it, or that the improvements are marginal but the side effects are worse. Ie diminishing returns. 

My main issue with foquest is that it has some gaps in the coverage for me - in the morning and afternoon of a couple hours a piece. But I do prefer taking a single pill.

I was maybe 5 weeks into the job, as a part timer around classes.  The day before the owner of the company had asked me to bring a couple parts from the office to where he was working on a customer site (first time on site for me, I had been doing board level electronic repair upto that point only.). The intent was I hand off the part, and go back to the office.  He tells me to stay, and learn.

It gets stupid late that night, and he, the customer, and I all call it.  Head home.

On the way up in the morning, he asks if I want to go full time, as a bench and service tech.  (What I was doing, and also going out to customer site for on site diagnostic/repair if possible/installation/modification).  Once my jaw came back into my head, I accepted.  Of course after I graduated.

From that job, after about 18 months, I got a better offer from a customer went there for a while (I was TOLD by my soon to be boss, AND his boss to apply, and they would back the app), while there, got my to date only raise, was offered basically the department I was in, AND the IT department they wanted to start, told them where to shove the entire company, went back to the service job for about 2 years, leading the robot division, until my boss took on a job we shouldn't have taken, against everyone's advice for way under what we should have charged.","eha6ni6",1,1551138215,"2019-02-25 23:43:35"

Also try discussing the topic of medication with your current counselor. Tell him that you feel the current approach isn't helping and you want to explore a medicinal approach in conjunction with your talk therapy. Gauge his response.  If he seems open,  he will likely refer you to a psychiatrist in the practice to help out. If not, don't be afraid to seek a second opinion. You are there to get better. If its not working,  you need to change something. 

One of the things that helps me during my sessions is to talk to my dr about myself as if I'm a third person (i.e. A friends child) that i am working with the dr to address issues. I try to approach each issue unbiased, and question the advice/opinions in a scientific way. I always want my dr to explain to me why she thinks this new medicine/therapy might help.  I take notes during my session and i do my own research.  I offer my own ideas. Think of your counselor/doctor as a teammate.  You are working together to find the right solution.

 I'd encourage you to check your impressions with the person that you're empathizing with, even if you're usually spot on. As connecting as it is to know someone understands, it can be disconnecting to have someone sure they understand when they don't. So that'd be saying ""is it like this?"" Rather than ""it's like this"" to give the person space to elaborate or correct you if they want. Some people might want to correct you even if you are right but they weren't trying to go so deep so fast (like saying that they weren't enraged, they were just really annoyed) and in those situations it's probably more connective to reflect what they're saying rather than what they're feeling.","g23hbrw",1,1597841719,"2020-08-19 12:55:19"

Stimulants *can* cause psychotic symptoms in the general user, there need not be a discernable predisposition toward 'schizophrenia'. 

See this brief by the National Institute of Mental Health:

&gt;In 2007, the FDA required that all makers of ADHD medications develop Patient Medication Guides (View the available guides on the FDA website ). The guides must alert patients to possible heart and psychiatric problems related to ADHD medicine. The FDA required the Patient Medication Guides because a review of data found that ADHD patients with heart conditions had a slightly higher risk of strokes, heart attacks, and sudden death when taking the medications. **The review also found a slightly higher risk (about 1 in 1,000) for medication-related psychiatric problems, such as hearing voices, having hallucinations, becoming suspicious for no reason, or becoming manic. This happened to patients who had no history of psychiatric problems.**

http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications/index.shtml

This is prevelance rate is likely underestimated due to the problematic nature of pharmaceutical drug research, we documented by Marcia Angell, former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine and countless others (see the whole series on Tamiflu in the BMJ).

----

ADHD med cost far less than $3,000 dollars per year once you figure in the cost to insurance companies that you do not see but instead pay in your monthly premiums.  The real cost to individuals are often between $600 to $2700 depending on how good your insurance is, once you factor in copays, driving, doctor visits, etc.  Yet the increase in productivity in both children and adults for successfully treated ADHD is far better than this $600 to $2700 a year.  Just ask people who make more money at their jobs for they are able to do a harder job or are more productive, or a college student who does better on his college classes, or the health of a parent for they have less stress in their lives for if their kids thrive they are happy but when their kids are suffering parents stress out and this can affect other health conditions.

Of course commenting on reddit posts, saying that you have to dump him is understandable, but it is also your life and since none of us know each other, we can't take into account the totality of your relationship. However, I will quote the show Bojack Horseman and say ""When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags."" 

Being in a relationship with someone, we can fixate on the good things about them while ignoring other more toxic personality traits and interactions. It is just like confirmation bias, where we accept evidence for the things we already believe and ignore what does not fit into our worldview. We turn a blind eye to controlling behavior and think mainly of the times the significant other has supported us or made us laugh unexpectedly. But there is a tipping point where you realize the relationship has become more strife and pain than happiness. That day something shifts back to reality, and you can see it for what it is instead of how you wish it was. If that day has not come I hope you have every happiness. And if it has, additionally I wish you strength as well.","gupvqb0",1,1618577498,"2021-04-16 12:51:38"

You literally need to overeat instead of just eating until you are full. You also need high calorie snacks throughout the day as mentioned by others.

Find a gym and start working out too. Check in over at /r/fitness for help. 

With regards to medication, the only thing I can suggest is medicating only when you really need it, and when you do take it time it so that you can overeat before you take it and when it wears off. I think it's the leangains diet that has a method of gaining weight with a fasting period each day so look in to that too.

-Ask your dad to take primary custody of you until you turn 18/graduate high school. This might be easy or difficult, depending on your custody/family situation. 

-Or, if your dad will allow it and you turn 18 soon, wait until you turn 18 and move in with him. 

-Get meds on your own and keep them at your school/in your locker. (This one is a risk in that most public schools do not allow students to have prescription meds on campus unless registered with the office/school nurse. However, if your school is a fairly good one and you're discrete, the chances of anyone searching your locker are quite low.) 

-Talk to a social worker. You may have certain legal rights to treatment, since ADHD is under ADA protection.

-You can also ask your school to re-evaluate your 504 since it isn't working. The specific process for that varies by school, but talk to your counselor and they should be able to get the ball rolling. 

-Focus on treating your ADHD ""naturally"" the best you can--magnesium, zinc, vitamin C, daily exercise, caffeine (but cut out the sugar--start taking your coffee black), etc.

"2696","Sure thing! I think one thing that's significant for my case of ADHD was that it was comorbid with depression, which caused me to have low self-esteem and a lack of empathy. I thought people didn't care for me and I didn't care for others either so it didn't matter if I lied. Some counseling, some very intense life changes/events, and methyl-b12 (DEFINITELY make sure you have a balanced diet/no vitamin and fat deficiencies!) have helped me feel happier and more empathetic. If I care for the person, I want to present myself in the best way possible. That means planning ahead and finding ways to cope with ADHD so I can do what I say I will do. It also means being honest as it's become a greater value of mine than 'saving face' so to speak. Overall (at least for me) it is important to have a set of values and people who support you (even if they don't know you have ADHD).

Also running in the mornings helped a lot. Now that I have a stress fracture and can't run, I'm noticing that I am a lot more lethargic which causes me to just be less focused and just tired. I can't wait to get back into it!

What I find is, when I'm having a really bad time, or what seems like a bad time, same as you- I'll go to great lengths to explain the pains of having the condition- and there are many.

But I also appreciate my unique personality and charisma, and the fact that it makes me me. If I could have the condition taken away, would I? Maybe...or maybe not.  Maybe I actually like the ups and downs. Or maybe I just think I do because I have ADHD. Huh.

On-topic though, you're totally right, and what you said with regards to medication is on-point.

You say your current meds are helping you focus, which is great! But you're still struggling with the emotional dysregulation, so then the question is, is it worth going through the hassle to find meds that focus more on that? Would you be willing to stick to them for a period while also exploring other ways to cope with the emotional parts, like therapy? As you said yourself, no single medicine is going to fix everything about your ADHD, so in my head at least, you then have to choose what bothers you the most, and find something that works for that, then find coping mechanisms to handle the stuff that isn't as important to you.

I suggest you try a bunch of different sports until you find some you really enjoy and will look forward to: martial arts, tennis, yoga, swimming, skating, rock climbing, hiking, dancing, whatever is easy to do in your area. Just go for a brisk walk on the days you can't engage in your other activities.

When I changed from take-out to cooking at home (for both health and budget reasons), I started off by roasting a small whole chicken once every week or two - it's super easy and it cooks itself. Combined with a big bag of mixed salad greens or baby spinach and I had 4 or 5 days worth of easy to make meals with a variety of flavors. For Mexican, combine them with salsa, avocado, a little pepper jack cheese, and a corn tortilla. For Italian, combine the chicken with tomato sauce, pasta, grated parmesan, and serve the greens on the side. In warm weather, keep the chicken cold and add yogurt, cucumber, and fresh dill on a pita, or kalamata olives &amp; feta cheese to make it Greek, plus there are countless varieties of chicken salad. Also, fast and easy is to stir fry some mixed vegetables with ginger, soy sauce, and hot pepper flakes and serve it over microwave rice for Chinese. I forgot to mention I usually had a few types of plain frozen vegetables on hand - they are almost as nutritious as fresh, and they don't go bad for a very long time, and they cook in a few minutes. On the 3rd or 4th day, I'd cut up and freeze any meat that was left in 4 oz portions, and if I had the energy, I'd use the carcass to make chicken stock to keep in the freezer...then later you can make a quick soup with whatever leftover vegetables, beans, or pasta you have around. If you have no energy at all, you can just throw some of the chicken on the greens with olive oil and vinegar. 

I am the slowest cook in the universe (people have literally pushed me out of the way because watching me was making them crazy), and besides the cooking time to roast the chicken or boil the stock, all these meals are ready to eat in 15 mins or less. Once you gain some confidence, keep onion, celery, bell pepper, carrot, tomato, mushroom, garlic, and ginger on hand and you have the base for an incredible variety of foods, still ready in 20 mins or less.

tl;dr: 1) find a sport you like. 2) Roast a chicken, buy a bag of greens, and some frozen vegetables and you always have a healthy meal in minutes.","dtmurdy",8,1517592707,"2018-02-02 17:31:47"

It is often reported that if a person hasn't consumed much food during the day or is dehydrated from not drinking enough, these side effects during the comedown are worse then if they were fed and properly hydrated. You can google or wiki comedown side effects as there are too many for me to list here. I should note that not all people experience a noticeable comedown, and even if you are fasting, you are not guaranteed to have any of these effects. Also, and maybe more importantly the smaller the dose, the less the comedown is, as you said you just started the medication, you are likely on a smaller dose than most.

As for the effectiveness of the drug while fasting, stimulants use a larger amount of sugar in your brain compared to when you are not on them. This is why it is generally encouraged that people eat a sugar containing foods while they are taking them, as once this sugar is depleted, the fastest way to regain it is through eating some form of sugar. With you fasting you wont be able to do this, and since your body has a difficult time keeping up with that demand, you will likely notice the medication to not be as effective when you don't eat. (This is similar to the reason that some diets will make you drowsy, but not exactly tho.)

"2725","&gt;Talk to your doctor about taking a medication called inderal

Inderal is a trademark name *it also goes by the name Propranolol (generic name).*

I take this drug *as needed*.  It can be used daily, or as a preventive measure (you know you are going to be in a stressful situation) or as a treatment after a stressor (such as a panic attack). I used to suffer panic attacks.  I no longer do, and thus my use of this medication has very much declined for I do not need it like I used to.

Good Med.  We do not know if this med will be the best for you, but it should be something you ask your doctor.

"2778","I have not undertaken any kind of real structured psychotherapy.  I had been seeing a school counselor for a couple of months and not making any progress when she suggested I get ADHD testing.  I spent a long time after that pursuing the meds first before therapy, because I felt like I was just not in the right chemical state of brain to be able to stick with any structured program.  I have spent many many hours deconstructing irrational patterns of thought that I had been able to identify in myself.  My wife has helped with this, and while not being a medical professional, she's one of the most sensible people I know.  She's tried to help me understand the techniques that she uses to get things done so much more effectively than I do, but I never continue to apply them after the first couple of days.  It's plausible that much of the difference between our abilities in this regard is chemical -- for instance, she has a medical disorder which results in having *too much* noradrenergic activity, sort of like naturally being amped up all the time.    

I have undertaken, at various times both before and after my diagnosis, a variety of chronic exercise programs.  I ran track and cross country in high school, tried a year of wrestling, a semester of rowing in college, lifted weights fairly seriously on and off during college, have had periods during the summers where I would work out 5 days a week and not miss a workout for months.  I have never experienced any lasting improvement in symptoms during these periods.  At best, I would have an acute 'post-workout push' that could get me through starting a particularly long-procrastinated task, but it lasted about an hour at most.  I also found that the exercise time would usually cut into my few 'total productive hours' for the day, as opposed to cutting into useless time and fitting in around intellectual work.  The longer I would exercise, the less I would do anything else on my list.

I've also tried a lot of interventions on my diet and sleep before my diagnosis.  I helped my wife figure out ways around some of her dietary challenges (food intolerances) and we basically put ourselves on a number of 'science diets'.  I've tried every reasonable combination of macronutrients short of full keto, de facto intermittent fasting, many supplements.  These things help with some minor physical issues, but nothing for the ADHD (as I would expect -- the evidence base for dietary interventions in ADHD seems quite weak).  As for sleep, I sleep way too much all the time and never wake up rested, people have been telling me I look tired all my life.  I've tried just about every reasonable sleep schedule short of the Uberman, and all the usual stuff about regular bedtimes and light in the morning and dark in the evening and melatonin and blah blah blah.  Even got checked for sleep apnea because I snore like a monster, but that appeared negative.  All I've gotten out of out of this line of inquiry is that sleeping for fewer than ten hours a night seems to cause mild performance decreases compared to baseline, but I've also done some of my best work at 4 in the morning. 

I have watched that video, in fact I've read some of Barkley's articles and about half of his book 'ADHD and the nature of self control'.  I think Barkley's stuff is better suited to addressing the hyperactive or combined ADHD types.  He seems to believe that the central problem in the disorder is a deficit in behavioral inhibition, but with ADHD-PI or something even more depression-like than that, I find a lot more problems with behavioral activation.  

Thank you for not mentioning mindfulness meditation, which everyone throws out for every damn thing.  I'm very skeptical of the state of clinical research on meditation, it seems like a fad field with low standards of evidence and a lot 'we believe this should work so it must'.  My extended family is full of new-agey spiritual 'wanderers', and all their meditation never seems to have helped them get their heads out of the clouds or hold down a steady job, so I guess I'm somewhat prejudiced in this regard, but trying to keep an open mind.  

I'm certainly coming back around to a re-evaluation of other approaches I had put on the back burner, as I've been having such a bad time with the drugs.","dc209jr",1,1483662426,"2017-01-06 00:27:06"

"2789","To be fair, I have experienced EXACTLY what you are concerned with. 

My last attempt in getting assessed and treated for ADHD resulted in my psychiatric nurse practitioner wanting to “treat my depression” before exploring ADHD treatment options. And she stuck to it.

This resulted in exploring two new (for me) off-label depression treatment options (typical anti-depressants cause me severe side effects) then one more-so typical depression med (Wellbutrin) that I’d already tried, and was somewhat helpful, but stopped due to weird side effects that stacked with time. (Hmmm the antidepressant that works on norepinephrine and dopamine actually helped some, how odd, who would have guessed /s) 

The meds didn’t help me, gave me side effects galore, disrupted my life to the point of feeling like I lost a whole year and almost my mind, and I am still untreated for ADHD and still struggling. The level of psychological disruption from the experience honestly had me giving up/scared to go back and try to get help again until recently.

So you are not entirely off base in your concerns.

I think the key is if one doctor is unwilling to explore this option with you, get a second opinion, or a third, or a fourth. Make a conscious decision to not let them bully you into trying SSRI’s again or another depression treatment, even if they dangle the carrot saying they will “try this after you try this”. You want their professional opinion and assistance with potentially treating ADHD, not depression right now.

Express that you have tried multiple SSRI’s before, that they did not help with what you are currently struggling with and have negatively impacted your functioning to a notable degree, and your goals in treatment (that your current state is impacting your ability to pursue very normal, achievable goals in school that you feel you would be otherwise capable of, and that your concerns are focus/motivation based).

You understand what has not worked for you in the past, the pain and distress it has caused you, and what symptoms are negatively impacting your day to day functioning. 

I feel like doctors will be much more willing to lower your dose as an adult telling them you feel like your dose might be too high, as opposed to being a child and not being able to really articulate why this drug is making you feel bad.","ewjk9t2",1,1565467927,"2019-08-10 20:12:07"

You can lookup information online about the supplements. 

Vyvanse is similar, and is supposed to be even more consistent than adderall. 

However, I want to be really clear about one thing - adderall kills my ability to be creative and speak well and connect like I can without it. 

I hear vyvanse also can do the same to some people. 

Adderall is available in IR form, which is better IMO, because you can use it as needed. 

Vyvanse is long acting and works all day, and if it kills your verbal ability, then the whole day is fucked. Therefore adderall IR will be better a better start, since it wears off in 6hrs or so.

Also: money. Wellbutrin is rather expensive, and the generic versions seem to work worse.

- Oh, new project!
- I'm bored of that project and people aren't getting back to me with the info I need.  I could nudge them or...
- Start another project.  Get bored.
- And then stuff just... sits.  And I find myself doing anything at my workstation that I can that isn't work.  Very little is blocked on the internet, I'm faking serious faces while reading the first half of a funny article, or watching John Oliver on youtube.
- Halfheartedly start third project.
- Self-consciousness starts to flood in through the gaps and I start to think everyone knows I'm screwing around.
- I'm a flurry of activity for a month or so, closing stuff off, taking work home, giving others advice on how to do their work; I have become a guru, closing files like a madwoman!  Everyone lines up to pat me on the back.  Boss takes me out for a drink.
- Sit back and rest on my laurels for awhile.  The mundane stuff starts to slide, my desk becomes piles again.  And then the cycle starts again.

I like my job, and I consider myself very lucky to have kept it this long.  I have my diagnosis and I'm working towards making my productivity at work more even.

"2911","Unless insurance is paying for it, brain scans aren't necessary. Only in the past decade have they become a key tool in understanding how the ADHD brain reacts to stimulating and monotonous tasks.  It's certainly fascinating but definitely unnecessary for a diagnosis.

Additionally, one should never feel obligated to have others fill out anything that might indicate that they are seeing a physician and/or suggesting what condition they are seeing the doctor for.  While it helps to have input from others, I'd personally draw the line at immediate family.  Unless your plan is to claim an exemption under ADA, there is no reason to let a teacher know.

In response to the hyperactivity you mentioned. More and more research is suggesting that while these 2 issues share similar symptoms and may be treated similarly, they are in fact different and should be treated as such. I wouldn't focus on it.

"2927","Well I sort of did both in a sense. I'm on meds and they greatly help because I was at the point where just developing tools to deal with ADHD was not enough.

I was very high functioning to begin with and coupled with meds and couple tricks I've picked up along the way, ADHD is rarely a problem. Sometimes it creeps up on me when I forget to keep myself in check, get lazy and slip up. But then it's easier to rebuild my defenses than without medication.

From what I've gathered here and from my doctors, medication can be tricky. If it works for you, that's awesome, whole new world of possibilities is now available. When they don't, they can make things worse not only because of the side effects but the notion that the medication that supposed to help you doesn't work which adds another layer of stress into your life.

"2928","We feel the neurodiversity movement is harmful to people with ADHD. While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

"2961","Novel ahead:

I experience this almost daily with fibromyalgia. It's extreme for me. I also have disassociative spells. Sometimes I can't tell the difference between brain fog and the onset of disassociation. 

After my recent ADHD diagnosis, the intensity and frequency of my brain fog made more sense. Fibro and ADHD are reaaaal winning combo, haha. One of my antidepressants lists it as a common side effect, too. 

Honestly, stimulant medication has been the only moderate remedy. This is anecdotal, but I also drink yerba mate tea to improve focus. It helped before I started Adderal. 

There are many more reputable sources about yerba mate benefits, and I recommend browsing for them. But this is a quick summary of benefits:

https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-benefits-of-yerba-mate#section3

I notice that my brain fog is MUCH worse when I don't properly hydrate. Drinking water consistently all day makes a difference. Proper sleep help supposedly helps. 

Vitamins and supplements have helped my overall fibromyalgia and ADHD - brain fog included. I don't have a list of what I take on hand. But it's quite easy to find via Google. And it's all inexpensive stuff. 

Other than that, nothing changes it for me. All I can do is use coping skills. I take list making and note taking to the extreme. It pulls thoughts out of the jumbled fog and makes them tangible. Might be worth a shot.

* Get EVERYTHING out of containers. Cut them open if you have to. Use a little vegetable or olive oil to coax viscous liquid foods out.

* Something like [this](https://8b862ca0073972f0472b704e2c0c21d0480f50d3.googledrive.com/host/0Bxd6wdCBD_2tdUdtM0d4WTJmclU/good-and-cheap.pdf) is really helpful for chopping up vegetables and fruit FAST, making it easier to make your own food, especially helpful with batch-cooking or if you tend to find cooking tiring.

* Most of these tips aren't going to help you until you get out of college. You are still learning how life works, and a lot of unpredictable things are going to come up. It's a process. Mistakes will be made. Be kind to yourself. It's OK to use safety nets (e.g., parents) when you need them.

* Booze is mad expensive. Limit it or cut it - if I'm going to drink wine, I tend to mix wine with a little fruit juice. I limit my booze consumption outside the house - not only because it's marked up so much, but because intoxication also leads to poor decision-making, and additional unforeseen expenses.

* It can sometimes be helpful to physically separate cash when budgeting - sorting actual bills into different envelopes, for instance.

Edit: Ahhh, they keep coming

* If you eat fast food, shoot for Taco Bell. Whatever people say about it, it absolutely fills you up in the cheapest possible way. It has the most calories dollar-for-dollar, and you can get a rather decent amount of vegetables in there. The seven-layer burrito is a favorite of my nutritionist friend. For a little more, their cantina menu is fantastic.

*[Freecycle](https://www.freecycle.org/). Also, you may be eligible for food banks or SNAP. Check it out. Many young adults are. Oh! And coops/farmer's markets/ethnic markets for produce.

"2997","I've kind of had two depressions; one was from trauma 10 years ago, it was a deep, dark place for me, and I don't remember much of it at all. I was also 15-18 years old, so it was depression coupled with all of the teenage problems. The way I remember this depression is that I didn't want to leave my room, I didn't want anyone to see me because I felt like a failure (I left school), my mood was so precarious that if I was having an okay day, and my Dad asked me stupid random question like ""Can you stop taking medication yet? Are you better?"" I was crushed and the world was horrific again. This kind of relates to Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, too. I would also feel a complete exhaustion, like burn out. My arms were too heavy to lift sometimes. While most of my projects never went anywhere, I also became very creative. Basically, everything was hard and there was no point in trying. There was no point in living, engaging with others, etc. Oh and I'd sleep, always sleep. Why be awake and face the world when you can sleep and maybe be happy in your dreams?

From here, I was diagnosed with depression for 10 years which hindered the ADHD diagnosis for the last 3 years. I'm only recently diagnosed with ADHD, about 3 months, but I've known since my Mum was diagnosed 3 years ago. I've been on various anti-depressants for 10 years, not sure I've really counted as 'depressed' since it doesn't compare to the initial world-ending depression. Still on anti-depressants and ADHD meds. 

So this 'second' depression, I still get burn out when things get really bad, I feel like I just collect stress and can't release it until I freak out and cry everywhere. I still feel like there's no point sometimes, but I'm able to keep plodding along. At my worst, most recently, I had a few bad 'crashes' where I just felt like there was no point in being alive (I've never really been suicidal, but it was as close to that as I could imagine myself being, and it took me straight back to the original depression kind of feelings). I've had times where I feel like there's nothing beyond uni/work and sleep. I don't remember huge stretches of time when I'm burnt out or depressed. It's like my brain doesn't even have the energy to record things.

Mostly, though, my current depression is reactionary. Someone says something and I fall into a heap and can't cope. I was told last year by a lecturer I had met twice that she thought I was 'too immature' to 'get the most out of this degree' and that I should 'come back next year'. I couldn't have continued knowing that someone who met me twice thought I couldn't do this. I felt like she, being a unit chair and lecturer at a prestigious uni must know me, be able to pick that in me, understand me better than I could. So I took a year off, barely succeeded at anything, and hated myself. I started picking myself back up and by the end of that year, I came back. I'm back at uni, one term in, and it took a lot. I still sit here and go ""What's the point? I've got another year. I've been at uni for at least 6 years, and I still can't do anything"". But I got there. Which I wouldn't have been able to do in the first depression. It would probably have been easier to do now, knowing I'm officially diagnosed with ADHD, but I'm still pretty up and down and medication isn't worked out great yet. 

So, basically, I guess, now, with this depression, everything is still hard, but trying is worth it. And sometimes things are interesting enough that they're not that hard anymore. The depression is what I attribute to the not wanting to bother, not seeing the point, not being 'enough', and never having any confidence in myself. 

And it's also important to understand that we sometimes need downtime, we sometimes need to cry, and we are very, very prone to overexerting ourselves in nearly every aspect of life, so burn out is always nearby, as well as depression, anxiety, stress. So take you time. Find something that relaxes you. I'm still not really sure what relaxes me, so that's been fun trying to figure it out. And also exercise! If you're a fidgeter, try getting an underdesk pedal bike thing or something that you can move around the house for TV or whatever. 

I don't know if that helps at all, I'm feeling pretty down today, so it might just be depressing to read. :/ Iono.","f7axxsd",1,1573545178,"2019-11-12 07:52:58"

All 4 of us in my family—my husband, myself, and both of our sons—have ADHD. But it looks different in all four of us, which is why half of us went undiagnosed for so much longer. I look a lot like what your a doctor expected, with my inability to focus my eyes in conversation, inability to focus period in conversations. A few of my friends have said anyone who doubts I have ADHD just needs to try to have a conversation with me. But, I was a top student, and I am very organized. My husband can focus in conversations and makes eye contact, and seems very quiet. But doing any kind of homework, schoolwork, or paperwork of any kind is excruciating for him. When we got our masters degrees Together, I would be done with a paper on Friday that was due Monday, and he would be working on it all through the night Sunday and ride up to the last minute that Monday. Then our oldest son has a high impulsivity, high emotional deregulation, sensory issues, etc., and school work is torturous for him. Yet our youngest is a top student and doesn’t have the emotional issues, but his brand of high impulsivity is very physical— he tends to grab things (and people) and just DO things without thinking. He’s the one who’s had multiple ER visits as a result.

"3010","Hey OP - I’m going to try to answer some of your questions. My degree isn’t in neuroscience, but I have both studied neuroscience and done research in the area, and I keep up with the research as best I can.

To your first question - there are multiple reasons why your brain may not synthesize enough dopamine and norepinephrine. Neurotransmitters are synthesized from amino acids and there are a variety of things that can go wrong down the line (not enough of the correct amino acids due to diet, inefficient conversions, etc.). Then, the neurotransmitters need to be released into your brain, and after that, they need to bind to a synapse to cause the neuron to fire.

We aren’t 100% sure of the exact cause of ADHD, but numerous twin studies have shown us that ADHD is entirely genetic / environmental. I’m happy to explain more about twin studies if you’re curious - they’re pretty neat.

It’s not surprising that you’re depressed if you have ADHD, unfortunately. It’s very common for adults with ADHD to have one or more comorbidities (anxiety, depression, OCD, etc.). The good news is that many adults find relief from their mood symptoms when their ADHD is treated, which makes sense - not being able to focus or get anything done would certainly make you feel pretty bad about yourself and the world. Also, specifically WRT depression - the current hypothesis is that clinical depression also involves a serotonin imbalance, but that doesn’t mean that you have to have a chemical imbalance to meet the diagnostic criteria.

I also wanted to validate your experience of medication not being enough on its own. Medication definitely makes it easier to form good habits, but you still need to do the work and practice the habits to make them stick. Medication is a bit like filling up your gas tank - it’s going to be nearly impossible to drive anywhere when you’re out of gas, but gas alone isn’t going to navigate your car to your destination. You still need to start the ignition and drive.","gasp6e5",1,1604242654,"2020-11-01 14:57:34"

But recently I’ve seen it evolved into “oh yea I have ADHD too sometimes” with genuinely normal people and that makes my blood boil. Occasionally procrastinating is not the same struggle that we have to go thru,","eqkyz78",3,1560134004,"2019-06-10 02:33:24"
"3035","- If a normal person's line of thought looks like a train track mine resembles the roots of a tree, it's all connected but not in an organized, easy to see way - and it happens fast. 

- Sometimes I get a project in my head and literally cannot escape it until I've finished whatever task I'm focused on, even when there are much more important things to do.

- I'm easily overwhelmed, either by pending tasks / overstimulation / emotions, and basically when I feel something (happiness, rejection, doom) I fucking FEEL it with every fiber of my being.  There's no method or pattern to when or how it will happen though, like with some other disorders that have similar symptoms. 

- It takes me approximately three hours of laying in bed trying to get to sleep on days I've forgotten to take my meds.

-  anecdotally, I almost never close a cabinet or drawer when I'm done getting what I need, if I'm working on a project I'll come into the kitchen at the end of the day and 1/2 the cabinets and four drawers are all just sitting open for no apparent reason.  

- When I'm trying to do basic chores I'll see six other things that could be quickly done which means a task that should take 5 minutes takes an hour or maybe doesn't even get finished if I forgot I was doing that first. 

- Being made to sit down and actively pay attention a movie or show is akin to slow boring torture.  I love movies, but I need to be doing something and end up missing half the plot.  I have found that I can pay attention better if I turn on subtitles.

It's all anecdotal stuff that I could think of off the top of my head, most of which I never knew was ADHD until I was diagnosed and learned more than the common conceptions of it.

"3042","""Both estradiol and progesterone are known to interact with several neurotransmitter systems, including norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine and dopamine (DA)"" So the answer seems like it should be YES, BC and ADHD meds interact given they both affect the same neurotransmitters, do we have research on how, hell NO.

&amp;#x200B;

There's also very few studies on the way that BC affects mood. I'd recommend going non hormonal if possible. But if you have to go hormonal get a estrogen and prog. combo. 

&gt;If progesterone exerted a positive effect on DA baseline levels like estradiol, we would expect an interaction in the opposite direction. As this is not the case, **the most plausible explanation for our findings is that progesterone exerted a negative effect on DA baseline levels,** thereby counteracting the positive effect of estradiol. Multiple findings support a differential effect of estradiol and progesterone on the central nervous system, although their combinatory effect is not clear. Specifically in the dopaminergic system, there is evidence for different modes of action between the two steroids (Morissette et al., [1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508121/#B69)), combinatory but not synergistic effects (Morissette and Paolo, [1993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508121/#B70)), and opposite effects (Fernández-Ruiz et al., [1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508121/#B36)). If progesterone counteracted the influence of estradiol on DA levels, this could have masked the relationship between estradiol and performance, and could explain why our findings don't relate to estradiol levels in a significant manner. Note however, that this could also be the result of a power failure or other factors driving the menstrual cycle effect that weren't taken into account in the present study. Furthermore, also note that the effect size of this interaction with progesterone was rather small and should therefore be interpreted with caution.

The title is obviously clickbait, but the information in there supports what  frog_licker's saying:

&gt;Before he became a scientist, Hart believed that people who use crack generally get hooked on it and thereby lose control of their behavior. But when he looked at the data on patterns of drug use as an academic, he could plainly see that only a small minority of people who try crack become heavy users. “Even at the peak [of] widespread use,” he writes, “only 10–20 percent of crack cocaine users became addicted.”

I don't mean to imply that these drugs are totally safe. I mean to say that ""using an addictive drug"" doesn't seem to be the only risk factor in drug addiction. The user's environment/living conditions and mental state seem to be factors as well.

There probably are people who've gotten addicted to some drug the very first time they tried it. That doesn't mean that this is a universal (or even a common) thing, and I don't think it's helpful for professionals and educators to imply that it is. Some people who go through anti-drug education will end up trying drugs anyway, and most of them will probably *not* get instantly addicted. If they've been led to believe that this is what happens to most drug users, they could get the idea that they're somehow different, that the bad things that happen to other drug users won't happen to them, or that they won't ever get addicted. (And of course, this kind of thinking would be the most dangerous for people who actually *are* at a higher risk for developing an addiction.)","cmk48kl",2,1417631725,"2014-12-03 18:35:25"

"3102","Hey I just my finished testing with a psychologist about a week ago. This how the testing was explained to me:

""Neuropsychological tests evaluate functioning in a number of areas including: intelligence, executive functions (such as planning, abstraction, conceptualization), attention, memory, language, perception, sensorimotor functions, motivation, mood state and emotion, quality of life, and personality styles.""

It was series of different exams, for me some of those exams were naming animals that begin with the letter A, or naming anything that begins with the letter A, recognizing patterns, memorizing lists of items that are repeated to your several times and then categorizing that lists.

For example: repeat all of the items I mentioned that were fruit.

I also had to draw an object based on an image and then was asked to draw the image again without anything to compare it to.

Reading through this sub I've seen some folks have computerized tests.

I recommend looking if your psychologist has a website, maybe some info is there, if not on your first visit which is usually a short interview, they will tell you what to expect then.","d65sjv5",1,1470426251,"2016-08-05 19:44:11"

Exactly, and even shittier is when we're already diagnosed for a long time and need a new doctor, these fucking doctors pull the exact same shit. a person abusing meds wouldn't be on a consistent dosage for as long as me or on meds for as long as me. these doctors are such dicks, and it wouldn't surprise me if a bunch of them actually abused amphetamines in their youth and that's why they're so bias. doctors are so fucking arrogant and bias because they're full of themselves with their training and position of power like even the worst doctor tends to get more respect than the mayor and that just solidifies the way they are. it pisses me off to know end that we have to go through more hoops because of our ADHD when ADHD is enough of a struggle without this crap.

"3134","These show a total lack of understanding about ADHD. ADHD is a neuro developmental disorder and just because you or others perceive it as “wishy washy”, that doesn’t change the neurobiology behind it. ADHD is significantly more than not caring about boring schoolwork. As I said earlier it is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by weak function and structure of the prefrontal cortex circuits, leading to difficulty regulating behavior, attention, and emotion. ADHD is a disorder that displays emotional dysregulation and executive dysfunction due to the difference in brain structure and chemistry. If you or others don’t wish to take stimulants that’s a personal choice, and it’s fine but a totally arbitrary choice. Stimulants increase dopamine and norepinephrine activity, which people with ADHD need. In contrast, someone without ADHD might appear high or even “tweaking” on stimulants but therapeutic doses for people with ADHD just even the playing field and provide us with closer to normal brain chemistry. It’s up to the individual to determine whether or not they want medication.","erhwg3f",3,1560884355,"2019-06-18 18:59:15"

Meditation, however, has helped far more. Mindfulness meditation teaches you to really be in the moment. This helps you keep track of your thoughts before they spill out. 

Another thing I've been trying was to picture myself having three gatekeepers in my mind that sit in the door that my thoughts pour out as words. Each gatekeeper asks the thought a question and it can only pass through if it answers the question right.

 The first gatekeeper asks ""is this true?"" The second asks ""is this kind?
The third is definitely the hardest to answer ""is this necessary?"" 

It's definitely not an overnight solution, it's a lifelong goal. But I'm making improvements and you will too!

Most people find vyvanse smoother and more effective than adderall, some people find them entirely equivalent, and a few people have a preference towards the extra component in adderall over vyvanse because the range in variation of human bodies is pretty large.

Simulants like adderall can be psychologically addictive if you try to chase the euphoria a lot of people get from the first dose or two, or if people aren't satisfied with the subtle effects of a proper dose, but as long as you take it as directed, the risk of physiological addiction is minimal.  It's perfectly safe, however, if you're taking it as directed and making sure to report negative side effects to your doctor.","e8ozv55",1,1540855634,"2018-10-29 23:27:14"

If the med you’re doing has zero changes for you (changes being things like: you seem calmer, you can sleep better, can read a paragraph without wanting to rage quit) then talk with your psychiatrist about changing meds. 

For the stimulant side of things there’s 2 medication sides to work with. Some work better with one over the other and others can do great on both. Talk to your doc. Another cool thing is that each of these medication families have different meds that may work better for you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az-nfET7mBM&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLzBixSjmbc8cGW9p3-elS6uDHv7T0Z2vp

I started the video in the middle on purpose where he talks about the cingulate gyrus and specific areas of the cingulate gyrus called the anterior cingulate (frontal area of the cingulate gyrus).  Well the entire cingulate gyrus see picture below is the emotional gear shifter of the brain.  Taking a small area of the frontal or back area of the brain or the amygadala and magnify it and have one cingulate gyrus area shift the emotion focus from another cingulate gyrus area.

Picture of the cingulate gyrus https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon_Eickhoff/publication/257649110/figure/fig2/AS:281137248260104@1444039751867/Figure-1-Schematic-drawing-of-the-four-region-model-of-the-cingulate-cortex-according-to.png

Well certain parts of the cingulate gyrus are ""hard to shift into"" hard to activate with ADHD without medicine.  Aka this picture which views the ACC from a different angle

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Now beside the Dr. Barkley video I already posted and the one that /u/thousande already linked to here is another lecture from Dr. Thomas Brown on Emotion and ADHD that is important.

* Part 1, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RbYEuJ2Akc

* Part 2, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvN7RBuZW24

* Part 3, Q&amp;A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAYoql1qMT8&amp;t=1475s

* Slides http://learningcenter.unc.edu/ldadhd-services/burnett-seminars/dr-thomas-e-brown-2014/

Note Part 1 talks about motivation and ADHD and Part 2 talks about emotions and ADHD.  Note these lectures are really about the same brain areas with ADHD for we use the anterior cingulate both for activation and creation / escalating new emotions such as creating motivation), and we also use the same brain areas to ""pause"" and de-escalate also known as inhibit emotions.   Note the Anterior Cingulate is not the only brain area that is tied to this, for example the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex and the Dorsal Medial Prefrontal Cortex are wired directly into the Anterior Cingulate as a starting point, and then the ACC as part B, and then these areas into the Basal Ganglia part C, and then to the Thalamus Part D, and then it repeats back towards the Prefrontal Cortex.  Well all of those brain areas are implicated often in the ADHD research.  Also the similar parallel loop of the prefrontal cortex to the thalamus to the cerebellum and back to the prefrontal cortex.  And recent research is showing the amygdala is implicated in ADHD more than we used to think, for older neuroimaging found it harder to image the very small and very deep area of the brain the amygdala is involved in yet this brain area then ties to the vast majority of the brain kind like how we use google to search the internet.","di6oi6q",3,1496067335,"2017-05-29 14:15:35"

 [**Hunter vs. farmer hypothesis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter%20vs.%20farmer%20hypothesis): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __hunter vs. farmer hypothesis__ states that [attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) (ADHD) in children and its counterpart in adults, the [adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder), have their origins in a tendency in those individuals for behaviors characteristic of [hunter-gatherer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer) societies over those of [farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farming) societies. The hypothesis was proposed by [Thom Hartmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Hartmann) and suggest that these conditions may be a result of a form of [adaptive behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior).

&gt;Hartmann developed the hunter vs. farmer idea as a [mental model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model) after his own son was disheartened following a diagnosis of ADHD, stating, ""It's not hard science, and was never intended to be.""  However, more recent molecular and clinical research has given support to the hunter vs. farmer hypothesis,  and some researchers  use the hunter vs. farmer idea as a working hypothesis of the origin of ADHD.

&gt;Hartmann notes that most or all humans were [nomadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad) [hunter-gatherers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer) for hundreds of thousands of years, but that this standard gradually changed as [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture) developed in most societies, and more people worldwide became [farmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer). Over many years, most humans adapted to farming cultures, but Hartmann speculates that people with ADHD retained some of the older hunter characteristics.

If this isn't something you are comfortable with, you have every right to refuse consent and not sign the paperwork.

"3250","To be honest, it doesn't even do that. For me, all medication does is alleviate some symptoms. I still fidget, forget, etc. Just makes it easier to drive without missing turns, and able to work without constantly finding myself zoned out.

If you want to explain to your parents how this makes sense on a chemical level, explain how people with ADHD have genes that make their brains constantly unaroused. Literally this means the brain is not maintaining normal levels of dopamine, so the person must seek out more dopamine than normal compared to other people. Thus, the medication allows us to alleviate that aspect of ADHD by keeping the levels of dopamine at a relatively normal level.

Take it easy man. I used to hate myself for taking medication also, thought I was taking the easy way out. I made it 20 years without it, got into a decent school etc. But I always knew I wasn't my full self. I actually hated myself deep down, and was probably going to commit suicide down the road no matter how people saw me. I couldn't justify taking medicine as there had been month stretches where I was productive, (I exercised, ate healthy, slept early regularly, which are ways to actually mitigate symptoms a little bit), only to fall out of it. I still believed I was lazy.

But the reality is, if medication helps you, it helps you. Tons of successful people used medication in school, or at work. People wane off of it sometimes if they don't need it. You might also. Just do what you have to do to improve.

"3290","For me it was the excessive daytime sleepiness. I had the sleep attacks too, but I was already being treated for ADHD and using one of the stimulants they use to treat Narcolepsy (methylphenidate). I was also having headaches when I woke up most mornings, something that I thought was because of caffeine withdrawals. I was dreaming when I had only been asleep for 10 minutes. A little thing called hypnagogic hallucinations were occurring as well.

I say all of this because it is possible to have both disorders. While OP could just be sleep deprived, there's reason to keep looking for the cause and find a solution. Like someone else said, sleep hygiene is a good place to start and essential for overall health. It's still something I try to improve on a daily basis.

"3310","The overall uncertainty of possible outcomes makes me flare up with anxiety.

To combat it near the ends of the semester/quarter - I find myself often sitting down for a few hours:(1) Tally up points given so far, show what I am looking at for the last assignments/final -(2) Use that to weigh what I can expect given past trends and confidence level -(3) Try to reason what that will take for me to put in additional effort into the final/last assignments to meet my target goal, my best case scenario, and my absolute minimums.It really helps to narrow down what is the anxiety versus realistic expectation:(4) If its a really tight fit to meet my target, I would review past assignments and justify grades - if something looks very harsh or unjustified, I would argue a regrade or review of the logic. (a lot of grading is more subjective than people want to admit, and not every teacher has a fair system, despite intentions)(5) - The important step: Write out a plan on what it would take to meet your target- time, practice, review. Draw out a schedule, write out blocks of time to focus on specific parts at a time. Give solid estimations and add a \* 1.2 time/effort modifier for each (an extra 20% effort).

This not only trims the anxiety of stuff that isnt real, but by sitting down and establishing a goal and a plan, you can use the real concerns as fuel to burn towards your success. Obviously we dont always succeed in our plans, but the likelihood of succeeding is drastically increased after doing this, and increases relative to how much effort you put into staying on track.

We may understand our falliability for planning, but that doesnt make it not an important step. Technically, that understanding should allow us to account for better planning. Include breaks, understand you wont be 100% focused at all times, add time to offset that. Give yourself constraints to limit external distractions. If social media is a problem, setup an environment where those accounts or even internet access is blocked for those blocks of time/ while you are in that environment. Dont bring your phone. etc etc.

I say this because I'm right there with you on this struggle: its constant, but theres always a better way to move forward. We just havta find those improvements on our day to day, keep improving, keep pushing. Someday we'll be done here and can breathe the air of relief.

Added: I found a major that avoided writing like the plague, but I love ideas, so I can rant like a madman. My solution to not knowing how to structure anything is to simply start with an outline format. I frame the key ideas, topic, intro, objectives first and then I fill in the blanks. Though I'm not a great writer, its done me good up until this point.  
imo: If you think heirarchically: use an outline format. else: try some kind of mind mapping/brainstorming to get the ideas out and work from top down.","eb3fzsd",1,1543959790,"2018-12-04 21:43:10"

- visual aids, incl. colors 
- when I read, I read out loud to myself or turn on a voice reader
- keep a pair of weights by my desk to lift when I need a free dopamine hit
- keep noise cancelling headphones on my desk because crinkling of a paper next door can drive me nuts\
- try to learn and practice mindfulness to keep my focus going (it's a process)
- caffeine, not too much, not too little. Black tea or diet coke work best for me. Coffee is too much, zero caffeine is too little.
- walk or run in the morning when I have the energy (not lately, but it typically works)
- make lists so i could check stuff off and feel happy about it. (task completion = dopamine hit)

"3363","Yeah my dad has/had a much more ignorant view of ADHD, and for a while I believed him. He thought I just had to work harder, also since my parents were divorced he hated picking my medication up when I was a kid because to him it was ""so hard"" having to make sure my meds were at his house and my moms house. But TBH its fucking disgusting how he makes the situation about himself when I'm the one struggling with ADHD not him. At least my mom was open minded about it and supported me whatever way she could. But my dad was always like this making things about him whenever I have trouble with something. Its pathetic.

However I guess I'm different then you in that regard since I don't mind telling people I have ADHD since often they wonder why I take a long time in things. ""Well there is your answer people"" I would think to myself, and if they have a problem with it. They are below me, shame on them for being ignorant. I have no problem changing their beliefs, since it will be better to fight the stigma and eventually they have a basic enough understanding so I put an end to the shit they would otherwise give me.","epoqvm9",1,1559350740,"2019-06-01 00:59:00"

That said, I had a similar situation to OPs where my psychiatrist disappeared with no communication, after months of showing up progressively late for appointments. My GP told me that psychiatrists outside of the hospital setting in my area rarely respond to her requests to refer patients (major shortage of docs) and I needed to start calling offices to find someone myself, at which point she would write the referral so I could book an appointment.

I am ALWAYS tired. Always always always always. Ever since middle school. I can sleep for 12 hours, be awake for 2 and go back to sleep. Hell, I can sleep for 24 hours straight. Trust me, I know it isn't normal. 

There are very few days a year that I wake up feeling I can get out of bed, without forcing myself, and go do shit and still have energy all day. It is a chore every day just to get out of bed on time and to make it through the day. Which is why I usually get fired from jobs, because I call in sick, because I just don't want to wake up and go to work. It's sad I would rather sleep my life away rather than live it. Even more sad, that when I'm awake, I'm exhausted wishing I was asleep. 

If I don't set an alarm, I will sleep until 2-3pm and wake up exhausted. I would kill to be a morning person and be all peppy with the energy of a Red Bull. That just isn't me. 

It may not be 100% ADHD but I do think it contributes to it. I'm hoping since I started medication it will help.

For what it's worth, I'm 45, and my life was this bizarre series of ups and rock bottoms until I found out I had ADHD at 40. The opportunity you have now is to now see how certain things in life did work for you, and some things don't. You can put a name to it, and can start building new structures for the way you live life to make it easier and smoother for yourself. Classic example...I got rid of the majority of my wardrobe to eliminate the struggle of choice. I have t-shirts that are all the same brand, that I love, and that's it. I don't have to choose anymore. That's just one example. 

As you navigate this diagnosis, try to be cool with yourself. There are way too many opportunities to beat ourselves up if we allow it. Let that be a baseline for you, even on days when nothing seems hopeful....just be ok with the fact that you aren't ok today.

I think the stigma against ADHD is everywhere but if you do end up failing it might be worthwhile to see what kind of accommodations you can get. If you've been doing really well otherwise and this one course is an outlier, maybe they will have some mercy on you.

Whatever happens good luck! And don't be too hard on yourself.

"3434","Good start. He may well be ADHD with or without some additional anxiety complicating the picture. The good news is you are getting help early, before he has messed anything up irretrievably. If he is, don't be afraid of meds. They can be life savers for some kids. Also, daily soccer or sports will help. One way to manage extreme energy is to find activities that can use that energy. Slightly off-topic: Maybe you should get him a math tutor or find him a tutoring center. The thing about 2nd grade (retired teacher here) is that he is forming his opinion of himself. His teachers and others are likely teaching him about grit, mindset and all the buzzwords but the critical piece here is you do not want him to decide he is stupid. That loss of self-confidence creates all sorts of future consequences including an excuse not to try harder challenges. My own ADHD kid has three degrees and is climbing the professional ladder fast. I think the key is to help your boy use the energy and believe in himself. I drove to endless soccer, gymnastics, tennis, softball etc. events. I recommend trying to notch down the electronics, too. Too much sedentary excitement can be really tough on ADHD kids because they don't know what to do later with the pent-up energy.","eh42i3w",1,1550941898,"2019-02-23 17:11:38"

"3462","First, a couple of things on how Adderall XR works. It has a special coating that only dissolves in high pH – this means it won’t dissolve in the stomach but will dissolve in the intestines; this is how they get the medication to be eXtended Release (XR). A side note about this that most prescribing physicians leave out: what you eat and when (i.e. before or after you take Adderall) matters. As you mentioned in your comment, you feel like you’ve “built an immunity to it”, which can sort of be true. Some folks report behavioral tolerance to amphetamines (the class of drug that Adderall belongs to), but Adderall does not induce the classic version of ‘tolerance’. Biologically, the body recognizes the molecule each day you take it as a new compound to be broken down. Apparently, it takes daily administrations three times of amphetamines to build tolerance, which very few physicians prescribe as a regimen for the medication.

As for your habits slowly sinking back in, the most I can encourage is persistence. The medication is a tool for behavioral changes. Personally, I take Vyvanse each day and it has helped tremendously, but not without lots of hard work on my part. I like to think of Vyvanse more like a honing rod I use for my kitchen knives; it’s a tool meant to keep the “knife” (which is me/my brain) sharp. The thing about a honing rod is I needed to learn how to use it properly in order to keep my knives sharp.

All that said, it’s definitely worth talking to your doctor about increasing the dose if you feel like it no longer works optimally. A word of caution, though: increasing doses increases the stimulation, euphoria, and overall “mood boost” you feel, while simultaneously increasing the off-target effects like heart rate/blood pressure, the potential for increased anxiety, and increased ability to go “tunnel vision” (hyper-focused and inability to deviate from the task).

Don’t think I’ll bother with gene testing, but thanks for the tip. Should probably be more standard when people struggle with meds. Docs seem to give up a little fast sometimes. 

More than that, but yes. I know I have high learning potential/IQ, whatever you wanna call it. And I know now that I could have had a well of opportunities if only someone saw me and gave me some help and guidance. And this partly leads to the next realisation, that my parents have been neglectful of us emotionally. Not their fault though, they have traumas of their own. And seeing this, how they pass their damaged emotions on to their children has hit me like a bus. I suddenly «see», not like supernatural seeing, just normal I guess.

"3517","As someone with ADHD I share the difficulty associated with starting a task until it is absolutely necessary and usually too late.

However, as a researcher who works in areas related to clinical depression from time to time, I can tell you that depression often diminishes a person's energy level for starting a task regardless of their ability to rationally desire to perform the task. So to many clinical psych people this kind of statement:

&gt; yet I can't seem to muster the energy to actually begin the task, even if it's something I know I have to do and have actual desire to finish.

sets off the ""it must be depression"" alarm. However, I am with you in that I don't think this is the correct or full diagnosis in many cases. I notice that even without any other typical symptoms of clinical depression, this single symptom remains in many with ADHD. Sometimes even when those with ADHD do have depression and are treated for it other symptoms of depression will subside, but the one you described remains. 

I know this comment doesn't offer any solutions, but hopefully adds a little more info as to why clinicians often jump to the depression label. ","d4r44au",2,1467117361,"2016-06-28 12:36:01"

* **Sustainable** -- One you can **maintain for a long time**, months, or even years.

* **Accountable** -- Involve a friend, SO, partner, family member, online community, etc.  **Avoid relying on willpower alone.**  Also, involving another person might be easier than trying to track every morsel, for someone with ADHD.

* **Flexible** -- **""Your fitness plan should revolve around YOU, not you revolving around the plan.""**  Aim for the 'middle of the road', i.e., progress without giving up all food, fun, and freedom.  You can't always control your life, but you can *forgive yourself* for getting off-track.  
Take note of the concept of ***'zig-zagging'*** or ***'cycling' calories***, and realize you **don't have to hit the same exact target every day.**  *Flexibility is KEY with ADHD.*

* **Efficient** -- **Figure out your Minimal Effective Dose (M.E.D.) of Exercise.** (This will keep your plan *sustainable*.)  ""[T]he most time any Average Joe or Jane needs to spend in the gym is 3-4 days a week for about 45-60 minutes.""  
Also, **[know your caloric requirement.](http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm)**  Don't attempt *extreme* caloric deficit, i.e., unless under a doctor's supervision, caloric goal for weight loss should never be under 8 Calories per *current* pound of body weight.

If an exercise is 'too easy', that is it doesn't require enough of your concentration, it doesn't seem to provide the mind-clearing 'active meditation' effects.  =)

I can also understand the other side of this as well... Imagine watching a loved one try to accomplish things over and over again, and more other than not, fail. While we know we have the skills and knowledge, those around us don't. They only see us say what we want to do. ADHD is after all a disorder of doing rather than knowing, right? We have trouble doing what we know how to do. 

This is definitely the thing that gets to me the most often. Right when I need the malt encouragement and support is when most people tend to turn to the ""it's ok, you tried...""

I worked an online grocery order job at a grocery store chain pre-pandemic. (rhymes with clicklist) When I started, we were told to aim for a minute per item. So a minute to walk to wherever the item was, grab it, scan it, bag it. By the time I left, about 8 months later, upper management had lowered that to 40 seconds, and decided that on top of that, if an item wasn't on the shelf we had to go in the backroom and check for it. The backroom was not organized at all. Every week, maybe 2 people out of 2 dozen would hit the time they wanted. I left bc I was moving, but probably would have left anyway considering they were talking about lowering the time metric to 30 seconds despite the fact that no one could meet the current metric consistently and they were doing nothing to help us do that.","gvqx1jg",2,1619296797,"2021-04-24 20:39:57"

My best advice is to take up some form of excercise combined with a change in attitude. My change was to say 'Yes' to everything that came my way (within reason), particularly at work.

"3616","It's called a ""neuropsychological evaluation"". I'm almost certain it's not standard, as I did things like IQ tests, reaction time tests, memory recall, etc. I got an ADHD diagnostic with a clinical psychologist, then got a second opinion from a psychiatrist (who prescribes my medication), and was suggested to go to a neuropsychologist for the long test. Very thorough, probably not standard since ADHD people don't usually want this much trouble. 

I was struggling after I transferred to my current school, which was reasonable since this school likes to torture students. Went to see the a school therapist to talk about depression - ADHD was never an option in the back of my head because I when I think of ADHD I though of the typical hyperactive, disobedient stereotype. After an hour with me, the school therapist was like ""Listen, this might sound strange, but I've been observing you this past hour and I think you should get tested for ADHD"". Me: *hahahaha you're funny, nah, I've always been top of my class until now and I'm a pretty good kid.* Her: ""Yeah but normal people don't play with things to be able to hold a conversation"". 

I'm under the insurance plan with the university, so I'm guessing they want to make sure I'm not abusing Adderall. They did pay for the 10-hour test and I only had to fork out $60 out of pocket (I think it costs something in the thousands otherwise)","cwjykgu",1,1446337079,"2015-11-01 00:17:59"

I also forget that a few hundred years ago I wouldn't have had any opportunities to write or make art or whatever. I would have had to work longer and harder hours and probably get accused of witchcraft because unmedicated me is an impulsive talker and I'd probably say something blasphemous, lol.

"3654","Possibly yes it can counter the sexual side effects, it did with me.  I had used wellbutrin by itself, with a SNRI, with strattera, and with vyvanse and concerta.  I been on many different ADHD meds as you can tell.

This is simplifying for I am trying to be concise.

Wellbutrin by itself made me happy, horny, and treated depression.  It made my sensory arrousal better where any good feeling just was more intense while not realky increading bad stimuli like fear or worry.  It had some positive cognitive effects but not as much as other meds.  You have no clue how horny I got on wellbutrin by itself and how it made sex better, more amazing, and how I thought I was on Viagra for sometimes I was so hard it practically hurt.

Vyvanse made me focus real well.  Too much vyvanse made me anxious, hurt working memory, but I was hyper focus but not in a good way.  I thought more with my emotional brain than my thinking brain.

My hornyness went down when we combined vyvanse with wellbutrin.  I was still as interested in sex like any male roughly similar to no meds but now I could focus and thus things would not trigger my male gaze and get me horny where now the horniness was a distraction like Wellbutrin.  Wellbutrin by itself helped focus in a non distracting environment but in some environments it caused distractions.  While my libido return roughly to normal with wellbutrin plus vyvanse when I did have sex it was more amazing than no meds at all but not as good as just wellbutrin.

Concerta plus wellbutrin does not help focus as much as vyvanse but it does not trigger anxiety, it helps focus overall but it is harder to hyperfocus when compared to vyvanse which is actually a good thing for it help me think both rationally and emotionally not one or the other.  Most of all it helps working memory which vyvanse did not help and at higher does actually made worse.

When on Concerta instead of being my shower self I am now a grower and look small when not arroused both with balls and shaft.  Yet when aroused I am harder than no meds at all and the sex is better than no meds at all but not as good as wellbutrin by itself.

All these drugs mess with similar neurotransmitters but how they mess with them at which rates and for how long can influence things liked blood flow and thus your junk.  Some people it causes vasodilation and some vasoconstriction, thus determine the default place your body sends blood like your brain, your muscles, or your junk.  Now sometimes with these meds given the right arousal stimuli your junk will perform, other times you can do everything but orgasm, and sometimes you have floppy junk.  Finding the right med, fine tuning the delivery determine how fast your body gets it, and fine tunning the dosage all matter for you may be fine in one situation but not the other.

I didn't even fully understand what it meant to have a learning disability then  so I was like oh yeah you're probably right. She made me feel sort of silly for bringing it up.

So sure, how you feel on caffeine may be somewhat similar to how you feel on some of the meds you’ll try. But if that’s the case, just talk to your psych about either lowering the dose or trying a new med. 
2.	Yes. Talk to your psychiatrist about possibly having ADHD and your interest in trying out stimulant medication.

They're not that sketchy but they will give you medication. Also, feel free to fudge how you say things to get what you want. I usually have to do that bc I'm already treated for depression (Lexapro) but if I talk about my life, doctors will freak out and try to get me on more or different ssris.

"3681","Same, was initially treated for depression, then rediagnosed ADHD.

After experimenting with medss over the last 2 years I am now currently taking Cipralex (anti-depressant/anti-anxiety) and dexedrine (short acting stim medication). They work well together. The cipralex alone makes me feel good, but drastically reduces motivation/increases apathy. But the dexedrine on top of it gives me the motivation/focus I need whilst having its anxiety side-effects mitigated by the cipralex. 

I don't think your situation is so uncommon. If the welbutrin doesn't work, or you're curious, I imagine it won't be a problem to try other medications in the future.

"3700","Hi Obfuscious, here is some advice I have picked up in the past couple months. As with everything else, take it with a grain of salt as this is my opinion and doesn't apply to everyone.


First off, some background on ADHD. ADHD is developmental disorder that deals with the [Executive functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions) of the brain and self-regulation. Dr. Barkley has a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyDliT0GZpE) on this topic. Additionally the [FAQ page](https://pay.reddit.com/r/ADHD/wiki/index) on the side has more info. Understanding ADHD better will help you understand what might be going on with individuals with it. That being said, my personal opinion is that 

&gt;those with ADHD need to be held to their actions. Don't be cruel about a mistake they made but their actions they are their own and a part of who they are. They still need to do their work on time but be forgiving when they mess up.


Those with ADHD tend to have difficulties with inhibition, distractions, working memory, emotional control, and more. These difficulties diminish with medication but never fully go away. Now some actual tips to assist in the relationship. Remember that everyone is not the same and some of these tips may or may not apply to your instance.

1. If you ever need a task completed or something done, **Be Concise** and to the point with the instruction. Distractions and working memory make it difficult to remember long instructions and motivation tends to go down when it seems like a long and daunting task. I read that some have had success by having the ADHD person repeat it after words.

2. Additionally **Write it down** or send it in a text/e-mail. This will be more lenient on their working memory. Often times I'll remember the task (like go to the) but forget the details (what is needed at the store).

3. If you have a date or important plans **Put it in a Calendar** and **create Alarms**. I use a phone calendar with alarms. This helps the working memory again but is really for the person with ADHD. If you guys become close then you might want to share a calendar. You may need to remind them about the dates and jaxxly made a great [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2wztph/the_right_way_to_remind_someone_with_adhd_to/) about this.

4. Motivation is often an issue, so **Reward them** when they do something correctly. I know that kinda sounds like pavlov's dogs but this classical conditioning can help. If they finish a project then give a back massage or a gift. If she needs a little bit of a boost then recommend going for some Ice cream after 20 minutes of work. 

5. **Verbal praise** can also do wonders and can help with self-esteem issues.

6. It seems like a person with ADHD is constantly apologizing for breaking, losing, and forgetting stuff so you will need to **Be Forgiving**. Anxiety can be an issue and this will help relieve some of the stress they might feel.

7. To add to that, frustration and anger can often be misplaced. If they lash out then **Be Understanding**. This tends to be the most difficult part especially for a relationship as you may actual be hurt by something said and become angry yourself. So try not to escalate the anger into a fight.

8. After the situation has calmed down **Have A Conversation**. It is important to have open and honest conversation so that both sides can air issues that they might have. This talk needs to happen relatively soon to the event (within a day) so that neither side is holding a grudge. 


Some of these tips are from personal expierence and others from reading/watching. My SO does a few of these tips for me and we have been together for ~5 years now. If anything is wrong with my info please let me know.


**TL;DR**

* Research more about ADHD

* Keep accountability

* Be concise with instructions

* Write info down (text, e-mail, stick notes)

* Use calendars and alarms

* Give verbal praise and rewards/gifts

* Be forgiving and understanding

* Have open and honest conversations","cox09s1",6,1424894329,"2015-02-25 19:58:49"

You can do it! Hang in there, you gave it your best and you have a family that loves you to help you, I am sure they will understand!

That helped me rewriting other people's notes etc.","dhrgyte",1,1495193785,"2017-05-19 11:36:25"
"3703","As far as having meditation itself down, I still need a lot of practice. I do notice though that when I make the commitment to do it - which is usually when my anxiety is starting to make my brain jump all over the place - I already feel a bit more relaxed, even if I haven't started meditating yet. My anxiety just feels so out of control sometimes, and even making the conscious decision to stop what I'm doing and meditate for a few minutes gives me at least somewhat of a renewed sense of control even before I've actually started meditating. 

EDIT: Missed your second question ...

A quiet place is usually best for me (so my room, my living room if my roommate isn't home, my office if my office mates aren't there, etc.), and eyes closed 99% of the time. 

My actual posture varies depending and just depends on what I feel like doing. Sometimes I sit crossed-legged with my hands clasped in my lap. I generally don't like to keep my hands on my knees because I don't feel I can relax and stretch my shoulders out enough - it's just uncomfortable to me. If I'm home I will sometimes lie on my back with my knees bent to each side and feet together. I have very tight hips from years of being a softball catcher/other sports/lifting, so this helps to open them. I don't always focus as well on the breath when I do this since I can feel the tightness in my hips sometimes, but when that happens I focus on my hips relaxing and ever so slowly getting closer to the ground, which allows them to open up. I also rest my neck on my foam roller sometimes when I am on my back as well. Sitting or laying on the floor/ground makes me feel more 'grounded' than sitting in a chair does. I used to use an app that said to focus on the sensations of the ground or whatever you're sitting on beneath you, and I just feel less like myself and my brain are floating off into space when I can become one with the ground. Again, the idea is to let thoughts come in and out and not pass judgement on them, but sometimes I do think, ""The earth may be spinning, but I'm right here. Here I am.""

Sometimes I meditate outside on my balcony or outside my office on campus when it's a nice day out. While noise can serve as a distraction, I think of doing this as a training tool for me to work on letting outside sounds just come and go just as my thoughts should. 

Give the posture in that image a go and if it's works for you, great! If it doesn't, just adjust to whatever is comfortable - there isn't a right or wrong. I personally wouldn't sit like that, at least for long, because I have bad knees also due to softball, but that's just me.

EDIT: One more thing to add:

Some don't advocate listening to music, which I understand because it can serve as a distraction. There is one song I do listen to sometimes when I meditate though because the first time I heard it was during savasana at the end of a yoga practice and it just made me feel something different than I had ever experienced before during savasana. I don't know what it is about this song, but I love it, and listen to it when I just need a feel-good song. I think a lot of it is the rhythm of it near the end. It has words so may not work for everyone, but thought I would throw it out there ...

This is actually one of the arguments the doctors used to use AGAINST medicating kids without super-severe behavior problems when I was young.

The studies that have shown the best effect are the ones where the kid is put on meds TEMPORARILY while getting behavior and study skills training. So the meds basically give the kid a chance to learn the EF skills he needs.  But without the skills training, the meds are worthless.

And too many parents see the drugs as a cure-all, and DON'T get their kids the other help they need. 

It takes a lot longer to teach an ADHD kid scheduling, organization, and emotional control. BUT if you're willing to take the time, it's a lot better in the long run.

An example that pertains to me is working with my horse. It forces me to pay attention to what I'm thinking and feeling because she is sensitive enough to pick up on that. If I'm anxious and stressed, she will be as well. If I'm not constantly mindful of whatever I'm doing, I can get hurt and my horse could too.

So physical and mental stimulation. Hands-on things. Another example for me is playing violin. It's mentally a lot of work and physically too because I have to hold the bow just right or I fuck up and I have to listen to what notes I'm playing and my finger placement. 

It's important to remember that these methods only go so far though since we are prone to frustration and ""rage quit"" as I like to call it. That's something I haven't figured out how to work with yet. ","dv10fk5",2,1519928936,"2018-03-01 18:28:56"

Might be tempting to up the dose yourself but it's not really an instant feeling drug as far as I can tell, like the way adderall sounds. One day at the correct dosage it'll just feel right. You'll notice a difference in your concentration, like it drowns out the background noise that usually keeps you from focusing on the task in front of you. If you have problems with impulsiveness it helps control those things too.

If you have sufficient coverage with your plan, get the name brand Concerta. Generic brand is made by several different companies  who don't make the extended-release technology as perfect as the name brand does. 

Talk to your pharmacist about a free Innovi Cares card. I believe Concerta pays the difference between generic brand and their brand, but you get the better quality drug.","cxdpwby",1,1448549025,"2015-11-26 14:43:45"

But I wasn’t going to get rid of my tv because come on now, so instead I decided to move my couch out of my living room and into my office where my bookcases are. And in doing so, I loved my home workout equipment into my living room. So now, I associate my couch with reading and/or working, since it’s in my office, and inevitably I associate watching tv with working out or—get this—actually watching tv! I realized that by having couch in the living room, I had somehow taught myself to sit on the couch with my phone or my laptop while the tv was on in the background and I never actually watched anything new on tv. Even tho I pay for like every channel and streaming service. I’d just rewatch stuff I’d already seen. What a waste. Now I read more, workout more, and watch new shows &amp; movies. I can sleep when I’m dead! Jk jk, in conclusion, associations are great.","fwjucvt",1,1593576583,"2020-07-01 04:09:43"

Do you think you are more or less likely to get the job if you tell the employer that you have ADHD, which make you forgetful, late, unfocused, inattentive, hyper, and impulsive?

Do not tell them.  Work as hard as you can for the first 4 months - you are being evaluated everyday on every project.  Become of great value to the company.

So far our knowledge is that stimulants do not ""fix ADHD"" once you go off the medicine you revert to the similar level of ADHD symptoms prior to the medicine.

We know that this also applies to Atomoxetine / Strattera as well.  That said there is some evidence that a small minority actually do better than their pre-med self with ADHD symptoms when they discontinue atomoxetine, but nowhere near as effective as their ADHD symptoms while medicated.  *Why this happens is open up to speculation and the topic deserves more study before someone makes guesses on why this occurs.*","d610s6r",1,1470147277,"2016-08-02 14:14:37"
"3751","Last post.

I appologize if I gave you too much info, but I figure too much is always better for you can always decide I am done and do not need anymore :)

Remember you can always **try** medicine and see if your daughter responds positively or not positively.  We know from hundreds of studies (literally hundreds) that the ADHD meds are safe in children and even young children such as a 5 year old.  The big deal is that ADHD meds have side effects and thus not all kids benefit positively from meds.  Through trial and error you can usually find a proper med for 9/10 kids that brings more positive than negative.

The biggest thing I would worry is about emotional side effects.  These can be avoided by starting the dose very low and seeing how she responds and if its not well you stop the med or you go back to a lower dose.  Young ADHD kids benefit from meds just as much as older kids and adults the big deal is they are not as good as communicating as 5th graders let alone a doctor about how this med makes me feel different.  Almost always the improvement is better but the problem is not always the med is better.  Anger, Anxiety, or Irritability are some things that may cause you to switch from one med to the other.

I personally recommend trying Intuniv (Guanfacine XR) for with me that has been a great med.  Vyvanse by itself caused me anxiety, but Vyvanse plus Intuniv (or you can use Intuniv by itself) worked wonderfully.  Intuniv besides being an ADHD med is a blood pressure medicine and an anti-anxiety medicine.  It helps you calm down, think, and relax.  Intuniv helps with emotional control while still keeping wonderful emotions.  Sometimes Intuniv is specifically given to kids who get into fights where they just explode into conflict where something that would annoy another kid suddenly becomes a fist fight for they did not self calm and **just reacted.**.  It is also far less likely to decrease appetite compared to the stimulants.

One nice thing about having a young child is she does not have responsibilities.  The stimulants help better with the attention and the impulsivity issues.  Intuniv does not do as much with the attention issues (it does help), but it does great with the impulsivity, emotional control, and working memory and has less side effects than stimulants.  So you may want to try that med first (though the stimulants are great and they have been studied to death.)","cmwdi3k",1,1418715257,"2014-12-16 07:34:17"

"3755","I have several rules of thumb for recognizing problematic decision-making that I’ve learned over the years. Two that seem relevant to your situation:

* “Try harder” is not a sustainable solution to anything. Focus and willpower are both limited resources, and trying harder to do something that isn’t working increases the spend rate.
* Descriptions of work or suggestions that include the word “just” should always be regarded with suspicion: it is very likely that there are complicating factors that aren’t being considered.

I’m sorry that your husband hasn’t been as understanding and encouraging as you’d hoped. There are a lot of good content-creators out there who have made a lot of good works that explain and illustrate the experience of having ADHD. Perhaps you could send your husband to some of those as a place to start a more productive discussion? I’m a big fan of both the How to ADHD YouTube channel and Dani Donovan’s ADHD comic series.

I wasn't technically failing (3.3 GPA), but I did have a nervous breakdown during my first attempt at undergrad, and it was in music performance, and I was clearly not going to make it as a performer. It was only after that that I was diagnosed. I made one attempt at medication back then, but I think the dose was too high, and I got scared off of it--I had the ""zombie"" effect.

I didn't get any more treatment until a year after forcing my way through my 2nd attempt at my bachelor's, and getting a master's on the 1st try. I got treatment because my marriage was in real trouble, because I didn't realize how little I paid attention to my husband. 

I'd had symptoms through childhood, and whenever there was a big project that I barely finished on time, or a teacher made a special exception to let me turn it in late. So no one thought it was a problem that required treatment until they saw things they couldn't explain away as ""laziness"" or ""poor discipline.""

"3785","I used to think I was an extrovert until I realised how taxing and overwhelming responding to people gets, especially when other things are wearing on my tolerance (like sensory overload).

I am very sociable and I suffer without social connections, but I am also drained by extended social interactions. I pay a price to fill that social need. I also pay a price to get groceries or live in a house, but obviously I need food and shelter, so I view it like that. Time alone or with my wife, just chilling, petting my cats, reading - that’s my “income” for social interaction, just like income from having a job and then paying bills.

I’m just making up this analogy and realising that extroverts - like, think the stereotype of it, those who are loud and taxing and don’t understand how anyone doesn’t want to go out all the time or be doing something with other people constantly - don’t “get” it because they don’t have to “work” for social “income”.. being with people energises them. Socialising is its own reward. It’s like being rich but still getting an unconditional automatic income: they don’t realise how hard other people have to work to “pay for” a social interaction that PAYS THEM just by having had the interaction at all.

Tangent, but yeah, I also feel uneasy when I haven’t had connection with friends and family. I feel lonely/isolated. Not being able to go to church, a calm and familiar environment for face-to-face interaction, has been rough for me.

"3796","I just spent 2 years thinking the same about myself because I couldn't get to finish one book. Them I took a different one, thin, and finished it in one sitting. :)

Here's my advice:

1. Ditch the ""all or nothing"" thinking, it's a bad pattern that CBT points out. It's not never, it's not with every book, you NEVER have to read the entire book, it depends on the mood, etc etc. Sure, we have it harder, but we can read books and get pleasure from it. :)

2. Blame the book, not yourself. I know it sounds like not wanting to take responsibility. :) And society will cringe at ""Shakespeare is unreadable"". But I feel liberated when I say to myself ""nah, this book isn't working for me, bye"" instead of ""I can't get through this book, stupid broken me"".

3. In the spirit that not all books were written equal, books for ADHDers are usually well-written for us, so they deserve a chance.

4. As an e-book person, I like's Amazon's ""send a sample"" functionality, which lets your start a book (it's usually the first chapter), no strings attached, and you can buy it if you want to read more. You can do something similar with allocating your time: the first chapter gets a chance, but the full book will be decided upon later.

It was a paragraph from a Wikipedia article about grey wolves, and as I read through it, I marked every word where I was distracted by a thought with a white marker tool on my laptop's photo editor. So if a sentence read ""Population numbers have dwindled from 1,000 to just 300 in the past ten years"", I would block out everything starting with the word ""dwindled"", because it made me remember a line from a book that used the same word. While I might have continued reading about wolves, my mind had gone elsewhere and all the content from that sentence wasn't being absorbed.
Doing this cut out loads of important pieces of information, which I felt was pretty indicative of what it's like trying to read with untreated ADHD - at least, in my experience.

I really like the way I feel on the XR, but I need a slightly higher dose for it to be as effective as the regular stuff. I had some inconvenient side effects from the regular that are nonexistent with the XR. unfortunately, I have found that the XR does not last the entire day, thus the evening regular dose.

 * Do note that Ritalin LA is jumpy, but Concerta, Metadate CD, and Ritalin SR are much  more even.  Also note with concerta the initial effects of the drug is the same rate as the other drugs (this is due to Concerta having an inital release coating) but then a much more gradual slope to the hill which leads to less side effects in some people followed by a tapering off.  Now some people prefer Metadate and SR effects over Concerta.

A big part of ADHD is desperately wanting to do something but you just can't make yourself do it. So try not to beat yourself up too much about that. Rather than get upset at yourself, or see that as evidence of failure, or internalize something negative your wife might say, realize that it is a symptom of what you're struggling with.


I get it. If there's one thing I've learned in life, it's that the world only cares about results, it doesn't care what extenuating circumstances prevented something from getting done. It's frustrating to see opportunities slip away, or to face legal challenges as a result of a disorganized mind.

The way I try to look at it is this: I know ADHD causes me unique challenges that other people see as laziness or non-issues. But I can't compare myself to them, because that only leads to misery. Instead, I try to brainstorm and read up on coping mechanisms, and experiment to find what does actually work for me. 


A practical example: I used to get shut off notices for late payment nearly every month for my bills. Not because I couldn't afford it, but because I simply couldn't keep track of when they were due. I ended up going online and enrolling in email bills, and my personal policy is when I get an email notification that a bill is ready, I drop everything, *and I mean everything*, and login and pay it right then. That may not work for other people, and it's a bit on the neurotic side, but I haven't gotten a cutoff notice in years. So I challenge you to pick something - maybe the license violation - and brainstorm what actions you can take to prevent it from happening again. Does your state have a renewal notice you can sign up for? Can you set calendar reminders for 2 months, 1 month, 3/2/1 weeks before expiration?


As far as your wife goes, I really hope she can come to terms with your situation. If you get the chance, you might look into talking to a therapist on your own, to help you deal with your feelings about your situation, and tools to help you and your wife work through this.","ghkyh6j",1,1609394030,"2020-12-31 05:53:50"
"3850","I used to get this too!

For me I needed to: 

• look over my dosages (i was on vyanse and escitalopran/lexapro)

• look over the way I have sex - for an example, I need to communicate to whoever I’m having sex with that after I come, it’s over, doesn’t matter if they came or not. Some men take some time to get used to this and seem to get big mad but calmly explaining that well it’s that or us having sex when I don’t actually want to. Which is not sex. 

• Idk why this helped but the problem has decreased significantly since I cut back on, and now pretty much completely stopped, watching porn. 

I tried to research this a bit and if I understand it correctly then what happens in the brain when anticipating a large influx of any brain chemical is that it “makes space” for that one. 
So it might clear out more of it, or wait with releasing it until the anticipated event
- this apparently is the same for smoking or drinking; 
if you always have a glass of wine when you come home, then in order to maintain equilibrium, the brain will release less opioids, less gaba, and whatever else alcohol makes. 

The result of this is that if you don’t get your hit/don’t have alcohol, you’ll be much more irritable in a situation with anticipatory cues than you would be in an unfamiliar situation - even though your chemical dependence is the same. 

And so since porn is not actual physical stimulation, porn really is anticipation. 

I’m not saying like everyone should stop watching it forever or like nofap or anything like that, I’m not a puritan at all - but what I am saying is that if you watch it, it could play a part in the irritability - and if you watch it it might be worth challenging yourself not to, and to instead read erotic novels or browse forums where people post selfies etc 

(I didn’t just like transform right away, I started with like most of the time trying without porn, and if it didn’t work I might watch a video but I delayed it so that it wasn’t a prerequisite to masturbation but rather something I’d use as spice to it. And then after a while I tried to see if there were alternatives that would work. 

So now I tend to look at the nsfw forums on here - sure it’s sexual content but it’s not as staged and it’s not as passive as consuming porn is; it still requires more engagement from me, more imagination etc. 
It’s like, there are spaces in between reading posts or seeing photos in which my own sexuality grows and thrives. 

And now I don’t even always use that. 




Doing so has made sex less of like an increase towards a climax that hits like a shock, and more of an activity that slowly releases dopamine continuously throughout - which doesn’t cause the same crash for me","f0yl8yw",1,1569072657,"2019-09-21 13:30:57"

"3852","""cheer up"" has to be one of the most rage-inducing ""positive"" thing you can say to someone. I feel like everyone here has had that same type of ignorant, half-assed ""caring"" given to them growing up. ADHD isn't something a non-ADHD person can accurately simulate. So there's an empathy gap there that can't really be bridged. It's also a ""trendy"" disorder that's often misappropriated to explain regular human behavior. When you treat a legitimate disorder as a social/learning qualifier, non-afflicted people won't take it seriously. Austism probably has that same reaction in people. Although, I'd say because of the debilitating levels of autism as compared to those with ADHD, those who aren't as (for lack of a better word) afflicted by it, it's easier to dismiss their real issues.
 
We just put up with a lot of ignorance about things that directly affected us as individuals, so we don't give it back to each other because we know what each other is going through.

"3859","I'm very sorry to hear you are struggling with post-partum depression so long. Have you been able to get medication to help?

I am a textbook hyperfocuser in general and have had many depressions throughout life prior to my adhd-diagnosis/meds. Depression naturally makes me want to isolate. I don't want anyone bothering me or stimulating me in any way. Hyperfocusing is kind of like isolating if you think about it. It blocks out everything else. I find it very comforting to be in hyperfocus mode. What types of things do you hyperfocus about in particular? Is it more gloom and doom stuff or an actual task/activity you are interested in? 

I find that when I am over-stressed and too much is going on i get irritable and frustrated. I just want to get into my hyperfocus on something interesting to me and be left alone. I think that with my ADHD I hit a mental saturation point much earlier than the norm and actually hyperfocus as a coping mechanism because it is so easy for my brain to hyperfocus. Has having a child made you feel overwhelmed and that you need to isolate? I can only imagine it would for me, which is why I didn't have children, which is a shame.

"3867","From what I understand about ADHD, it's a condition where ambient endogenous dopamine is too low. This low level causes us to fidget, look around, switch topics, act out, interrupt etc. These kind of behaviors give us little squirts of dopamine and we are able to pay attention until we need another ""dose."" Amphétamines are dopamine agonists which flood the brain with dopamine and it allows us to focus and complete tasks without having to engage in the aforementioned behavior. 

The medical science behind stimulant meds is sound but the application of said science sucks. The medications aren't effective in the long term. The body needs more and more of the drug to just function at a baseline. Moreover having all this dopamine in the brain for too long can cause psychosis, memory loss and other negative side effects.  Likewise the medical science behind pain control with opiates is sound too but it can end up leading to addiction and often use of street drugs when one is ""cut off.""

When I was on stims I always felt like there needs to be a better drug to treat my condition. When they cut me off, I was eventually put on Wellbutrin which is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, not an agonist. It's related to amphétamines but doesn't have the activation effect stims do. In other words if I'm on Wellbutrin all my endogenous dopamine stays around longer and I am able to focus and pay attention. It's a much better drug for me. Doesn't have the motivating effect of stims, but also doesn't have me chasing my tail like some tweaker. It took a long time for my brain to stop hoping the Wellbutrin was going to give me the activating effects of adderall, eventually acceptance kicked in. 

When I was in your situation, I went to 12 step meetings, raised my hand, took their advice and I was able to get and stay off the agonists. It's been 3.5 years. After 5 months at the start, the docs put me on the Wellbutrin and it's worked wonderfully.

"3878","I've experienced bupropion and alcohol at the same time before. It was awful.

Actually, the effects of just plain bupropion by itself were also pretty bad for me - I felt shittier in general, and I started to experience sleep paralysis most nights - which, if you don't know, is absolutely terrifying.

I asked my doctor if sleep paralysis was a known side effect, and he said 'no.' I haven't heard of anyone else experiencing this, so maybe I'm a rare case. But I'm 100% positive it was the bupropion, having experienced sleep paralysis only twice before in my life.

But anyway, back to the alcohol. I had some once at the end of the day to relax... bad idea. It took everything horrible about the drug and amplified it. It was hard to get to sleep that night because I would wake up from adrenaline due to the sleep paralysis, and in the morning I felt absolutely awful. Groggy, weak, unable to stand, headache... it was awful. I stopped taking the pills after that, which definitely improved things, though it took a few months before the sleep paralysis wore off. Bleh. Actually, I still experience it every now and then. That was several years ago, and I still get it about every 8 months or so. But that's not so bad.

Anyway, this is just my experience with combining those two drugs. NEVER AGAIN. Bad idea. But if you'd like some better quality information, I think https://www.erowid.org/search.php?q=bupropion might be useful.

I should probably tell you that it's best to talk to your doctor... but mine didn't know jack shit about the possibility of sleep paralysis. So don't think they know everything just because they're supposed to...

I work nights and my employer has a gym on site that I use. I work out about 20-30 minutes twice over the course over a 12 hour shift. My breaks are always at 8:30pm and 1:30am.

I've been able to keep this habit up regularly since May and I have gone from 185lbs to 166lbs (slowly, and consistently). 

And because I have limited the amount of time I can workout to these small chunks, I don't risk overdoing it and hurting myself. I had a really bad habit of going ham on myself and having to stop due to injury.

I also managed to change up my diet as well. That wasn't really a big change in effort though.

Write everything down. Use a paper calendar and write everything on it. Cross out the days and tasks as you complete them. Keep it hanging where you can't miss it. 

Meditate. This is the single biggest thing you can do to help build your focus and calmness over time, IMHO. I use Playne on my PC but there are a zillion meditation apps you can use. Practise it! 

Tell people in your life about how you're struggling. Let them know what things you find difficult and what you tend to neglect. If they care then they can help to remind you, to check in with you; this is crucial to prevent you from getting buried in things that are left undone or forgotten.

&amp;nbsp;

Keep on trying different medicines.  Sometimes the stimulants help dyslexia alot, they are usually the most effective medicines for dyslexics, but in some people a smaller group Strattera works loads better.  If you are a person who also has a math disorder you are at a higher increase at Strattera working vs Stimulants.  Now there are some other correlations with other specific symptoms like confusion of right and left on an automatic level (not using your eyes, or not mentally visualizing things) but the correlation of whether Strattera or Stimulants work better is less with that, math disorder do you have seems to be the best predictive factor.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

So make sure you try

* Stimulants of the Amphetamine class like Vyvanse and Adderall (you are currently using this class, and while it treats the highest percent of people, sometimes the other meds work better)

 * Follow up question, how did you arrive at that dosage of Adderall 15 MG XR and 2.5 MG IR.  While 20 or so mgs of adderall per day treats many ADHD people sometimes you need a higher dose, the maximun dose that many doctors consider before trying another medicine is 40mg of Adderall per day.  Adderall XR a single pill goes up to 30 mgs, with the rest being IR, or you using 2 20mgs pills one in the morning and one 4 to 6 hours later.

 * Note that other forms of amphetamine are also good meds but the mgs may be different due to not the amphetamine part but due to the base part being used in the calculation of that mg dose, and whether there is lysine bonded to that molecule.  So comparing different types of amphetamine and whether its an amphetamien salt or amphetamine just the base changes mgs amount.

-----

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* Try the methyphendiate meds like Concerta, Ritalin, etc.  They are an ADHD stimulant but a different class of stimulant

 * These meds affect the same brain areas as the amphetamines but they do not modify the dopamine and norepinephrine system in the same way.

 * Thus some people respond better to these meds than amphetamines in both total treatment of ADHD but also side effects.  2/3rds of ADHD people do well on Amphetamines, 2/3rds of ADHD people do well on Methylphenidate, about 80% when you try both classes of meds respond well to at least 1 of those 2 classes and some people respond well to both.

-----

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* Try Strattera, Strattera does different things in the frontal striatal system than stimulants, while messing with this is often good with dyslexia sometimes it hurts.  Also Strattera does different things in the anterior (aka the closer to your forehead) part of the frontal parietal part of the attention system and different things in the posterior part of the frontal parietal system (aka closer to the back of your head).  This is due to while stimulants and strattera are both reuptake inhibitors, too much dopamine in certain brain areas actually cause you to use more of the close to the forehead part of the attention system instead of the back of the attention system.  People with dyslexia and ADHD actually usually have more problems with passing data back and forth between these two systems.  Sometimes stimulants help this be better at passing data back and forth, but in some people too much dopamine in certain brain areas can be counterproductive.  It causes you to get in a ""stuck thought loop"" aka think OCD for this is part of what is occurring with OCD, but another half a dozen things are going wrong with OCD.

 * Strattera works with norepinephrine in the same brain areas that the stimulants do, Strattera does affect dopamine but only on the place labeled mesocortical in this picture.

 * [Picture](http://images.slideplayer.com.br/11/3194726/slides/slide_21.jpg)

 * Stimulants by contrast increase dopamine in all 3 places and sometimes this is a good thing and sometimes this is a bad thing.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* There is another ADHD medication that you can use in conjunction with the stimulants and it often helps with lots of the symptoms of ADHD and some of the symptoms of Dyslexia but not all.  The medicine called Intuniv is a type of medicine called Alpha 2 agonist.  It can help with the working memory of adhd, the able to keep things in your mind longer, the emotional control, the lowering of impulsivity, the hyperactivity etc.  So if you find one stimulant that works for you and you want to stay on stimulants, try adding this 2nd medicine to your stimulant for its

 * A) Safe to do so

 * B) It was specifically tested in FDA studies as a medicine by itself and a medicine used in conjunction with stimulants

 * C) In most people using this med together with a stimulant works better than just using a stimulant.

 * D) This medicine removes some of the stimulant downsides.  It does so by causing better regulation of your brains norepinephrine, and your brain's adrenaline.","d4g0g4r",1,1466384434,"2016-06-20 01:00:34"

"3914","The two types of stimulants do the exact same thing to your brain, they are just metabolised differently in the body, and people may have different reactions to the medications. There is no “superior” medication, since everyone’s experiences vary and it’s really just a case of trial and error to find what works for you.

Personally, Ritalin/Concerta (which is methylphenidate) gave me horrible anxiety, but I’m currently doing really well on Vyvanse (which is lisdexamphetamine). However, my brother had the exact opposite experience, so there’s really no way to tell if/how they might affect you differently. 

As for the names, methylphenidate is usually prescribed as Ritalin (short-acting) or Concerta (long-acting). Dexamphetamine is usually prescribed as Adderall (short-acting) or Vyvanse/Elevanse (long-acting). The one you are prescribed will differ depending on what fits best with your schedule, for example schoolchildren are usually prescribed the long-acting versions so they can last through the school day. 

There are also non-stimulant medications such as guanfacine and bupropion. These are usually taken in conjunction with a stimulant medication to increase its effectiveness, but in the case that an individual can’t take stimulants for whatever reason, they can also be taken by themselves. 

The stimulant medications generally are more successful but again it’s impossible to tell what will work best for you until you test your options. I hope that helps!","ey7gfj4",1,1566882284,"2019-08-27 05:04:44"

It’s unfortunate that doctors don’t listen to the pleas of their patients. Health professionals should not dismiss what a patient is telling them because everyone’s experience with symptoms will play out in a different ways. In the case above, doubting a patient is thinking that their symptoms are related to a different issue but recognizing that are actually feeling it, dismissing is thinking the issue doesn’t exist at all.

I flunked almost everything in high school, including subjects I liked. I pulled it together enough to finish (with the help of an extra year) and finally started to work out how to learn and begin to succeed when I was 20 or 21. To this day I’m not sure how to do well in high school, I’m just glad I don’t have to figure it out now.

All that failure didn’t stop me from going on and getting multiple degrees (including a graduate degree in a subject I failed in high school, from an Ivy League school) and a great career.

High school success or failure isn’t a sign of anything.

It’s incredibly frustrating and incredibly hard, but all that’s happening is that you haven’t figured out how you learn yet, so you’re not performing as well as you can. Our learning doesn’t work like other people’s, so they show us how to do things the “right” or “normal” way and we fail. That doesn’t mean we can’t do the thing, it’s just that we have to learn it differently, look at it differently, and do it differently. You know the zinger from Ginger Rogers doing everything Fred Astaire did, but backwards and in heels? That’s us.

You have the drive, that’s clear. Therefore, you will figure this out, I know you will. And you’ll soar. Don’t give up yet.

"3927","TL;DR: Been on Adderall, Vyvanse and Strattera. Strattera is the lesser evil of the 3.

Strattera was better until I had to titrate my dose up. Then I kept waking up at night. It can cause over-sensitive bladder, which is at least what I noticed when it woke me up. I was pretty awake though too, so not sure what was the chicken or the egg? Maybe I woke up and just happened to notice I had to pee too. But I'm ridiculously sensitive to medications, usually baby doses are effective, if there's a chance of GI upset or agitation, it happens. Vyvanse made me agitated nearly out of mind. Adderall was great for years, but it started giving me bad GERD, probably had been all along, just took awhile to bother me really bad. Also started getting agitation with it. With that one, I'm a bit inclined to think the quality of the generics was a factor as well. Hope this info helps you some. I'm still on a baby dose of strattera. It's better than nothing. I supplement it with caffeine and white-knuckled willpower. Or I just fail. Depends on the day. Umph, not sure this info is helpful????

I can go over the tasks I set last midnight and see if I managed the last half of my 'yesterday' and the first half of my 'today' alright. Then I set up the last half of my 'today' and the first half of my 'tomorrow'.

So instead of being overwhelmed by trying to jot down every little thing I might need to remember (but probably don't need to at all) I just organize the big picture of my day and assess how I did yesterday.

My layout, in case you'd like to set up something similar:

Today I'm grateful for: (What has happened since I last filled this out that I really appreciate?)

Health/wellness task: (What will I do for my own health today?)

Fun task: (How will I make sure I have some fun rather than just focusing on work today?)

Most important task: (What absolutely needs to be done today? What subtasks can I break this into, and how long do I think they'll take?)

Other tasks: (What else would I like to do today if I can? How important are they? How long might they take?)

"3950","Links to and mentions of ADDitude are not allowed on /r/adhd because we feel they have demonstrated themselves to be untrustworthy and that they, despite soliciting donations from people with ADHD to fund their operation, prioritize profit and advertising dollars over our best interests. Their website is full of articles promoting the use of homeopathy, reiki, and other unscientific quack practices. They also have had articles for Vayarin (a medical food that is now no longer sold in the US because its research was bunk) that suspiciously looked like stealth advertisements (which is highly unethical and illegal in the US).

We also find it problematic that their medical review panel includes not only legitimate doctors and psychologists, but also (at the time of writing) one practitioner of integrative medicine, which combines legit medical practice with pseudoscience and alternative medicine. They have previously had other quacks on the panel as well.

"3962","Tools tools and more tools. Before diagnoses and medication I was fucking up majorly. I'm in a unique position where I regularly meet with the CEO, CTO, and CIO along with several directors. It's a NYC white shoe firm that is ultra by-the-book and the people here are very extremely literal and because of the specific industry we are in **words mean things**. 

I'm constantly creating designs that will be seen by the above named *very important people*. Before meds I would often send out documents that were 95% to 99% correct but I would always be dinged for missing words or casual and really very dumb mistakes. It also does not help that the programs I constantly use do not include a native spell check. 

What I have done post meds is get better at delivering work so I'm not as rushed and I'm able to take my time to correct silly mistakes (they still happen but now I have time to catch things).  I also have several tools at hand to check my work including a buddy system with my direct manager where he checks over work before it goes up the flag to the big names. Set up is also helpful, although it takes time I have started to write out my projects in statement of work like documents that are then sent out **before** work begins so that I'm not going down hours long reddit holes while I freak out about my work. 

During revisions I *try* to track changes by constantly writing stuff out. (i.e. ""changes introduced in version 5.0"")

I am also thinking about using a git like system to track changes through a project. 

Versioning has been a life saver. I version everything and I double and triple back everything up. Whenever I begin the day and start work on an ongoing document I immediately save up a version. Because of versioning, tracking changes and saving everything I am now able to go back and figure out where I went wrong or where a mistake was introduced. Often I am find the mistakes are not always my fault and, if I am able to clearly draw out the history of documents I find that trust is being built again. 

I see that you don't want to take meds but I might suggest revisiting the topic and maybe trying something else, stims are not the only game in town and they are but a small (yet crucial) piece of the puzzle. ","e93zehz",3,1541443601,"2018-11-05 18:46:41"

"3966","Of course, the last thing I want to do on a subreddit for ADHD support is to imply to someone that they don't have ADHD, but you should remember that ADHD is a disorder that includes many, many symptoms and has specific criteria that need to be met for a legitimate diagnosis.

Inattention itself and alone does not mean by any stretch that you have ADHD. Yes, attention issues are a significant portion of the struggles ADHDers suffer from, but there are others that are very important to meet the criteria for a diagnosis.

Remember that most ADHD symptoms are something that almost all people suffer from to some extent, and that it becomes a disorder when it's a significant impairment on your life and prevents you from accomplishing your goals, which for you it sounds like isn't the case.

Of course, I don't know you, so I'm not in a position to judge whether or not you have ADHD or not, that's for a psychiatric professional to decide.

The doctor isn't going to laugh at you or humiliate you, these are people who went through years of training and schooling because they wanted to help people. You're just going to get checked out, it's not like you're trying to tell him you're 100% sure you have ADHD and you need medication for it, you scheduled an appointment because your curious, and the doctor's job is to determine whether or not your curiosity is correct or not. If they did laugh at you or humiliate you then that would be a very, very unprofessional and, for that matter, inconsiderate and insensitive, doctor.

I'd say you have nothing to worry about. Just don't go into the appointment expecting the doctor to agree with you right off the bat, and be willing to accept it if the doctor tells you that he doesn't think you fit the diagnosis. Good luck!","d8h3dyz",3,1475792946,"2016-10-06 22:29:06"

There's nothing wrong with thinking about what you need to say ahead of time. Think about it like a regular doctor's appointment. ""These are my symptoms, and here's how they are impacting my life"" is a good way to organize your thoughts. The impacting your life part is important, particularly if it's something that is quantifiable, like grades. 

It's ok that you feel bad or like your faking it. It's not good (it's a particularly shitty feeling), but you aren't doing anything wrong. It's a common response.

ADHD is the literally your brains inability to create a chemical. Adderall is the replacement. Yes. If your brain creates the chemical that you're using the drug to replace, it is basically a hard drug. However, for people who are prescribed the medication legitimately, it is a medication.

"3978","Just thought I'd throw my two cents in - medication can be a great tool, but you also have to take the initiative for it to be beneficial. 

I was prescribed Elvanse (Vyvanse in other countries) recently, and when I took it I felt the rushy 'come up', my mind cleared of background noise, and then I would endlessly and obsessively scroll through social media thinking 'this is what I did before meds, I thought this stuff was meant to help my impulsiveness?!', and then I'd feel tired and emotional. I WFH so would sit at my desk and do literally nothing, thinking 'maybe I don't have ADHD after all because these meds are actually making my concentration worse!'.

Well, I had to go into the office to do some tasks I couldn't do from home, and I was so concerned it would be like it was when I was at home - impossible to work - but no! I knew I had to work, and once I got started it was amazing! I was in the zone all day, working, and didn't even take a lunch break because I had the motivation to finish. I got so much done, and most surprisingly found it much easier to do the jobs I used to procrastinate to the max before (like having to move away from my desk to scan files, eurghhh). I didn't feel fatigued and instead of feeling sad I felt happy and productive with a sense of achievement. I returned some old documents to archive, which I used to put off doing before because it's so monotonous, but it was on my to do list and it got done. Amazing.

I think I had originally assumed, as some of the pro-medication threads on here seem to suggest, that taking this capsule would instantly transform me into someone that was proactive, productive, not a procrastinstor (all the p's!), as if the medication somehow immediately makes you neurotypical and transforms your life without any effort on your part. This is not true. You also have to take some initiative and direct the benefits of the medication to the tasks you want to complete. You'd be disappointed like I first was if you expect to take it and just suddenly be super focussed on the things that you don't want to do.

As with most medication, it is a *tool*. How you use it to maximise its benefits is up to you :)","g380m0r",1,1598687918,"2020-08-29 07:58:38"

"3995","[Sorry, this ended up being way longer than I anticipated!]

Hm, that's a tough one. What you described was pretty much my entire life before I got medicated: Big work projects were late because I focused way too much on minor details, it took days to clean my room because I would inevitably begin dumping out the contents of some random box and become fascinated by what's inside...

But, I have to say that one of the biggest improvements after starting meds (Ritalin) was finally being able to prioritize. Before, it was as though whatever came across my desk was the No. 1 priority, which, in my particular workplace, meant I could never get things done. Now it's a lot easier to block out and save the small stuff for later. 

However, there are still some bad habits that I've developed over years of dealing with ADHD that the meds don't really help. For example, I used to ALWAYS, ALWAYS be late to EVERYTHING because I did not properly how much time I needed to get ready, how long it takes to get somewhere, or just flat out did not notice or pay attention to the time. One of the first things I noticed in the first couple of days on meds was that I actually thought to *check* the time...but now I am just aware of the time and making the conscious effort to leave when I feel like leaving. Meds don't fix bad habits like that, it seems. 

But my disaster of a room remained a disaster until I started taking antidepressants. I always dreaded cleaning my room, and even when I was better at staying on task and focusing, I still could not see the point. After I started on Celexa, though, something changed: Cleaning my room *made me feel good.* I enjoyed, for the first time in YEARS, knowing where my stuff is, decorating my room and not being too embarrassed to allow anyone to see it. 

Anyway, have you considered adding antidepressants? It may help you to allow yourself to feel just as rewarded by finishing assignments as you are doing some online shopping! :)","cp0221e",8,1425145620,"2015-02-28 17:47:00"

I'm 48 and I still haven't found a foolproof method. I will sometimes forget to set the timer, others I wiĺl stop it and forget it rang, sometimes I would set it but won't start it. I write things in all of the calendars and forget to look at them, or forget to write things, look at them and see them empty.

I oscillate between the panic that I'm forgetting something and the silliness of being 45 minutes early because I'm afraid of missing it at all (and nearly being late anyway because I forgot to take my mobile off the charger and had to ran upstairs and almost missed the train.)

"4046","&gt; If you're taking Adderall, it's basically methamphetamine.

It's Dextroamphetamine. Sure it shares ""amphetamine"" in the name, but it's not the same thing. Honestly I would compare it to straight amphetamine (AKA speed) if anything.

&gt; The high will wear off and you'll be dependent on it.

When you're prescribed ADD/ADHD medications the doctor will wean you onto it (or at least they should). You'll start out at 5mg for a week or so, then go up to 10mg for a week, 15mg, etc. until you found the perfect dosage that works for you. This ""perfect dosage"" is extremely individualized and depends on many factors, including your body mass and how ""extreme"" your ADHD is. 

The process of weaning lets your body gradually get use to the side-effects of the drug before you get to that ""perfect dosage"". I know from experience that weaning basically makes it so you never actually experience a high from the medication, at least not significantly.

&gt; I was on 40 mg a day of Adderall

40mg is a fairly high dosage, I'm prescribed 30mg and I don't think I'd even want to go to 35mg. If a person, regardless of being ADD/ADHD or not, took the medication starting at 40mg, you would most definitely get the high. And yes, your body would eventually start to develop a tolerance to the effects, and the high would decrease, thus meaning you would need to take higher dosages to achieve that same level of high.

Though the point of Adderall isn't to get ""high"". It's suppose to motivate you so you can more easily focus on things. I guess we could debate what the meaning of ""high"" is in this context, but generally speaking it's usually used when talking about using drugs for recreation.

And for the remark on dependency, that's absolutely true. You will become dependent on it. Dependency is something that happens with almost every aspect in life though, for example we are dependent on water and food to survive. 

Though with drugs I can concede it's not usually a good thing. If you're dependent on a drug, the worst thing that could happen is that you loose access to that drug. So definitely make sure you have a medical plan if you are going to be taking Adderall, or any medication really.

&gt; It's terrible for you physically.

It's definitely not the best drug for your body, but I wouldn't say it's absolutely terrible. The worst side effect I've gotten is vasoconstriction, where your blood vessels tighten up and raise your blood pressure. It can be very easy to get a sleepy leg and such, and I commonly have cold hands/feet. Appetite reduction can also be a very negative effect, especially when you're already a picky eater (like me). Though it can also seem like a positive effect if you're overweight, but I highly discourage using amphetamines for the purposes of weight loss.

Anxiety is a major fallback imo. I find myself very anxious about a lot of things, but that's also a symptom of ADHD itself. I find adderall is great at amplifying how you feel emotions, so if you're anxious you can become extremely anxious, if your happy you can become extremely happy, etc. Though anxiety is an extremely common side-effect of taking amphetamines, especially in an uncontrolled environments, this is why you see a lot of ""sketched out"" methamphetamine/cocaine users.

Most of these side effects go away when you've been taking the medication long enough, and generally are fairly manageable.

Now one last thing before I end my rant: Adderall does not cure you of ADD/ADHD, nor is it a perfect solution. Even if you find Adderall works great, it isn't the solution to your disorder. People thing they can just pop pills and all their problems will be solved, but that's not true. Medication for ADD/ADHD doesn't just fix the problem, but it does make it a lot more manageable. Therapy is a good solution for dealing with ADD/ADHD but it's not fool proof and many cannot develop the skills they need with therapy alone. This is why the best solution is to take medication and also receive therapy. The medication gives you an ""even playing ground"" for you to develop the skills you need.

tldr:

* Adderall is *not* the same thing as meth.

* When properly medicated you're weaned on and won't really ever feel a ""high"".

* Dependency is real but it's kind of irrelevant if you have a constant supply.

* The side effects can be nasty, but are fairly manageable and not really all that dangerous.

* Adderall isn't a cure, it's a crutch. You'll still have to learn how to use it properly and therapy is best used in conjunction.","djm5edy",3,1498847841,"2017-06-30 18:37:21"

"4053","TLDR: Guilt, perfectionism, finding comfort in what's familiar




I feel like I'm stagnant out of guilt sometimes. I don't actively think ""you dont deserve to start a garden because you haven't wrote that paper for class or gotten an oil change"", but there have been many times where I've decided to say ""fuck it"" and do something fun and then have felt guilty about it the next day because I could have used that time more wisely. I feel guilty in general for wasting so much time in my 20s, and that guilt can compound until I'm left feeling paralyzed.




I was taught that if I was going to do something, I better do it right the first time. This was told to me as a child while I raced to my HW or chores and I was sloppy about it. I was always made to redo these things until it was done right. Unfortunately, I now regrettably feel this way as an adult. I complicate the smallest tasks.





Example: Cleaning my bathroom. I cant just quickly wipe everything down, it will feel half assed, but the idea of scrubbing the shower, scrubbing the toilet, cleaning every knook and cranny of the toilet and sink feels overwhelming at times, so I'll continously put it off. If I do things ""half ass"" I will often feel anxiety about it. I'm actively working on this with my therapist, learning to be okay with not doing the elaborate preparations/executions.




At this point, I'm so used to procrastinating and it hasnt completely blown up my life, that now it almost encourages me to continue to put stuff off because it's not like anything super bad will happen. This is familiar to me, procrastinating and falling short is a known discomfort. An unknown and scary discomfort would be to force myself to actually get shit done.




I'm extreme. Some days I wake up and want to do it all, I'll make a mile long list and instead of only aiming to do 2 or 3 things, I expect myself to do them all, because I sat down and convinced myself, hour by hour, that I could indeed do these 40 things in one day.

When I was little (7ys) was diagnosed add, and I was also a little unusual for a female with ADD. I was not shy at all, I was nearly as rambunctious as boys with ADD. Hella talkative, count t sit for more then a few then a few minutes Parents just said, no, she's very smart and just plain stubborn. She can do it, she just chooses not to. Yeah, I was 7.

Well, life moved along, I was in trouble alot. Not law breaking, but mostly a smart-ass back talker, and cause I was so smart, I argued every single rule, food made  to eat that made me gag, (oh yeah being stubborn there too) A year later, I was in a foster home. 

Flash forward, life happens I manage in much the same way vision does when I lose or break my glasses and have to wait 6 +months to afford a new pair. But I'd completely forgotten about the add, like I remember vaguely about the diagnosis but that's it. So everyone just assumed I grew out of it.

Nope, thanks to my ""smarts"" I learned to sit still, watch people's reactions and compensate in big ass ways. But that all came crashing down in my early 40s.

I read on a different sub from someone who themselves has ADHD and they said that their emotional hyperarousal causes them to get reaaally upset and overstimulated so he’s not thinking rationally at that time, so his SO will remind them that it’s ok and they give them space to calm down and  once he cools off he can process things rationally.

Get tested and try some meds. Just for studying. The difference is so big it's unreal. So for those tests you have coming up. Try your best but if you fail. Know that you will ace them when you have those meds. And don't feel bad that you have to use those meds to be able to do things like studying. Your brain works differently and the only thing those meds do is make your brain function like a normal brain.","girk69b",5,1610289326,"2021-01-10 14:35:26"
"4064","The way he acts is unusual. No empathy and understanding what is appropriate. That's what I meant. Most of the toxic people know at least how to manipulate, but this dude ... he just tells what he thinks xD

""ohh I thought you killed yourself"" Master of manipulation xD I would be like wtf xD 

Not gonna lie. I lack empathy as well, but IRL at least I fake it to not offend people or be perceived as weird. Or if that happens, they know I am only joking, because I smile or laugh. Okay, they probably know I lack empathy and I am fucked up because I was literally laughing and making fun of things I should not.

It's more like fucked up humor. I enjoy dark humor. I am never angry at people. People can just be offended the way I act, because it's very insensitive. 

Their reactions are like ""wtf? xD"" Okay I am the same like OP's man. Fucked up, weird, crazy, and I enjoy that xD I am dancing, listening music now.

"4066","I got through high school because I had a strong support system. I was in a program for students with learning disabilities, I am dyslexic as well, and in retrospective the things they had me do were more designed to help me with adhd then dyslexia. I had an hour long study hall all 4 years where I had to meet with a counselor and tell them what I was working on and what I had to finish. I got extended time for tests. I was not allowed to become to disorganized, I had days in the middle of every semester where all I was allowed to do was reorganize myself. All that helped and allowed me to develop really very good coping mechanisms. 

The first 2 years of college kicked my ass and I almost dropped out. I had to learn how to cope on my own and spent the better part of my college career struggling with work. I finally went into a psych and was diagnosed with adhd. I've been on adderal for 5 days now and honestly it's like my brain just calmed down. 

I wish I had been diagnosed sooner but my mom is convinced it's a made up disorder. That stimulant medicines are awful and that you just need to work harder or different. So Ya I got diagnosed at 22 but have been struggling unmedicated my whole life. 

Honestly I thought a lot of what I was dealing with was normal and I just wasn't as smart as my peers. I am really angry I was not diagnosed in high school because I have lost a lot of chances because of it. ","cqq6xim",2,1430140751,"2015-04-27 13:19:11"

"4069","This happens to me a lot with my Adderall. Some times it completely shits out on me, other times it’s a bit much. I suggest taking a holiday from it. I’m at the point where my Adderall isn’t working again. I was taking it maybe 3 times a week at the most. Deff enough to build a tolerance. It’s hard to find an in between some times. If I don’t take it enough the side effects are a bit much at times. But if I take it multiple times a week my body and brain gets use to it. So the medicine doesn’t really work to it’s full potential. I’d deff go on a holiday. I’ve been on Adderall ir 20 mgs for maybe two years now. I started off with 20 n that was too strong so did 10mgs. Now I’m up to 50mgs. Which is a no go for me. I won’t go passed 60. Plus that’s way too much meds for a person who takes it 3 times a week. Or at least I feel that way. That’s so many pills and just a dose I don’t want. But yeah my meds shit out on me last week. I took them today, took 45 mgs. But nothing really happened. So I’ll try to hold off for 2 weeks. Every ones body is different. I’m surprised you’ve been on it so long n this is just happening now. Hmm. So yes! You need a holiday and try to change up your diet! Eat healthy foods. Veggies, fish, chicken. Try some brain food and vitamins! Also staying hydrated and sleeping well definitely has an impact on the meds. Also eating. I’m not sure though if I like to eat with the meds I’m on now. This Adderall script is a bit different then my last for sure. Don’t really know how but it’s is. Eating before or right before it hits me seems to mess up the medication. But good luck to yah!!

"4075","Edit: So long. Too long for an ADHD forum. Silly me. Please read, though, OP. Please. Beeline Reader might help. 

You obediently and faithfully invested in a system that you were taught is the only one worth succeeding in. Maybe even the only one at all. Now you know more, namely that that particular system isn't for you. It's not how you're internally organized. Good to know, right? Breaking away from that system, especially when it works perfectly well for people close to you that you love and respect, is kind of an act of social disloyalty. It's akin to announcing at Christmas Mass that you don't believe in this shit anymore. You willingly separate yourself from the tribe. There is profound danger in separating yourself from the collective social agreements that structure your sense of self and of the world. Don't underestimate the abject terror such a move can provoke. It may not be totally rational, but neither are you, and you're not supposed to be. 

So much of motivation is about feeling. Physical feeling. Imagining and anticipating the feeling of getting what you want can help get you out of bed. It can also make getting out of bed pointless since you just imagined and anticipated the feeling of the result, so why do the thing at all? 

I kind of loathe the concept of ""lifehacking"" but I have learned to hack my ADD in a few useful ways. Primarily, I've realized that what works best for me is lived experience and processing it afterwards. Anticipation and imagination work because they make me nervous and excited and THAT motivates me. I can't motivate myself with my brain. I can't think my way into motivation because I can just as easily think my way out. What I can do is think myself into a state of physical sensory arousal, and use that state as leverage and momentum. I have to FEEL desire and hunger for novelty in my body, like a fundamental need that must be met, or I won't get off the couch for days. If I try to think about how to be fulfilled and motivated and happy, I will die trying. On that motherfucking couch, probably. 

Your brain is a useful tool but it's not the only one you've got. Your body, your senses, your instinct, your guts, your muscle memories. All these are another way of knowing that will lead you irreversibly away from desk jobs and rush hour commutes and fluorescent lighting on 32nd floors of windowless office towers. The good news is that there's another way to be human in this world for which your brain and proclivities are much better suited. There is a way out, as it were, but more importantly, a way forward that could really work for you. The bad news is that you may have to make it up as you go along, without much guidance, support and often with outright hostility. I don't mean that ""follow your bliss"" shit. I suspect you, like me, have no hopes for or expectations of something as abstract and unsustainable as ""bliss""and primarily because what brings you to a blissful state is random, inconsistent, unrepeatable and has diminishing returns. Your bliss is a little minx. She does her own thing, and you are often surprised. 

Which leads me elegantly to my point: abandon all hopes of settling for a desk job life. You can't do it. You'll become a card shark or a bank robber or a gigolo. You need novelty like you need to respirate, and shrugging that off gets you nowhere except a front row seat on the bus to Suck City. Abandon also all hopes of finding your ""passion"". You're not cerebrally structured to have just one. You've already had a few. You will have many more. You will covet your ideas like lovers, and obsess over them, work yourself to the bone in their service, neglect your relationships and hygiene, and wake up one morning without any trace of love for them left. You'll begin again. 

Hear me: This is also easily construed as a pointless repetitive fate, and perhaps more so than a desk job because it may ultimately produce no social currency worth trading. No fancy degrees or tasteful homes in name-brand neighborhoods. No effortless chic haute couture handbags or shaved truffle tastings at exclusive restaurants. Nothing that will easily slot you in among your peers and give you benchmarks to judge one another's success, to rank one another, to find reasons to loathe or fear them. If you opt out of the competition, you are not eligible for a medal. Or the sports drink endorsements. But if you opt out of the competition, you are not competing anymore. What's on the other side of trying to fit in, trying to be good enough, trying to care about dumb shit that you can't take beyond the grave - which is coming for us all and sooner rather than later - trying trying trying? 

To opt out is a nearly unfathomable risk. For someone like you, to opt in is a completely unbearable fate. Only one of those options comes with a guarantee. You don't have to drink absinthe and couch surf and turn your underwear inside out and meditate and disparage the Man and spend the winter in a tipi. I think all you have to do is conclude that your life is going to be unconventional and that you want that - that freedom, that creative tension, that structure of surprise - more than you want anything else, including money, social standing, security and respectable people at your funeral. 

You will be a Dingbat in a Times New Roman world. If you've spent most of your life trying be TNR, or be accepted by them, expect to question your decision to let your Dingbat flag fly. Still, to live by your own terms, your own rules, your own measurements, your own rhythms, your own whims and moods and tides and ideas and to find people who seek your company because of the integrity you've chosen for yourself, is the ground on which you can build the life of freedom and maybe joy that lives in your heart and your dreams. It may live there quietly now, and it may seem far fetched and indulgent, but it will only grow louder, more disruptive and more insistent with time. You will not mellow out or want less out of life or learn to settle or grow comfortable. Your hunger will only increase, your discomfort will wake you up at night, and your anger will incinerate your capacity to hope that tomorrow will be better. 

If the world has not been kind to you thus far, forgive it for not knowing what to do with you. Understand that it operates under limitations that don't confine you, not really. Think about what you want to feel more of, how to feel that more often, how to share it in an unfriendly world so the other Dingbats can find you, so you and the ready ones can do big things, so the unsteady ones can see you in the relative dark of their own couch prisons and learn from you. 

Blaze up, OP, in the way that you long for, and light the way. Dingbats need a hero. Why not you?

And since he is medicated, he should be able to participate with the rest of the children.

- Actually I saw someone else writing about these on this subreddit. Ordered them a day later and was amazed. They are in-ear headphones, not everybody likes those. But: They are good for listening to music while studying in a library or on flights/trains/bus rides etc.  
They're called *kz-zs3 hifi in ear headphones*. On amazon they are tagged as *unbranded*.  
  
For running/sport activities: *YXwin Bluetooth headphones headset in ear for sport gaming (red)*  
They are really practical if you need your hands free or want to move around a lot. Don't use them in a kitchen or bathroom area though, the bluetooth won't work due to interfering humidity.  
  
my fav stay_at_home and study/work noise-cancelling headphones are from Sony and expensive as hell. I got them from my family as my one and only Christmas present - but it's money well spent. As long as you handle them with care and don't use them outside. Personally, I don't like to use expensive NC headphones outside, but to each their own! They also have another function called ""ambient noise"", where they let voices through but cancel other noises. You can also tap pause or skip songs on the headphones as well as put your whole hand on the right part of the headphones and it will turn down the volume of what you're listening to, so you can talk to someone without having to take off the headphones. I compared them for a while with nearly as expensive headphones from Bose, but in the end the features and **sound quality** made me choose the Sony ones in the end. They are over ear btw!  
name: *Sony bluetooth over-ear headphones Noise cancelling | MDR-1000X*  
  
Headphones which I use for on the go: *Sony MDREX50LPW* and old ipod headphones from the 2000s (they even survived an accidental spin in my washing machine).  
  
Headphones for a movie night or watching youtube on my phone/notebook: *Sony MDR-ZX610APR Lifestyle* headphones. They are also useful for skype sessions, because they have a built in headset which also works with android phones. No bluetooth though, just plug them in your phone or computer.","dv66zxm",0,1520183459,"2018-03-04 17:10:59"
"4114","Don't worry! Just try to figure out what you're not that good at, how you might try to help that -  and what you're good at, and how you can do a lot of that. 

Ex: 
I really need to have noise canceling headphones to be able to concentrate. They are expensive, but worth it. I went for the ear bud ones, so they don't seem to ""back off and leave me alone"". 

You can tell people about your weaknesses without saying you have ADHD. I know I'm terrible at remembering stuff, - so I tell people that. ""If I don't write this down', I won't remember it'. 

I'm really good at learning new things, and jumping from topic to topic - and that makes me great for a lot of creative work. 

Since you don't say what bothers you the most, it's hard to be more specific. But relax, and try to spend some time figuring out what might be challenging, and how to help that - and even more important: What are you really good at?

You should talk with whoever is the doctor who is prescribing this med. My son was on Focalin, and I can't remember if that was what made him somewhat anti-social. Your son may be feeling poorly on the medication, and therefore he may be confrontational or angry but actually feeling depressed. Either way, there are meds that could be added to relieve this response, or he could be changed to a different stimulant to see if it's better for his overall mood.

"4130","Call the specialists office and request copies of your medical records, **one for your own personal record**, and also ask them to send a copy of them to your doctor's office. (You'll have to fill out a form or two to do this.)

If the two offices aren't part of the same healthcare organization, your doctor probably can't just get copies of your records without you signing a release, first... so don't wait on them to get the release form and then give it to you, just go ahead and do it. 

After you get your records (it may take a few days or even a couple of weeks, depending on the size and staffing of the office), call and set up an appointment with your doctor. By the time you go in to your appointment, they should have already received a copy of your records from them, as well... but bring your copy of them along, anyways, just so they have no excuses. 

If they still give you the run around, look for another GP or a psychiatrist that is able to prescribe medication and set up a consultation appointment with them, explain that your GP isn't willing to treat your ADHD, despite your diagnosis, and see if they would take you on as a patient. 

Some doctors are weird about prescribing Schedule II medications, such as Adderall (and pretty much all stimulant ADHD medication), so you may simply have to find a different doctor.

(If you do have to look for a different doctor, when meeting with them, I'd emphasize the part about how your doctor is giving you the runaround, not returning your calls, etc., and make it **less** about ""*they won't give me meds!*"" and more about the ""*they aren't treating me*"" part, just so they don't get the impression that you're trying to score drugs and the other doctor just refused to give them to you... because that kind of thing *does* happen.)

When someone tells me I need to listen, I’ve realized what they really mean is “I need to face my shoulders towards them and make eye contact that only breaks a few times.” But what NTs don’t understand is that they can either have my eye contact, or my attention, not both. Maintaining “listening” posture and ignoring other stimuli takes ALL my energy, with none left to actually interpret auditory input. So I’ve learned tricks to not offend (nodding, pursing my lips as if considering, saying “right?!” “Really?!” or “wait, what?!, because those can all be interpreted as exclamations, genuine questions, or prompts for the speaker to continue). 
The absolute WORST is trying to watch tv or a movie, especially because it takes awhile for me to get focused on the plot, and sometimes during a pause or a commercial he will start talking and it takes me a minute to shift from the screen back to him and then put his words in context, and he gets frustrated if he remarks about something on the screen and then I miss it and have to go back. I was actually starting to hate watching tv with him.

Jigsaw Puzzles

They keep
My hands and eyes busy, but are mindless, so they leave my ears and brain open to actually listen (whether that is to him, or to a movie). If it’s a movie, I will sometimes listen to, but not watch whole scenes, so we save action films or other wordless entertainment for times that I can’t give the movie 100% of my focus. If it’s a conversation, he takes my lack of eye contact a lot less personally when I’m not in my phone, even though candy crush was serving the same purpose, the fact that he can also see and participate in the jigsaw if he wants to helps him know that I’m not just fake listening.

Getting pissed off or feelings hurt or mad at myself means the whole day is going up in flames possibly if I don't catch myself...and sometimes there's no catching myself.  I'm 41 y'all and not even a particularly hot-headed person.  It just makes me lose track of any structure or plan when I get emotional.  I will say learning to be aware of it and turning negative thinking into a more grateful viewpoint helps more than I can believe sometimes (like I hate ""whatever"" vs. at least I made it this far even dealing with ""whatever"" and now I'm on a better path most days).  When I can get myself on that level, I find I can break through the BS.  Also just not crap-talking myself in my head.  Be your friend if you can.

I will sit down to study just for an hour, pretending the material is just homework. This will really help me relax and steer my focus away from my fear of failure. I will also simultaniously do some laundry to feel more productive and like I'm achieving SOMETHING.

"4168","It's so dependent on the child, I think. I can't speak so much to what might have worked for me as a child, but I know that as an adult, I'm *really* benefiting from meditation and mindfulness. Just sitting there and trying to be calm didn't work, but guided meditation has really helped me. I also started doing a lot of yoga and stretching at a slower pace. It forced me to slow down, when all I wanted to do was rush through it.

I started honestly just by stretching and doing yoga and just mindfully moving while watching sports or a movie or something (you know how we like to do 8 things at once). And then got into meditation and things like that. I like to think of meditation as having your mind try to be a mountain, and thinking of your thoughts as clouds passing by.

Again, I don't know if that would work when I was 8 years old, by any means, but just sharing how I've been able to make progress. I'll always be a work in progress, but I have been better able to think if that makes sense. Well, most days...today I took half an anti-anxiety med by accident instead of a non-drowsy allergy pill. I'm supposed to take those anxiety meds at night, so I've been drowsy all morning, haha! But that's another thing too - actually not hating myself when I'm not at my best. Actually giving myself some grace and kindness and not being in a mode of constant flagellation has helped.

Regular exercise, getting outside, seeing others helps - but I know we're limited right now in what we can do.

Hope that helps a bit!","gttuej2",1,1617900395,"2021-04-08 16:46:35"
"4169","What was involved with getting the diagnosis ? For 300 quid and travel costs  I could easily afford it. My area has no one specialised in adults with adhd &amp; the NHS view is you should have been diagnosed as a child. While that works if your British as a foreigner health care consisted of are you gravely ill if not you did not see a doctor. The only other time I saw a doctor was for injections required to attend school. 

The upside of this is that I don't bother my gp unless I have a real issue. The number of times I have seen people attend a gp's service for a minor ailment annoys me still. 

It's a bit annoying but the site is actually helpful.

If you don’t want to take medication, a doctor is NOT going to force you. If they try to, I would find a new doctor.

There are many different treatment options, for example, you might benefit from an ADHD coach! You’ve been living without medication, and if you don’t think it’s a good idea, I would try any other treatment plan first. Maybe start off by looking into the symptoms and making a list of ways that you think ADHD affects your life, then take that to your doctor and see if there is a way to handle those things without stimulants.

Short animated logo assets usually, but starting to mess around in After Effects. But I definitely feel what you said about choice paralysis and being overwhelmed by digital. I came out of college with a bad burnout on digital graphic design and felt super unprepared, but I enjoy the limitations imposed by things like printmaking, so I went back to what I liked.

"4230","I have been diagnosed with ADD for about 10 years now. I'm only 22, so I don't have a lot of experience with a ""workplace"" environment, but I have worked in an office a bit and been through lots of school. 

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by ""normal"", but medication has made a huge difference in my life. When I take the medication, I am able to focus on my work for long periods of time, so I can get good amounts of it done in one sitting. The thing is, medication is a coping mechanism, not a fix; so you need to do some research and study your own work habits to figure out what other strategies you can use to manage your ADD. (Quiet work environment, speech-to-text software, handwriting vs. typing, etc.)

One of the things about ADD that can be good or bad depending on how you look at it, is our ability to hyper-focus. If you haven't heard of hyper-focusing before, it is the ability to focus on one specific task and block out all other forms of distraction. For me, medication intensifies this ability which is great when i'm working on something important, but not-so-great when i'm distracted by something less important. Usually, if something is of high-interest to you (if you like the job you do) it is easy to hyper-focus on it. If you find something boring and you have no deadline, it might be harder for you to get started on it/ get it done. When I hyper-focus, I often forget to listen to my body as well; meaning I can go for hours working on a project and forget to eat meals, go to the bathroom, or sleep.

So to answer your question, I would say medication doesn't make me ""normal"", it makes me better able to cope with my ADD, and work through it. I still take a bit longer to get things done than most other people, and I require a daily routine that helps me get places on time and make sure I have everything I need for the day. However, the medication helps me focus enough on the tasks at hand that I can function and accomplish the important things in a more timely manner.

Remember that medication is not for everyone, and if it is for you, it sometimes takes a while to get the dose right.

Also, I would look for some of the self-help books that are out there, many can be pretty great resources for finding those coping strategies. Just remember every person is different, so not all strategies work for everyone--start with one thing, not all at once.

Unfortunately, when adults are in a mental health crisis there's not much you can do until they are a danger to themselves or others because they can refuse care. Even if they don't take him to a doctor to be evaluated, it will be on record in case you need that sort of paper trail. If he's trying to divorce you and the problem persists, there will need to be custody arrangements and he doesn't sound like a safe parent. Do what you have to to protect your son.

This sounds like a really tough thing to be going through and I wish you all the best. I'm glad his family are on your side and you can work together to help him.

"4239","Wow, are you me?!?

I've taken Vyvanse for ~2 years, and it's helped wonderfully with every symptom EXCEPT (what I now know is referred to as) RSD. 

I've been in CBT for years, and have marginally improved my outbursts, but they're still frequent (1-2/month). I was searching for answers just yesterday, and discovered RSD.   My Psych prescribes my Vyvanse, and I'm meeting him in a couple of weeks, so I sent him the articles I found on it. 

I have so many questions! I hope you don't mind answering at least a few:

- Did you notice any decrease in energy? 
- Does your medication go through insurance? If so, were there any problems with it?
- I stick to a low carb diet most days.  Have you noticed any problems with fatty foods (I had read elsewhere that you shouldn't take it with a fatty meal, but didn't know if it was OK to take it if eating this way at another time in the day).
- Besides a decrease in outbursts, have you noticed any other positive effects? I struggle with social settings, out of fear of rejection.  I'm wondering if it helps with that aspect, or more so just keeping your cool.

There's also some days that I wish I was still on my meds so I could be more productive. Bud do I NEED them? No. You can train yourself to focus using different coping mechanisms and relaxation and different things. The hardest part is focusing and to not let your mind go off on tangents (a notebook is helpful for this, write down the idea right away so you can go back to what you're supposed to be doing). I stopped taking my meds because I didn't like who I was on them and there was an Adderal shortage and I couldn't fill my perscriptions.

I just want to say O.P., before having a psychiatrist tell me I definitely have ADHD, I had the same fear. Am I trying to find an excuse for my laziness or stupidity? Am I making this up in a cry for help? Am I going insane???

The good news is, you’re not insane, and these feelings are not only a perfectly normal experience for those of us with ADHD, but indeed most people who struggle with atypical mental health issues.

My Mum (who is the most classic undiagnosed case of ADHD you could ever meet) said to me: “I don’t think you have ADHD, I think you just need to kick it up a gear.” 

It’s almost like people are afraid of the thought of us having ADHD like it’s some sort of curse, or even better, like it’s a made up illness and an excuse. Even the ones who are accepting of it still can’t fully experience what we go through on a daily basis, so their attempts at relating can be a bit clumsy.

"4277","&gt; Your fears of failing miserably based on a fantasy you've created in your head

Actually, they're based on a few failings I had when starting out in accounting (while unmedicated) and my time in college, including failing out of an attempt at a bachelor's (while unmedicated). It was at the college that I was first diagnosed, actually, based on why I was failing the classes. My teachers said I was bright and had a good understanding of the material, but I wasn't getting the homework in and would miss classes due to sleep schedule issues, which in turn was due to my ""just one more"" mentality around bedtime.

Again, all of this happened while unmedicated, but I also don't have anything while medicated to compare it to other than my big box retail job of one year, lol. And while I accept now that some of my accounting failings were a) I didn't know any better due to being new to working in general and/or b) I was set up to fail by my boss, I still haven't really dealt with the raw emotions of those failures or something. Honestly I don't have a clue how to start to do that.

Children, or even adults, may try to express a complain in a concealed way, so concealed that even they cannot see it. If you assume this is the case, then trying to find the reason(s) may solve the problem.

For example, sometimes my 3 years old daughter traps me: she says something looking at me, expecting that I answer, then when I speak she complains that I should have stayed silent and her mother answered instead. When I see such bizarre behaviour I realise she may (i) have a pain somewhere, (ii) have constipation or something, (iii) who knows what else. I start by trial and error and usually I discover it.

"4298","Yeah, something similar happened to me near the end of December when I had 3 days left to write a research review paper for a 4th-year university class.

Things we're not going well in the slightest, and I was starting to get all emo and frustrated as all hell. Psychotherapist just looked at me and shook her head and said, ""Cut yourself some slack, man. I understand that you feel ineffective, and exhausted; but that makes perfect sense: you've worked on this for at least 10 hours a day for the last week and a half. Anyone in that situation would be exhausted, and losing focus and productivity. — It doesn't match how much or how little you've gotten done: you've been working your ass off, and you should be proud of that!"" &lt;/paraphrase&gt;

She definitely has a point. **We need** to recognize and celebrate our hard work, even if it's relatively fruitless. While the depressing reality is that nobody else really gives a fuck (IE: the results are the only thing matter); and nobody is else is going to celebrate that we overcame our horrendous ADHD-level inefficiency.

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't! Count the hours of trying to work as work. Count any progress you make as work. Forget that it took twice as long as it 'should have', or wasn't done in one sitting without interruptions: it's a victory, and the effort is commendable!","dslkjyq",4,1515804119,"2018-01-13 00:41:59"

"4301","this is something that I've actually been in a situation where I had to address this issue directly to the person making light of it. 

There's an effect of having ADHD or any mental/neurological disorder that most people don't understand. (and it's not their fault if it's never been explained to them because they don't have the experience to know that it is even a thing). 

If you were to ask most people who know me, they would tell you that I'm generally confident in myself, competent, and generally have my shit together. and while those descriptors don't necessarily work as an absolute statement they are for the most part accurate. 

until i'm around my family. See, most people who are not family don't know that I have ADHD. They see all the same successes that I've had over the last few years but their perception of it is colored completely differently. They see someone who graduated highschool, chose not to go to college and worked through a few different jobs getting better and better positions at each until i'm now one step away from my goal for where i want to be for the majority of my career. 

My family sees the kid that has always had ADHD but hasn't always had treatment. The kid that would spend 4 hours on a single math homework assignment in 5th grade (example because math has always been my strongest). they see the kid that has somehow managed despite consistently fucking up. 

I was diagnosed in middle school then was re-evaluatated just after graduating so i could make sure for myself that it was legit and not just energetic 13 year old with a misdiagnosis and it wasn't until then that I got serious about treatment and managing it. 

most of this with my family is on a subconcious level but any time i fail, it's expected. When I succeed or accomplish something i set out to it's a surprise. A lot of it is innocent banter and jabs between siblings or parents but the same doesn't happen with the rest. success is expected and assumed for them.

The last time I remember accomplishing anything and knowing that their thoughts weren't of ADHD was when I placed first at my high school district swim meet. when i took the stand and got my medal there wasn't a doubt that all my family saw was me and my hard work that got me there. I worked my ass off and I reached my goal. 

That was 7 years ago. 

Since then I've married an amazing woman, I'm probably about a year away from a job as a developer and out of my siblings I live the most comfortably. but at no point along the way has it felt like it did then where all they saw in my accomplishment was me.

I know this isn't everyone's experience but i'm confident that nobody who truly has to battle with ADHD makes it very long without emotional baggage at least. 

also I want to say, don't get me wrong about my family. they're fantastic and I love them. any of this stuff that they do is out of ignorance due to lack of experience and my not explaining this for them. I'm still torn on whether or not to tell them all of this though because I know that if i tell them all of this then I'll never know if their praise or support when I succeed or fail is fully genuine or if they're trying to not hurt my feelings by seeming surprised or not. I'd rather let time and my accomplishments change their expectations. 

and to anyone who falls into the ""lol i'm so ADHD"" trend don't mistake my acceptance and plan for dealing with this for being ok. My awareness doesn't change the fact that I have emotional burdens in addition to what I would have if I didn't have ADHD. 

so yeah, fuck ADHD. this shit sucks and nobody who truly knows it's effects would be flippant about it or claim to have it when they don't.

4-I have yet to find a valid reason to tell someone I have ADHD.

My brother was very distractable - he did fine when isolated from the rest of the classroom, but that was only feasible while in elementary school. Plus, we did farm work with my dad a lot and when he would get distracted he would ""mess up"" which was sometimes an annoyance, sometimes a safety issue. He couldn't concentrate on school work so he had dismal grades, doesn't read well, was in ""remedial"" classes so that made him feel marginalized, and eventually just gave up.

I’m on Adderall IR but I don’t really feel more “calm” per se; just more able to focus. I was told by my neuropsych team that Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, the latter of which is what Vyvanse’s lisdexamfetamine becomes because it’s a prodrug) doesn’t do as much for hyperactive or impulsive symptoms and tends to work better on inattentive ones for some patients. Perhaps he is ADHD-C but has decided for whatever reason that his inattentive symptoms are more bothersome than hyperactive symptoms. 

I know it seems annoying that some people might be getting drugs when they don’t seem to need it, but you are also not a healthcare provider nor their provider, so it’s probably better to focus on what you can do to help your symptoms and not worry about someone else’s life.

Also, like half the posts on this subreddit are from people who got diagnosed after age 12, or even 18+, so that’s not exactly a great piece of proof he “doesn’t deserve” to use Vyvanse.","fap9uqs",1,1576283582,"2019-12-14 00:33:02"

Phenylpiracetam is a lot better, imo. Piracetam tends to just make me sleepy and kind of stoned feeling - not really a good kind of stoned, more like I've taken some over-the-counter allergy medication after not sleeping well the night before.
Phenylpiracetam makes me social, motivated, logical. I tend to study for hours and hours under its effect. I imagine you'd have a good time studying music theory, not sure about actually playing or composing as I gave that up a long time ago. (I'm no good at it)
If you're just looking for something to make music sound better while improving your expression-related skills I'd suggest cannabis.

"4402","The reason these feelings feel fake is because we say ""rationally, I should not feel this way. I am aware that me feeling like this/acting like this is irrational"". Finding something irrational doesn't mean it's fake!

My counselor explained it like this to me: ""So the pre-frontal cortex is what's responsible for executive functioning type things. Decisions, responses, etc. It doesn't finish developing until your 25. The amygdala develops soon after the brain stem (oldest part of the brain), and is responsible for like... emotional responses. Expression, all that. So when something happens to a toddler, the amygdala fires off and that's why the expression of their emotion is so visceral. Because that's what they have. So if you struggle with executive dysfunction, and that pre-frontal cortex isn't preventing the amygdala from being full-volume... you can see where I'm going with that.""

""So that's why I have toddler crying fits.""

""I wouldn't call them that, but that's an explanation for your emotional dysregulation.""

What I suggest is practicing mindfulness of your emotions. I've gotten pretty good at being able to tell if a crying fit is afoot. I literally announce, ""I'm going to cry soon,"" to friends, who are of course confused if they don't know that's a thing that happens. Being able to recognize the feeling of strong emotions approaching allows me to do whatever I need to do to mitigate that. Change my plans for after classes/work, maybe I'll just go home. Take a shower. I'll eat something. Go for a walk, or I'll leave a group hangout a little early. Even just letting my friends know can help me. There are many that don't understand it, which can hurt, but the friends I have that *do* get it really help me feel a lot better about it.","f5c04mz",1,1572128473,"2019-10-26 22:21:13"

I totally get why you would do the dishes later but my mother for example can't stand it at all when  the dishes aren't done immediately. When me and my dad both smoked she would start with the dishes and we would help when we got back. It didn't matter that we told her to wait, she just couldn't. This may be the case with your wife; I'd ask her.

I don't know if the stuff with getting food after your appointment is a one time thing or not. Sounds like she was just having a bad day but if she wasn't, I would really talk to her if I were you and ask her if you're really that infuriating to her. Sit her down and ask her why she reacts that way to you. Also, lay down some boundaries. This has really helped me when having issues with my SO. Once I told him that the way he acted around other people sometimes made me feel insecure, for example, and that I just couldn't take him acting that way. We had fought about that before but could never find a solution until I told him I wouldn't take it any longer. Then he started to think about his behaviour and told me why he acted  that way. From there we fixed it; I worked on my part and he worked on his.

If there's one thing I've learned about relationships  is that if something the other person does bothers you, you should tell them that and ask them WHY they do it. Give them some time to think. Maybe even a few days. Sometimes they don't even know why until they think about it. And if you just get mad, the other person will want to defend themself instead of trying to understand you. So don't attack her about it, just ask her and tell her how it makes you feel.

"4407","I used to have horrible sleep patterns. And just accepted the fact sleep sucks for me. I ended up with a job where I needed to learn how to sleep. 

1) because of training for said job, I ended up finding out the best studying method for me too 
2) I tried to be aware of what MAKES me sleepy, what keeps me up and etc 


Oof ok back to my point 
1) do 5 mins (at least 5 mins of chores) gets me tired enough to fall asleep - right before sleeping
2) exhaust everything by everything I mean everything when It comes to staying awake during the day. No naps. Or whatever 
3) having naps makes it harder for me to fall asleep 
4) avoid caffeine. Only use sparingly. 
5) get anything and everything that’s meant to relax a person. (I’ve tried essential oils and more)
6) find out your optimal sleeping environment (black out curtains and etc) 
7) weirdly enough don’t do meditation. Meditation keeps me more awake. 
8) find a hobby that makes you sleepy (I’ve tried certain hobbies that actually makes me feel tired enough to fall asleep) 

But this brings me back to #2 of my point, I guess I made myself more aware of the things that make me sleepy and the things that keep me awake at night. 

I do still have nights where I want to scream my head off because my brain decides to just think about every little mistake, conversation and etc. But I try to focus on finding ways for me to sleep. 

Btw some times when you do find a way to make yourself fall asleep, in eventuality it won’t work anymore.

The doctor will ask you a series of questions that will help him/her determine if you have ADHD, and if so, which kind of ADHD (there are 2, plus a third that is a combination of the 2)

These aren't right/wrong questions, and it's not a test. If you'd like to know the type of questions you're likely to be asked, check out the [Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1) Symptom Checklist](https://add.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adhd-questionnaire-ASRS111.pdf).

The conversation with the doctor will probably not upset you or scare you, because there's nothing bad or scary about it. At the end of it, the doctor will tell you what he/she thinks is going on with you, and hopefully why (make sure you ask the why). He/she may also suggest medicine to try to see if that will help. The doctor's opinion will be based on everything the doctor has learned from study and from seeing thousands of people over the years and learning about them.

"4420","Right now ADHD is affecting my dating life hugely. I was diagnosed a couple of years ago, and the road to effective treatment is long and rocky. I'm not managing my condition very well at the moment, and it has become a bit of an obsession.

I put a lot of my energy into thinking about ADHD. It's a big part of my story at the moment. But there are also some bad emotional habits that I've picked up from my previous relationship. I look externally for a lot of my motivation and validation - not being able to direct myself very well I try and find direction in others. So I was doing that with my GF, externalising my goals using her to set the goalposts. It didn't work too well because she was reluctant to fill that role.

So now I'm wary of doing that again. But I haven't found an effective way to set the goals myself. So when meeting somebody new, I want to talk to them about these challenges, and I am really wary of trying to put too much onto them and set them up as a ADHD coach type thing.

This has made it quite difficult to get into dating again. I'm isolated and lonely, but wary of trying to make connections when I'm aware of my neediness so much.

Trying to work on myself to get past this but it's difficult. Not getting much done.","cvpy27o",3,1444127721,"2015-10-06 10:35:21"

"4432","I know nothing about the severity of his symptoms, his ADHD sub-type, or his body mass: but 54mg of Ritalin seems like an awful lot for a twelve year old. I have been taking methylphenidate or amphetamine salts for a couple of years now, but have never taken more than 40mg/day; and certainly not in one dose.

When taking 36mg capsules of Concerta  (a 12-hour release brand of Methylphenidate) I found that the release was not at all consistent. I was productive and 'normal' after it kicked in late in the morning, feeling uncomfortably energetic during the peak after noon hour, and crashed and got irritable by 4:00pm. Could this be what your son is experiencing?

I tried taking 20mg extended/delayed release twice daily and found this a lot more consistent (and flexible), which worked well. Still not ideal, but much better. It was also a bit annoying having to pack my meds around with me, especially considering that they are a high-demand street drug and a target for theft and abuse.

About a year ago I switched to Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine, which is taken in its inactive form and must be activated by red blood cells -- this activation occurs at a relatively constant rate which provides a more level and lasting effect.) While I found that I needed to take a slightly higher dose to get the same effect (50mg Vyvanse compared to 40mg methylphenidate), it was a smoothe and consistent effect that lasted throughout the day. Because this drug is quite expensive I had some issues with insurance and haven't been taking it long enough or consistently enough to fairly judge its efficacy or dosing. If you have good insurance it might be worth talking to you son and arranging a conversation with a qualified practitioner.

It is also worth noting that if (in the future) you have reason to be concerned that your son is abusing his medication, Vyvanse is a better option.

Hope this helps. ;)","d7koeg0",2,1473746973,"2016-09-13 06:09:33"

I don't think I experienced withdrawal during the switch. I didn't taper down or anything, just took my normal dose of lexapro one night and the next night I took the equivalent of Zoloft. The equivalent dose of lexapro wasn't enough for me to feel a therapeutic effect so I increased the Zoloft dose after a week. During that week that my Zoloft dose was too low, I did feel depressive symptoms (easily angered, lack of motivation, etc) but it wasn't too extreme. After increasing my Zoloft dose, I feel pretty great... similar to how I felt on lexpro but less side effects. I haven't tried Effexor.

My teachers pretty much didn't give a fuck, and them not giving a fuck pretty much made me not interested in learning one bit (I would go up to my intermediate algebra teacher and ask her to explain fucking algebraic word problems to me, and she'd tell me to read the book more. The book was obviously not helping, so why not explain? more info: it was a homestudy program, it was their responsibility to check our modules and explain parts that we didn't get, just in case someone says ""teacher is not tutor, don't rely on him/her). Geometry (and word problems involving triangles) however, I actually learned. Statistics, I got all zeroes in the quizzes but saved my grades with midterms and finals.

Also, I'm Asian with typical Asian parents. A C is an F. Anything lower than an A- is an F. Mediocrity is something not handled well in my household -_- I won't get disowned, but I live to see my parents smile.

"4461","I can relate to some of this. I moved abroad and it very rarely occurs to me to contact friends. Every now and again (like every few months) something will remind me and I'll send everyone an individual ""Hey, how's it going? How did X turn out?"" type message. This usually takes maybe ten mins, and usually wins me brownie points because most my friends also forget to message me. 

I *never* open messages unless I'm gonna reply immediately. Yes, this does mean some messages go unread for ages, but at least I can keep tabs on which I've got left. I add replying to my to do list, and then use it as procrastination from work (lols). This is probably somewhat self selecting, as friends who hate that I'm irregular at contacting them have just faded away, and I'm OK with that.

If we're gonna have a proper catch up I used to invite them for a dog walk, as I can focus much better while moving, or if it's over the phone I keep my hands busy (e.g., knit) which helps me focus. These options are both better than messaging or emails, from which it's easier for me to get distracted.

For every message or comment I make about myself, I try and balance it with a question about them. This probably comes across as a bit forced but if nothing else it's a good reminder for me to put the brakes on sometimes. I have even set 5 min vibrate alerts on my phone to help me track time, in case I am dominating a phone conversation.

All that said... I only contact some of my friends 1-3 times a year, and that seems to work well for us. More often and we run out of things to update each other with. Some friends I've lost contact with because it was fairly clear that either one of us or neither of us was suuuper bothered about keeping the friendship alive. And that's OK! (Although that was a hard lesson to learn.)

The phone conversations do tend to really tire me out though. The only person I've ever felt energised being around is a friend in my new country who got diagnosed with ADHD just before me, and a few years into our friendship. ADHD friends are great. I've never been energised by a friend before and it's a great experience, and has really changed my idea of what friendships actually look like.

I am waffling so gonna stop, but.. no idea if that helps! I think the easily distracted part could well be linked to ADHD, but I'm not sure about the rest.

But over all I'm glad I did take part.
One of the bigger cons is that in a group you do not always have time and space to go deep into some stuff. For me, there were some things that got lost in the group process. On the other hand, being among peers can be really great. At one point I was trying to explain something to the group therapist, but couldn't put it into words, when one of the others chimed in and put my feelings exactly in the right words. Like he felt what I felt, and in a way, he did. Moments like these were really helpful.

People try to please other people by bashing other people in front of other people simply to preserve their own image as a caring person. It is rooted in their own insecurities. I hope she didn’t claim afterwards when you confronted her about it that it wasn’t a big deal, cause obviously it was. That would be invalidation

Don’t blame yourself. You have a predisposition to react to this kind of thing with plenty of emotion, which is okay, especially if you knew for a fact you were not purposely trying to dominate (or mansplain) your own mother.

Your wife should has to focus on herself and work on any possible insecurities she may have herself, just as you have yourself sought out help for situation, which she knows about, and maybe your mom, also? You’re doing your part. And you are being You. Be you and be the best you can! I’ll add here, watch out for blaming every reaction you have on your diagnosed condition, cause it will be easier for people to use that against you.

I don’t mean to be so negative here, but people have issues themselves... at the root of themselves, which can make it harder than it should be for everyone else around them, especially if you have ADHD or any other condition.

Also, what exactly is mansplaining? I know where she is coming from, but who in the world did she get this term from?

We (people with ADHD) can already be so beat up by our stimulated (or lack thereof) brains that we don’t need other unnecessary triggers/accusations

When I started vyvanse, I really hated the side effects at first. They did markedly improve by the 1 month point, but I still wasn't satisfied so I switched to adderall xr. Maybe because I had already adjusted a bit to amphetamines from vyvanse, I found adderall xr to just be effective without a weird adjustment period.

"4538","Well, I believe that we have to dive a bit deeper here, and set a distinction between gaslighting and disagreeing. When two people have divergent points based on their own opinions and experiencies, but have enough respect to understand these differences, they’re disagreeing, and that’s exactly what my argument was. Gaslighting has an entirely different meaning. Gaslighting is a form os psychological abuse/manipulation, where you question one’s sanity, memories and reality. If you work on the psychology field, you’d normally have one line of approach, while tapping into many others to form your own professional approach (Mine is logotherapy, but I do have influences from Jung and Skinner too). But a lot of researchers are just stuck with Freud and his pseudoscientific ideas, going as far as denying that people like us can suffer from a neurological disorder of biological nature, while not contributing with anything to the discussion nor pointing into another direction. It’s called a “psychologism”, aka bringing biological issues to the psychology realm. I can see how my comment before was generalist, and for that I apologize, but we’ve gotta have our definitions straight here.","gvfu88s",1,1619096771,"2021-04-22 13:06:11"

While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

Now, if you're allergic or sensitive to the *inactive* ingredients in one or the other, that's a different story. Another possible explanation is that your gastric pH is higher than normal, causing the delayed-release beads to dissolve at a faster rate than expected, leading to the dose periods overlapping and thus giving you a higher dose than expected.

Only after digging through posts here and linked articles and going down the rabbit hole did I realize that the way I connect to the world is fundamentally different, and so many of my approaches are failed attempts because my entire playbook is disordered.

I finally understand why people seek treatment beyond just the meds. This type of extreme response to obligations and performance describes me to a T. I'm starting therapy next month because I want to be better and I don't want to be chained to this thing I don't understand. 

Not giving myself a pass for all the ways I've fucked up professionally, academically, and personally. But seeing it all as a clear pattern and not just quirky and free-spirited ol' me helps.

"4582","It's not at all uncommon for a variety of medications to need to titrate up pretty frequently in the beginning and then level out. Thyroid meds, for example, pretty frequently work GREAT and level out your thyroid fast--then taper off again, so the first year you often go in very frequently for bloodwork until your body finds a dose that works long-term as well.

There's no real answer to your question, it's individual :/ I also just started on Adderall 10mg IR bid a month ago and just jumped to 20mg bid. I have a follow-up in a month to evaluate where we are there. 

You might need to up your dosage a bunch more times, you might not. You might just need to play with timing, all that good stuff.

What in particular makes you feel like it's not working anymore? I can tell a difference on the higher dose, but it's nowhere near what the first few days ever were like. I read in some book that it's important to remember that meds also change your ""normal""--so if meds bring you to, say, a 6/10 functionwise, whatever that means to you, and you were a 1/10 before, that's going to feel like a HUGE difference. But once you're at 6/10 for a while, it just feels normal, even if it's still a huge improvement, and you're not likely to get to another proportionate increase, if that makes sense.

FWIW, I get much better results taking it on an empty stomach, showering, then eating. If I take my first dose with a full meal, some days it feels like I never took it at all.","d1nbrfm",3,1459628749,"2016-04-02 20:25:49"

It can definitely be a problem. And can be super frustrating when you have no recollection of the alarm even going off and you just wake up and realize that something you didn't consciously do just fucked over your whole day. :/

The best way to get around it really is to get multiple alarms and multiple alarm clocks, keep trying things until you find something that wakes you up, keep changing the sound of the alarm on devices you can (like a phone) so you don't get used to 1 alarm for too long. 

Try and get into the habit of taking your meds if they are stimulants or caffiene or something when the first alarm goes up, that way even if you sleep through the next one you'll be more able to wake up in 20-30 mins when the medications start.

"4667","I've had family and friends that didn't believe I had ADHD or anything else wrong with me. But they were wrong.

If you feel like you need help speak up and self advocate where you can. Find services, school, whoever you can! It's better to get help now rather than later, even if you don't have it specifically, there's nothing wrong with needing help.

Also basically every ADHDer feels like they ""don't have it and am just lazy"". Even after diagnosis many of us feel this way! But usually people are lazy for reason. Not because they just don't want to do stuff. See this opinion piece: https://humanparts.medium.com/laziness-does-not-exist-3af27e312d01

It describes it really well. Even if it isn't ADHD, it doesn't mean there isn't a barrier or that you don't need help! But it could be and it's better to find out sooner rather than later.","ezst2vo",1,1568108148,"2019-09-10 09:35:48"

"4669","Wonderfully accurate and well written, I actually read every word! I'm female, middle class, college educated parents, elementary school in the early/mid 90's. Also, if this matters, and I think it does, I was homeschooled 3rd-6th grades. 

I was diagnosed the summer after my freshman year of college, after earning a 2.4 gpa. I graduated high school Student Body President, VP of National Honor Society, and got a pretty big scholarship for college. I attribute all of this to having very strict parents that were on my ass constantly about school (and work), being naturally intelligent, and having such a busy schedule I had no time to mess up. 

Of course, there were many nights I got no sleep because I had a big report due the next day. I graduated with a 3.5 (non-weighted) cumulative gpa, I worked like crazy to get straight A's in every class, except for math, which I consistently got C's every single quarter, save one or two I got lucky with a B. 

From the time I was 12, I had been seeing a therapist, and was also medicated, for anxiety and depression. Big surprise, right?

My first year at college was a rude awakening. I don't know if I've ever been that depressed in my life, everyone around me was fine, and I was drowning. 

That diagnosis was literally life saving for me. It was ten years ago and I still struggle with my ADHD, but just knowing why I am this way, along with therapy and medication, has truly improved my life. ","cr38whg",20,1431139938,"2015-05-09 02:52:18"
"4670","Thanks so much!

I spoke with her teacher after her lesson today (who also organizes this strings festival for the music federation) and there is an application for special allowances for disabilities, so we’re hoping she’ll be able to use her sheet music and still be able to receive scoring. The kiddo was a little bothered by this — she said she “didn’t want to use her disability.” So, I’m letting her think it over. Her choices are to request the accommodation, keep working on memorization and hope for the best, or go ahead and perform with the book without an accommodation and not be scored. But she admitted she is not enjoying herself working on these pieces. (One is Humoresque, which is one of my favorites, but she rather hates it. It’s a required piece for the festival though.)

But I’m glad to have validation about not memorizing. I want to push that more, for her teacher to go ahead and let her take the play tests without the piece being memorized so we can move on to new skills. (We often waste months on pieces that should pass but fall apart when played without the book.) In school (where she’s a strings major at a performing arts school), she’s never required to memorize, even for the state assessments. It’s all just the local music federation (and if you attend a Suzuki summer camp, performance pieces are supposed to be memorized). I agree, I think it’s time to move past Suzuki (or at least modify it)!

The reason a great many business started and continue to do drug testing is because there are tax incentives that were started under Nixon for promoting a ""drug free workplace"". Higher end business like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs don't drug test and employ a primarily white/middle-class work force that uses drugs at the same rate as the rest of the population. Retail, food service, and hospitality do test and employ a much higher number of low-income and minority populations.

- buy an electric toothbrush, oral B 2000/ or above highly recommended 
- buy toothpaste with or without fluoride, just don’t swallow it

- buy a mouthwash
- buy xylitol guns for in your bag

"4705","The first thing you have to understand about this issue is that ADHD makes it *really hard* to do something you don't want to do and you don't have to do. So the key to success is one of three:

**Make it more attractive, thereby making it something you *want* to do.**

For example:

* I don't like to make food/eat because it's boring and I assume it will be time consuming. But making a Pinterest board of recipe ideas which look extremely delicious is actually helpful, especially if I put a widget on my phone screen so it comes up fairly often and I know that the included recipes aren't insanely complicated. My husband also tends to text me a picture of his lunch to remind me to eat. If you don't have a husband to remind you, I bet there is an app (or you could make an IFTTT recipe or something) that will text or email you a tempting looking picture at a set time each day. You can also use this kind of motivation for other things - pictures of people with the body type you want to achieve for working out? Pictures of delicious looking healthy food to remind yourself it's not all lentils and quinoa? Quotes about the career you really want to remind you to study? Music clips by artists you admire to remind you to practise? ADHD makes it hard to keep long term goals in sight so to keep reminding yourself of them is a useful tool as our brains won't do it automatically.

* Motivate yourself to be early for things by realising that when you're early for something you have time to squeeze in a coffee or a takeaway breakfast or a quick phone game or a walk through the park instead of a bus ride. For bonus effectiveness with this one pick something you can't do at home. (For an at-home version you can pick an activity which you know takes exactly X minutes so if you're ready more than X minutes early you can do it but not if you're later.)

* Figure out if there's anything that goes together that you can specifically not do at other times. For example, I enjoy listening to podcasts, lectures and ted talks, but my focus sucks if I'm sitting at my computer or lying/sitting doing nothing except trying to listen. However, I *can* focus on these things when my hands and eyes are occupied by another task as long as that task doesn't require me to actually think about something. So: Running, ironing, tidying, folding laundry. All perfect examples. I listen to podcasts and audiobooks while doing these things and it then motivates me to do the boring task because it means I get to listen to the next instalment. I listened to Russell Barkley's 2 and 3 hour lectures successfully this way.

* Throw money at unattractive tasks if you have it available. If you struggle with eating, buy nicer food. If you struggle with exercise, get really comfy shoes, and/or a membership to a nice gym or class that you want to go to. If you struggle with going to bed on time, buy an amazing mattress and good quality sheets so that you look forward to bedtime. Buy nice stationery for your work and study. Kit out your workspace so it's pleasant to be in. Etc etc. Equally if you notice that the tools you have for a job are making it even more unappealing (who wants to clean up with crappy appliances which don't work properly?) make those particular tools a priority to replace, and not just with the cheapest thing but with something you'll actually find a pleasure to use even if the task itself doesn't make you jump for joy.

* Routine seems to be a love/hate thing for ADHDers. Some people love a routine and find it comforting to do the same thing at the same time and can build one thing into the routine at a time and have it be successful but for me, I know routine is guaranteed to turn a wanted task into an unwanted one. So part of my strategy for keeping things attractive is to mix them up and avoid a pattern where I do the same thing at the same time when it's self directed.

Second strategy:

**Make it into something you *have to* do**

Be accountable to some external time scale that you don't control:

* Less relevant today with so much on demand stuff, but TV schedules - get yourself addicted to some stupid show which is on 30 minutes before you should ideally leave the house and make sure you're ready before it starts so you can watch it before you leave, knowing you won't have time to get ready after it finishes.

* If you have family members to care for or housemates, coordinate schedules. When my son was at nursery I used to request the early shifts at work because if I walked straight there after dropping him off I'd arrive exactly ten minutes early. Yes it was nice to have time to myself if I had a later start but it was much more efficient to co-ordinate.

* Consider using public transport to get around if you can. When you know if you miss that bus you'll be 30 minutes late rather than 2 minutes, it becomes more important to leave the house on time. (I say ""consider"" because this can be a lot worse for some ADHDers)

* Just avoid having too much free time in the first place. This sounds odd but it works. When you think ""Eh, I can do my laundry any day this week"" or ""Pfft I have two weeks to write that paper"" you won't do it until the last possible minute and then you will hate yourself. When most of your free time is filled up - whatever it is - volunteering, clubs, classes, social engagements - anything which has a *set time* and you feel obligated towards, you'll have a certain amount of time to do what you want in and you'll have to be a lot more conservative with those floating tasks which can be done any time and normally end up getting put off forever. When you know ""I have to do that Tuesday morning or I won't have another chance until next week"", you're more likely to do it. The downside of this is you can end up exhausting yourself, so make sure you strike a balance.

Third and final strategy:

**Make it easier for yourself to do the task**

We've had don't want, we've had don't need, this is just about it being harder for you to do this stuff than it is for other people. So fuck it, make shortcuts. It evens things out a bit.

* Streamline processes. Keep stuff you need for a task really near where the task needs to be done so you can just do it without it being a whole performance of getting things together and then never putting them away again afterwards until they annoy you forever.

* Throw money into labour saving devices, if you have it. If you can automate something, do so. Hell, pay someone else to do it for you if you can!

* Medication can, obviously, help here.

* Work out where the hurdles are for a task. Maybe the trash builds up on your desk because walking across the room to the bin really is just too much effort. So put a small trash bin near your desk. Don't judge yourself or beat yourself up for being lazy. It's not that important - it's fine to have a shortcut. Maybe you don't eat because thinking about what to make is too hard? So write a list of food ideas and have it come up as an alarm on your phone when you want to eat that meal. Maybe getting to the gym feels like too much of an effort - can you do a workout from youtube instead, or arrange to meet a friend once a week to kick a ball around?

* Simplify overcomplicated systems, like paperwork. You only need three categories: Needs action, File, and Shred. (Then file by rough category in a labelled file box). ADHDers can have a tendency to overcomplicate, creating a system so daunting that everything ends up in a giant unsorted pile on the top, which isn't helpful. If you need to find the insurance document it doesn't need to be in a specific pocket for the exact day, month, and location of what it's insuring. It just needs to be in the box called ""Insurance"". When you need it, you'll look through the whole box with no problem. We also have a tendency to be all or nothing so it's like showhome or Hoarders. So instead of arranging your items in a complicated display, buy some of those square ikea shelves with the huge square drawers and just hide stuff in them. It's faster, quicker, and easier, and you don't see the mess. Lose the perfectionism. It's better to do an imperfect job than not to do it at all.

* Over time, build up a framework or template which will allow you to bypass a good chunk of the work of something. This is something I find extremely difficult with ADHD but incredibly, incredibly useful when I do manage to do it. I'd recommend it highly even though it is a ton of work. If you can enlist somebody to help you make the template it can be easier.

* Orient your environment towards the thing you need to do. For example, make your bedroom a relaxing place for sleep. Go out of the house to do tasks like work or studying (a college or public library can be excellent for focus). Remove distractions or temptations, like not having unhealthy food in the house if you want to lose weight.

Lastly. If you keep finding yourself in a cycle where you start something, it goes well, and then slowly tails off without you noticing, just remind yourself that is your ADHD and not *you*, and get back on the horse and start again, from wherever you can even if it's the beginning.

Do not have a talk.  The talks are about the past.  I willing to bet money he is intending to do everything but just gets distracted, overwhelmed, worn down, etc due to the weak and he just can't do it anymore.  Instead have a planning session, where you sit down at a kitchen table and you make a list for both of you with chores.  Then you make little boxes for each day, and then you guys check it off when you complete the boxes.  No chore should take more than 15 minutes.  If it takes more than 15 mins, you need to make multiple boxes for each 15 minutes.

And then you two both do them.  This is cooperation, if one person lets the other down there should be consequences.  Do not make the person feel shitty, but he should do something to make it up for you, and vice versa.

And if you both complete those chores each week.  You spend money to treat yourself on something.  The thing is you need to decide what the treat is at the beginning of the week, not the end, so you can think about it and have the goal motivate you.

And the paper should be visible for all (like the bathroom, or some place you do things multiple times per day and it will be seen.)

Now your job is not to demand him do his job.  It is not to nag him about the chore list, but *gentle reminders* when you think he got stucked in a 2 hour game session, or is hyperfocusing on a distraction is irrelevant.

I was snuck into college after high school to play football and it took me 3 years to finish a 2 year program. I managed to earn a BA but it took me an extra year to complete and I finished with a whopping 2.3 gpa. 

Since my diagnosis and taking prescribed medication at age 30, I've experienced a tremendous amount of self-growth in a relatively short period of time and I a unique understanding of my thought process. 

In 2010 I was accepted to the Master of Education in Counselling Psychology program at the University of New Brunswick on Academic Probation and graduated in 2011 at the top of my class. 

I started Don't dis-my-ability consultation services Inc. in 2014 and I provide Counselling for individuals of all ages. I also provide consulting services in a handful of industries ranging from education to the world of animation.

Since ADHD is diagnosed largely empirically from symptoms, what you describe sounds likely. But it's worth making (more) sure it's not secondary to something else. 

Do make sure you're honest and upfront about any mindset or behavioral struggles you had while still accomplishing famous stuff. It's more easy for gifted people to compensate for ADHD, even to the point of hiding the issue, but the symptom history is still important to establish what's up when that ability to compensate flags later. 

Ditto childhood--if you coasted on tests while not doing homework, like I did, the not doing homework part is very relevant. Don't just write it off as gifted and lazy--you will no doubt have already rationalized most every ADHD-related behavior. ","cnvl7xb",1,1421804997,"2015-01-21 01:49:57"

* When I am really tired, I down a cup of coffee and then take a nap. It kind of resets your brain and you wake up refreshed.

* I have a huge folder of many different types of lists in text files. If something is distracting me, I add it to one of the lists or create a new one. I sometimes even come back to the lists, but most often I do not. Sometimes these lists turn into projects.
* My todo list is more of an aspirational list. It is mostly a ""done"" list of things I do, and then I mark them done. At the top is ""now"" and that is the task I'm working on so I don't forget in the middle of doing it. If I am lucky, sometimes I write a next step or two after the thing under ""now.""
* I schedule days off where I don't take Ritalin and just do whatever crazy thing I want to do and try not to worry if I ever finish it. Nowadays, most of my days are days off and I only have one or two ""productive"" Ritalin days a week. I try to be ok with it.","gfwdc28",3,1608014270,"2020-12-15 06:37:50"

You have to forgive yourself and understand that with ADHD it's p common to fall out of routine no matter how much you try or if you use the same routine. Ngl I still struggle with trying not to beat myself up when I fall out of routine again but I understand if I dwell on it I will feel worse and fall out of routine even more on other things causing more stress.

Make sure you're not overwhelming yourself with tasks. There's nothing wrong with only doing three for the day and you don't need to do all of the things NOW. If you're worried if you put off any tasks, trying doing one small step that makes progress in fulfilling that task by breaking it up.

My job can have me walking through the building a lot so taking 5 minutes to go walk around and clear my head doesn't stand out to anyone.

My job doesn't allow for consistent, structured times like those in the pomodoro technique. However, I've been trying to loosely apply the same concept whenever I can. It definitely helps me recharge a little during the workday. Since I frequently have to go into ""customer service mode"" at work despite being an introvert (and you probably wouldn't think I am when I'm  helping a ""customer"") those brief breaks can make all the difference.

Medication helps to some extent. Getting good sleep, too. Also, if you do any reading online, then you might find Beeline Reader helpful; it basically highlights text in such a way that it's easier to track from line to line. It costs money, but I just use the trial version. 

Using physical highlighters is helpful with paper to me. For PDFs, I also find highlighting helpful. Mendeley is useful for this, because there's something like 7 highlight colours, and you can overlap highlights several times for darker colours. 

To be honest, I only use a vague colour code system when highlighting; I mostly do it just to visually separate ideas. As a result, all my academic reading PDFs have basically every line highlighted. My non-ADHD colleagues say it gives them a headache to look at, but it works for me.

"4803","I think you might have conflated two things -- you can go to arts school and be creative and still take your medication.

University is a hard time for people with ADHD. 

When I was in school (I'm 36 now) and unmedicated I alternated between being on the dean's list for academic excellence (when I was interested in the material) and then failing out because I couldn't be bothered with schoolwork.

I think you should see what art school is like with medication and without. You can use it when you want it, and leave it behind. It's not ""cheating.""

Having been through theatre school and school for audio production (and also Cognitive Science), I think that being an artist requires times when you want to be inspired and creative and wild, and then time when you choose one of those wild, creative ideas and put hard, focused work into bringing that idea to life.

You may find that unmedicated you excel at the first part, but struggle with the second. In those cases, be open to the idea of trying medication to help you get through those times when you need to bring focused effort to refine the idea.

As a professional artist, you'll find a huge part of your life is grant applications, and even neurotypical people find the process exhausting and boring. So as an ADHD person that's somewhere where you may want to lean on the support available in medication.

I said it in my other post: you don't need to always take ADHD meds for them to be effective -- you can just take them when you need them. 

It's great that you're finding a path that rewards and celebrates the ADHD-ness (quick thinking, creativity, lateral-thinking, expressiveness) but the practice of being an artist is, like all things, a lot of work, and there will be parts you'll need the more 'normal' skills for.

I jsut worry that you're setting up the ADHD meds as being representative of this other, boring life that you don't want. And so when you need them again you'll not take advantage of the because you'll feel like you're selling yourself out.

Really -- it's the same you on meds, and off. And you can take meds and go to a school you want or not take meds and go to the school you want. You can be creative with meds, and creative without meds.

You are the one who directs your life, not the medication. And It sounds like you've made a great decision to follow your passion, but taking or not taking meds didn't do that, you did! You are making that decision, and you can pursue any path you want in life with or without the meds.

It's not like you have to ""Be Medicated"" or ""Be Unmedicated.""

You have two options in every moment for the rest of your life:

You have access to this creative, interested, fluid, unmedicated ADHD brain AND you have access to a steady, focused, driven medicated ADHD brain to pick from on a moment-to-moment basis.

So make the choice when and where it makes sense. Find a balance between medicated and unmedicated that works for you. And enjoy your awesome new path! :D  ","dci804d",1,1484591035,"2017-01-16 18:23:55"

In fact, a lot of philosophical questions lack meaning to me, like ""what's the meaning of life?"" (life isn't a puzzle) or ""is there an afterlife?"" or something like that.  I just don't think of the world in those terms, so I can't really engage with questions like that.

It's true, I suppose, that the vast majority of my ideas come from Dharmic or Chinese religions and philosophies.  /u/Wattsist is my account for talking about them, but I never really figured it was related to my ADHD...  However, the other people I have known very well who have ADHD have been either hardline atheists or else Buddhists of some stripe or another.

"4821","I'm sorry to hear that, I've had a similar experience. Aviation has always been a hobby of mine and I enjoy flight simulators(mainly X Plane 11 and IL-2 Sturmovik), but have considered getting my PPL and possibly an IFR rating over the last few months. I take Adderall and recently learned that it would disqualify me from getting a Third Class Medical Certificate that the FAA requires to fly.  I highly doubt my ADHD medication or lack of would impair my ability to safely/efficiently operate an aircraft.

The diagnosis of ADHD itself won't disqualify you, but the medication used to treat it will. The FAA does make an exception that if you don't use any disqualifying medication for at least 90 days, you can apply for a medical certificate. The issue with that is you can't get a prescription again and are forced to stay off the medication for however long your medical certificate or pilots license is valid. 

Sorry for the rant, but I doubt any employer in a aerospace or aviation related field would turn someone down for an ADHD diagnosis. It would probably be ruled as discrimination if they did reject you because of ADHD or your Concerta medication.

I hope everything works out and you keep pursuing your passions.

"4835","Ok, Cubs and baseball may be a bit much for him. I think that you should talk to him about why he feels that way first before he goes to the activities, as if he is having a bad day, receiving more stimulation from the activities may cause him to stress out and have an outburst.

Another thing that you can do is talk to the people in charge of Cubs and baseball, and ask them to keep and eye on him, so if they see that he is becoming aggravated, they can help him cool down, that being going to a separate area with a cub leader or baseball coach so that he can calm down and if he feels that he needs to, talk to the person about how he is feeling, as a form of moral support. 

If he really enjoys Cubs and baseball, I wouldn't want him to have to give up on what he loves, so I would talk to the leaders of the activities, firstly so they know what is going on, and how to spot if he is getting overwhelmed, and most importantly, so they know how to help him.

I don't know if the Adderall was the cause, but I switched to Vyvanse and immediately saw results. I'm less bitchy, intense, anxious and able to enjoy life when I'm not working on a task.

"4842","I was diagnosed with bulimia before I was diagnosed/medicated for ADHD. I had always had trouble with self-control, because my decision-making process took about three seconds, and I think I binge ate, in part, due to my dissatisfaction with myself and my frustration with my inability to ""be successful"" (I had just finished my freshman year of high school, and could no longer skate by with mostly B's and some A's in the honors classes; my GPA was a 2.0). My mom didn't believe in ADHD--she thought I was lazy and was only pursuing a diagnosis so I could get a ""magic pill"" that would get me good grades with as little effort as possible--and I just didn't understand why everyone could buckle down and ""control"" their ability to focus when they needed to and I couldn't, especially since I *love* learning. 

You can imagine how well ""control"" and eating disorders go together. I was diagnosed with ADHD a couple months after my BN diagnosis and subsequently was properly medicated. My life changed so much; I'm *not* just a lazy piece of shit ultimately incapable of amounting to anything because of some inherent, unfixable flaw. I'm actually really smart. My mother has since come around: she has apologized for the way she approached ADHD and completely agrees that I *do* have it and she was in the wrong, but I'm an emotionally fragile person and the damage was already done.

Six years later, my bulimia has turned into anorexia in part due to repressed childhood trauma. However, I still think my mother's dismissal of my concerns about ADHD for years play into my low self-worth and inability to validate myself. 

My emotional and physical health may be destroyed, but at least I can find solace in academia now that I'm on meds, I guess.","co9uuyu",1,1422977707,"2015-02-03 15:35:07"

"4851","The best thing you can possibly do for your exams is to be well-rested beforehand. Set a bedtime and get there each night, even if you feel like you have a million things to do, and even if you have to read for half an hour before you're tired enough to fall asleep. Make your to-do list for the next day, put down your tasks, and go to bed. Early too. I forget where I read it, but your brain performs different functions at different times during the night and getting early (before midnight) vs late sleep (only sleeping after midnight-ish) has very different effects. So don't wait till midnight and sleep till 8am, because you're not allowing your brain to achieve everything it needs to do. I have a hard time getting to bed on time so I have to set my alarm clock for evenings as well, to remind me. Try that!


Also, and slightly unrelated to adhd, have you ever tried massage therapy? As someone who carries a lot of stress tension and ends up with shoulder and back problems, I can not encourage this enough. You might even find a school where students offer clinics at deeply discounted prices (I go to the school here where an hour long massage is $25, and they're usually quite good). It feels like the entire world is just a little bit lighter and so much easier to manage when you don't have these awful knots and pains.

I’m not able to pinpoint exactly what “causes” a good day or bad day, unfortunately that isn’t really how ADHD works. With that being said, I do try to stay conscious of internal and external influences on my behavior and state of mind. Some of these influences include hormones, my sleep routine, nutrition, and stress. I’m sure there are more I can’t think of at the moment.

The proper dosing procedure is titration, which is a bi-weekly or monthly increase of dose, until you either find one that's effective, or until the side effects get too bad. Then you change medications. Rinse and repeat until you either find something that works, or exhaust your options. Low doses often don't have much effect; instead, they're useful for making sure that you don't have any significant negative reactions (such as an allergy or induction of heart issues or psychosis).","cxtvdpw",1,1449731753,"2015-12-10 07:15:53"

I began stumbling through life completely lost with PTSD and Anxiety disorder. Suicidal was an understatement, but that was what caused part of my PTSD. Long long horrible story.

Anyway, my point is I was beyond my years in intelligence and could not enjoy anything. I would think it through to the end and would always say. What's the point of doing that? I know what the end result is. 

Always saw the future before most, due too high functioning forward thinking out of the box. Labeled talented and gifted at 11 and put in special classes. That isolated me because it was the rich kids in the class and I was just a poor kid from the streets.

Enough rambling and comma's, lmao, haha,,. 

Your point is we can't execute our intelligence. I used to be able to. Now at 50ish. I was diagnosed with ADHD and I looked back and said. Jesus that's what's been wrong the whole time!

So after all these years of thinking i was a complete Nut case. I truly just couldn't get the fuck out of my own way!

Executive function disorder. Can't make a damn decision over White bread or wheat. Stand staring at shit and feel paralyzed on how or what decisions to make.

Absolutely horrible knowing what to do and can't. Like if the house was on fire I know to get out but need to wait until I have it all figured out first. What the what? 

Hang in there and yes that's alot of rambling and words, 🤣🤣😉😉😉","gss66gw",1,1617095011,"2021-03-30 09:03:31"

I paid out of pocket to go to an ADHD specialist and it has still taken over a year to get anywhere. It's actually painful to see people in this sub talking about getting their diagnosis and being put on meds :( 

I had cognitive tests from my childhood, a letter from my therapist, supporting evidence from my friends and family, a super in depth self-interview, and an in-person assessment and was told that although I was almost certainly ADHD, I still needed more ""evidence from my childhood"" because that's part of the DSM criteria. It was pretty soul crushing since most of my childhood records are lost and I did very well in school so it would be difficult to find something to support me. 

I did manage to pull up a couple childhood report cards and submit them, so I'm waiting to hear back from the psychiatrist now. I'm determined to get this diagnosis whether it's with him or someone else, but I can't stomach having to wait another year and spend another grand.","fzgz0qs",1,1595902128,"2020-07-28 02:08:48"

"4916","Okay so this might get a little long but I'll try to keep it short:
As a child I had too much energy so my parents made me do lots of sports which I enjoyed... But I had even more energy afterwards.
So in school I stopped duing sports for a few years because I didn't have the time. My grades got better but I constantly fell asleep during classes. His state kept on until this year when I got diagnosed, which helped me be nore aware of myself. I started doing sports again and boom energy is back.
I train with my boyfriend who is incredibly strong and has so much self control. But even after training, when I feel my muscles get exhausted (which hasn't ever happened until I started training with him) I STILL have energy left. I often get even more energetic from training and my friends I train with are jealous. What they don't understand though is that my body is just really good at using absolutely all of it's recourses. I'm bad at controlling how much force I put into things and I've regularly broken things, and sadly even people, during training as a child. I've learnes never to put in all my force as it often hurts someone or breaks something. So if I'm forced to actually go to my limit I will just... Break. I've basically dragged myself back to my car and sat there for an hour on my phone because I couldn't feel my legs and therefore couldn't drive.
Energy management can be really complicated for people with adhd and I advice finding a friend to train with. Someone who starts at the same level as you, so you have an orientation when to stop pushing yourself. Don't go too far. But if you're really powered out, it's often easiest to do mental exercises for me, because my body is tired. If I listen to educational podcasts during training it's also very easy to listen because my body is busy and that helps my brain concentrate. Idk if you can take anything from this. I hope it somehow helped","fzhvt42",5,1595927894,"2020-07-28 09:18:14"
"4917","Ok this is going to be LONG but hopefully it will give you a good example of someone with few childhood symptoms but  adulthood adhd problems.

First, i would consider finding another doc that is more informed in current research. However I'm not a doc so take this with a grain of salt haha. I've been drowning myself in adhd info lately so I'm just going to share what I've learned. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

 It's easy to miss adhd in girls, especially if they have the predominantly inattentive type and not the hyperactive type (your description of yourself in school and now sound spot on). Also, your responsibilities change as you get older and become an adult so things may have been easier to handle as a kid but are more difficult now that you're hit with a million new responsibilities like work, Bills, feeding yourself, all that extra bullshit. ALSO your home and family environment can play a big role in how your symptoms manifest as a child depending on the level of support and stuff that you receive. 

STOP HERE and go to the last paragraph if you dont want to hear about how I didn't have a problem growing up but now can barely function at 32.

I'm 32 m and I didn't have any severe trouble until I was 25 and about halfway through grad school. Looking back I had a lot of the symptoms of the inattentive adhd type, not hyperactive, but no one noticed because I had great behavior and crushed it in school. I also came from a family of teachers that taught in all the schools in town so I received excellent support and was expected to behave well and do well in school. I did everything last minute and got by no problem by doing and memorizing things the night before (the adrenaline rush from procrastinating can fuel your brain and resolve your adhd attention issues temporarily). I made it through college living at home under the condition that if I did well I could stay at home pretty much for free. Great deal. So I did that. But I moved out halfway through my masters program and everything grinded to a halt. I ghosted my grad program for 3 years because I couldn't put together a 30 page double spaced thesis (WTF!) and came back to finish the semester right before all my credits would  expire. It's been 4 years, I've had 3 jobs in my field, each a step up, but the struggle is so real and I feel like I'm barely holding on. I'm able to progress because I'm always willing to help others with projects and i have a great attitude. 

I have a great wellness doctor and a few months ago I mentioned my problems to her and she instantly said, no that cant be adhd. You would have known as a kid and had a ton of problems in school but you didn't have any of that. A couple months later I went to establish care with a new primary care provider recently and she just happened to ask questions that led me to talk about my attention issues and she just explained me like she'd known me forever, she totally understood. She also asked if I was anxious or depressed. I told her I was anxious and sometimes felt a little depressed but it all seemed situational and not like my baseline level of being, to which she explained that those can basically be side effects of adhd and the associated difficulties, which is exactly how I feel. I'm moving forward with her to try and figure this thing out, but I've had a hard time not doubting myself since I dont fit the mold of the kid with adhd, but I definitely fit the mold of an adult with it.

So i guess, you should learn as much as you can about yourself and adhd and find a doctor that understands adhd and the current research, and dont doubt yourself.  Check out the ADHD Experts Podcast and scroll through the episodes and listen to anything that has female or adult diagnosis in the title. Its eye opening.

Maybe it's not a great outcome so far but God dammit you're managing all this stuff and still will come and post to listen to us babble something you kinda knew would potentially be negative.

I say well done. Take what you think is useful. Challenge yourself to also consider the stuff you want to dismiss or call stupid. 

At the end of the day, you will choose if you WANT to continue being their mum or not. And if the answer is yes, there's a lot in these replies already that can help. Challenge yourself to think differently. What if some of this is true. What if I did it differently. What if I said it differently. I know you're probably thinking ""what if any of you came to spend a week in my shoes and see how you do?"". I know I'd hang myself, and I don't have the skills or emotional intelligence to handle what you deal with. So if I had to take your place, I'll bring my sisters and wifey and Bros in law with me. I'd surround myself with an army of people I know are better than me. More patient, and just fun to be around. 

Maybe you can build your own army. Maybe get together with other parents and see if some can come home have a cup of tea in the middle of your most dreaded chaotic moment of the day. See what they say, how they react. 

Basically do what you're doing here, but with people face to face. See what happens when you go talk to others, maybe specialists or maybe just experienced parents like you. And stick to it until you start finding solutions. You're gonna get there, stick to it, keep looking, keep thinking differently and look for ideas - forget judgments or impulses to give everything and everyone a big middle finger - just think of finding new ideas and challenge your brain to accept what you'd normally reject.

As for the content of the daydreams, sometimes I imagine supernatural worlds, sometimes I imagine real life scenarios, I sometimes daydream that I'm giving an interview or a speech about something that interests me or something I experienced. I tended to do the supernatural world stuff when I was a kid more than now. However, even in the same daydreaming session I might daydream several different 'things' and often jump from one thing to another. I never complete stories. More often than not I daydream some interaction and then repeat in my head over and over. 

I don't know if some of this even classifies as daydreaming as much as my brain is just constantly spewing thoughts and I have to pace in order to get my energy out.

Another piece of advice I can offer that I learned from a wise woman is NEVER let someone else complete you.

"4987","I recently decided to get off medicine and have been working with a psychologist on this transition. This seriously has been our number one topic and my number one reason for breaking down into tears in her office.

When I was younger, I’d always test into honors classes but was an awful student. I just assumed I was an idiot, but really, I just didn’t know how to study because I didn’t know I had ADHD. I’ve always been socially awkward and, especially during puberty, was very impulsive. As a result, several of my friends used to anticipate some of the ridiculous things I’d say or do. All this, of course, had a major impact on my self esteem. And once I got diagnosed and on medicine, I finally felt like I was a productive member of society.

I know I’m not an idiot. In fact, I’m regularly told how smart I am and how good I am at my job (partially due to overcompensating to prove to myself that I am capable). But remembering how I was perceived, by both others and myself, led to my bigger fears of not being able to operate at the same level once off medicine.

"5001","For me, other people in the house are just another source of stimulation that distracts me from what I should be doing. I don't mean a physical distraction, like making noise (well, sometimes lol), but just the thought that there's a new source of dopamine sitting across the room at any given time is pretty deterrent. Especially since that little voice that usually screams at you to stop procrastinating tends to be much quieter when you're procrastinating with someone else. 

The only time I can get stuff done with someone else is if we're both determined to be productive. So if I go study with my girlfriend, even when we're studying opposite things, it's almost like she's ""off limits"" since I know she's busy. This also helps keep me on track because her productivity motivates me to be productive, whereas my roommmates' laziness contributes to my laziness.  

As far as advice, one thing that worked for me is creating a type of Do Not Disturb signal for other people. It took a little while for my roommates to pick up on this, but when I'm studying in my room I burn a candle. Aside from masking my man smells and calming me, it has the added effect of permeating through the house so that my buddies know as soon as they walk in that I'm busy. Knowing that they know not to disturb me, I'm less likely to worry about it or to engage them, lest they think I'm not actually doing anything. ","d0zhfiz",3,1457973385,"2016-03-14 16:36:25"

"5007","What you're feeling right now we have all felt.  Living with ADHD is living life on the highest difficulty setting.  It can really suck.  


But plenty of us have also found ways to be successful.  So keep that in mind. Growth Mindset.  Things can get better.

Next, drastic doesn't work.  It never has, it never will.  Every last one of us has said *Today I am turning over a new leaf and I will now never procrastinate nor be distracted ever again! Huzzah!*

And 15 minutes, 2 hours, or maybe even 2 weeks later you're right back where you were.  Because with ADHD, novelty gives you a little hit of adrenaline, a little hit of dopamine and you can focus but once the novelty wears off, you're where you were.  No further.

Step 1, believe it's possible for things to be better than they are now.  

Step 2 is find something small that can make things better that you can stick with.

It sounds like your phone is a particular problem for you?

Start building up phone free time.  

This isn't easy - the phones are designed to be absolutely everything you need.  The greatest minds of my generation are dedicated to keeping us addicted to our phones - and like problem gamblers, we're helpless.

But pick one task, one thing, one time of day where *No Phones Allowed.* Write it down.   Put it some place you can see. 

Make sure you can't see your phone while you're in *No Phones* time.  Maybe instead of charging it next to your bed, charge it in the bathroom or the kitchen.  Put it in a drawer.  

Your step 2 doesn't have to be the thing I suggested.  It can be anything that's small. 

I took up a bullet journal.  I started writing in it every morning.  A month later I started writing in it morning and evening.  I put up routines around my desk at work.  I added walking at lunch - not every day, but most days and I wrote down when I did it.  I started marking which days I skipped having any soda at all so I knew ""Crap, I've had soda every day this week, I think I'll skip it today"" or ""I've had a good run of soda free days, I can have one today"" without going on a coca cola bender which is what I used to do.

Small changes are sustainable.  Big ones aren't.

I bet this wasn't very satisfying to hear, though - where you're at right now is a state of psychic pain.  I feel that.  I'm really sorry.  It can get better and it will get better.  We'll be here to help.","f0po09d",1,1568839291,"2019-09-18 20:41:31"

If you have a problem with not wanting to check it when you remember/the app alerts you, there are options where you can basically ""snooze"" the reminder to alert you again at a later time.

"5028","**Technology** - I just ""know"" how to do things.  It drives people I know crazy. If it's something I've never dealt with before, I just intuitively know how to use it.  If it IS something I've used before, I can guide people through something without even needing to be looking at it myself.

**Observation** - I am much more observant about everything when I'm not on medication.  I notice EVERYTHING.  ""Oh, why is that mark on the ceiling.  It wasn't there yesterday.""

**Multiple Conversations** - I can maintain and follow two conversations at once.  I can be talking on the phone with one person, and talking in person to someone else.  One of the biggest drawbacks to medication is that I can NOT do this when medicated.  It drives me crazy, because I'm so used to it I keep trying it (and get burned) when on medication.

**Getting around doing things** - I can find loopholes and ways around almost anything.  Maybe I should've been a lawyer.  In high school, I had teachers (like history) that would write a bunch of things on the board and we'd need to write down and define them all for a test/quiz.  So I figured out that if you wrote down a term, and then did not define it, you would get points taken off.  HOWEVER, if you simply do not write down a term you do not know, the teacher doesn't realize it isn't there, and points are not deducted for an incorrect answer (because the teachers would just deduct points for wrong answers, not award points for correct answers).  

And just to clear up a misconception about ADHD - It's not PROCRASTINATION, it's PRIORITIZATION.","c601gye",5,1346175652,"2012-08-28 17:40:52"
"5029","Hahah, well, here's my advice: 

Go in with an open mind, BUT START SLOW. First impressions are super duper important and can shape the way you perceive driving for the next long while. I started in an empty parking lot but moved on too fast and I think that made me overly anxious about driving. I'd recommend starting in an empty parking lot, and only moving on when you're confident. Take your time. Don't let your ""elder person in the car"" rush you. 

If you have multiple vehicles, learn the ins and outs of ONE car, i.e. make that your training car. In the beginning, you might not even understand how to turn left/right, let alone parking between the two yellow lines (which was hardest thing for me for a long time lol). But when you get used to your car's size, mirror positions, seating position, and even the ""weight"" of the car, you'll pick it all up in no time.

Personal opinion - I think the supplement manufacturers could be cultivating a mild dependence by blowing out the dose like that. I already make some melatonin naturally. I probably shouldn't be getting massive doses of a essential chemical which greatly exceed what my brain makes and needs.

Every symptom I read about is somewhat relevant to me and who I've always been. Now I don't know who's convincing who. Me telling my doc I have adhd and can't pay attention or her telling me that I do (she's so damn convincing) so she collects her insurance money from seeing me each month. Either way, I get shit loads of work done for the first time ever. Am insanely happier and feel optimistic about my future. ","cw3moua",3,1445137836,"2015-10-18 03:10:36"

However it's definitely way worse when I'm tired and the meds have worn off. And I can't always control speaking without thinking. People don't appreciate how difficult it is sometimes to get the right words when you need them.

Its hard because I feel like there is something wrong with me if I talk to them about it and then I worry that they think I'm not capable of doing my job.

All the rest of my apps are on my iPhone but might be available on Android:

Akiva; an app to make routines. I have ""morning"", ""evening/shower"" and ""evening/no shower"". It means I don't forget part of my routine since it tells you what to do once you've completed the task, and I don't have as many issues moving on to the next thing since it's clearly stated for me what to do next. I think you can make two or three for free and then pay like $3 for unlimited (which I like since I'll sometimes make one throughout the week of stuff I need to do over the weekend, which I just turn on once I take my meds on my day off)

Due; a reminders app that will re-remind you after every X minutes. I have mine set for 15. I use it for stuff that's important but that I don't need to do quite yet, and for weekly reminders (sort meds, etc), and I have a daily one that reminds me it's time to wind down. The app won't stop reminding you until you ""snooze"" or mark it done which helps me a lot. 

Round; medication tracker. You can put in what meds you take and when. It'll send you a reminder when it's time to take them, a reminder a few hours later to ask if you took them, and the little notification icon stays until you take your meds (which has reminded me several times on days I left them at home and then checked my phone walking through the door). You can put in as needed meds, too. There's also a calendar that shows you days you've missed your meds (more helpful for my antidepressants since those I really do need to take daily). 

I use the timer app a lot to put a limit on ""just got home and need to unwind"" time, and set alarms daily for when I need to leave for work / a ten minute warning alarm for that too. And alarms if I have a big chunk of time before I have to leave so I know that I can hyperfocus and not constantly worry about time. ","e03a66k",4,1528119293,"2018-06-04 13:34:53"

"5129","Here are some strategies I use to make studies look less intimidating/overwhelming:

1) Take a day or two to get everything organized. Since this is extra important I will get into details below.

2) I often separate the links (drives, docs, classes, videos, etc) in folders on the favorites menu (ex: Favorites&gt;University&gt;2nd semester&gt;Classes&gt;Chemistry&gt;1st test). It's possible to use for as many other interest you have as well, just try to keep things intuitive and leave everything the as categorized as possible, just like in the example.

3) Create a Google Drive where you can put everything. This Drive will be used for SCHOOL PURPOSES ONLY, otherwise you'll lose other thing there or lose your important materials on another Drive/Folder. Keep things intuitive and categorize as much as possible. Now add this drive to the favorites bar, where you can find it easily later.

4) Find old tests, exercise lists, pdfs, books, videos, WhatsApp groups and other kinds of materials you like to use when studying. Then organize these on the Drive you just created.

3) Now save the documents you found on your desktop so you don't miss anything in case internet fails you.

**#4** *Give them an out* (in other words your exit plan), while continuing the attack you say maybe they are really a horrible person, but *instead made a simple error*, they did not think about the situation, or realize they did not know you, and thus resorted to sterotype.  Regardless **now transitioning back to #3** a moral person will realize they are being an ass and will apologize or back down, only an immoral person will continue to attack, now you ask them the question.

**#5** You ask them the question **Which are you?** and you drop it.

----

Pretty much what you do is you first agree with them create sympathy for a few seconds, and then when they least expect you turn it around an go **mean girl on them** (even if you are a guy).

Doing it in this way is a way of showing them that you are capable of being defensive and offensive, but you will only continue to be offensive and risk them verbal, physical, or social pain if they continue to press the attack.  This is why its very important to give them an out and not to beat them into submission, just show they are wrong, make them defensive, and show them they only have to be defensive if they continue to act the bully.

Do it correctly and in almost all cases they will back down.  This is because if you do it correctly, the *fast* instinctual brain will take over, they are hearing your words, but they are not processing them and all their nuances, instead they are only seeing emotions and thus the automatic fast brain takes over for the slow cognitive brain is too slow to react. In effect you are going to ""trigger the avoid social shame"" autopilot.

Now this tactic will not work *if the person has no shame or is oblivious to consequences.*  But this is not very common for even sociopaths who are very hard or impossible to feel shame in themselves, do recognize the concept of social shame and thus will not invite themselves into uncertain stupid situations.","criv7fj",3,1432425746,"2015-05-24 00:02:26"

So I don't know if it's just me or what but I'm terrible with keeping up with friendships/relationships. Like sometimes I'll just forget about people and forget to message them for days/weeks at a time. Maybe it's just the fact I have some shitty friends, but I don't know for sure.  Anyway, I have one friend that constantly texts/messages me as much as I message them just to see how they're doing and to keep up with what's going on. He's about the only person I give a shit about friends-wise and what happens to him.  With all my other ""friends,"" I have to send the message first to establish contact as well as make plans. They almost never text me unless it's convenient to them.  If they aren't making an effort to make contact with me first at all whatsoever should I even bother trying to be ""friends"" with them?

"5154","Hello, friend! First of all, it may help to take a few moments of mindfulness, focusing on your breathing and maybe even taking a short nap if you need it. It may also help to recognize that we're collectively going through one of the most turbulent times in modern history, which may be making it more difficult than ever to concentrate (it certainly has for me).

A missed deadline or two doesn't mean you've failed. People miss deadlines all the time and in the vast majority of cases, everything is still okay in the end. It may help you to try to better understand why you're missing these deadlines. Is the subject matter really boring? Are you in a headspace that makes it hard to write? Are you burned out? Is it possible the assignment is much tougher than expected and the pay doesn't reflect the effort? Perhaps your client hasn't been holding you accountable in the past, so it's tough to feel as though you're accountable to their current commitments.

It may also help you to understand how urgent the deadline is on the client's side. Do you have this information? I can tell you there's a big difference in my own motivation if there's an entire office waiting on me to submit something to go to print than if I'm writing for a site with an editorial backlog and my piece won't see the light of day for weeks anyway.

Then, it's important to address two separate issues: 1. Notifying your clients about the status of the piece and 2. Completing the actual piece.

For the first challenge, it may be worthwhile to reach out to them again — especially if you have a strong relationship with them.:""Despite my best efforts, due to a heavy workload, I have been unable to complete this within the extended timeframe. Would you be open to extending it further, or would you like you reassign the piece?"" It's often also helpful to let them know the status of the assignment. For instance, if you're almost done but just need to do some editing, this is a solid case for them to give you more time.

If you've decided you'd feel better if the client lifted the burden from you entirely, you may just wish to admit that you're not in a position to complete it at this time.

For the one that's coming up, you can preemptively let the client know you have a heavy workload and ask if they would be open to an extension. I obviously don't know the specifics of the situation, but they may simply say something like, ""It's not urgent, take another couple of weeks if you need it."" However, if it is urgent, keep this in mind as you move to the second challenge.

Taken together, these things should alleviate some of the anxiety and guilt that comes with missing a deadline.

As far as the second challenge, you may need a strategy for getting the work done. As I mentioned previously, it helps to understand what's blocking you.

The first thing you want to do is, based on your clients' responses, prioritize the pieces.

Then, it's a matter of setting aside distraction-free time to complete them. Depending on your work style, you may need to install tools that block certain websites during specific hours of the day, though I know that modern journalism isn't particularly conducive to this method. You may also need to try to find a distraction-free place to work.

Another thing I recommend is practicing a Pomodoro method. This means setting a timer and doing focused work for that amount of time, almost as though it's a race with yourself. I usually work in 20-minute intervals and then take 10-minute breaks.

Further, if you don't have a set writing schedule, I encourage you to set one and do your best to stick with it as it will become a habit over time.

If you have ample time and you're still unable to do it, there may be some kind of loss of interest in the subject matter there. This is a tough one and when I find myself in this situation, I typically will do my best to finish the piece and then turn down that type of work in the future while searching for clients whose work is more in line with my interests. It's not ideal, but over time, I've discovered it's not worth it in the long term to stress out over this type of work so I simply have to avoid it.

I hope this helps. Good luck!

In my opinion you should try to think of this like this: every one else were born with the pills inside of them in a matter of speech, before you started taking you were walking around on ""hard"" mode, you couldn't do, or not as easily or well as other people naturally could.

The pills, if you really have ADHD, just helps you achieve what you could have achieved if never had ADHD to begin with, it takes the extra weight off your back.

To conclude I think there aren't two different people or personality, the pills doesn't give you anything you couldn't achieve before if you tried hard enough for enough time, it just makes it easier.

Just I get a whole lot of Autism Moms in my inbox - the type who think well, my kid can’t talk so his life is worthless and he’ll be a burden on me until I die. (The number of autistic kids and adults who are killed by their parents and caregivers because of that type of attitude would no doubt disgust you.) And then when I try to tell them that their kids may surprise them, that some of the most intelligent and erudite people I’ve ever met “speak” via typing, they tell me I’m “high functioning and don’t understand” (I do) or I’m simply “not like their child” (when I was largely nonverbal until age 9 or so). 

Anyway. The phrase I’ve seen used that most agrees with me personally is “needs more support” or “needs less support” because it’s just a truth, if that makes sense. I need very little support most days - I can speak, drive, hold a conversation, etc - but it doesn’t mean I don’t have “low functioning” days, where every little thing sets me off and I’m largely mute. The difference is that I know how to handle these days - so I still don’t need much support. Does that make sense? Phrasing it more as what someone needs and less as some inherent characteristic is always generally better, because with the right supports, autistic people can live great lives, or at least lives where we can do more things for ourselves and need less help - but it’s a question of the supports we get, rather than the inherent flaws or strengths. Like, if there’s a Japanese person, and they don’t speak English, you don’t say they’re low functioning Japanese. You say they need help speaking English and give them lessons.

I don’t blame my neurologist for not ruling out the pill wasn’t working anymore since I didn’t completely understand what was going on but THANK GOD I found someone new because we got to the root of the issue. Now I’m taking Vyvanse and it’s so much better for me.

I don't know *how to be in the world.* It is partly my ADHD-PDD-NOS combination. In autistic people some thing can never be changed. My shrink once told me the anxiety I always have might never go away. This is what autism is to me the most, the ever-present anxieties. 

My main issue, well, one of them anyway, is that I can't get into routine. I have no motivation. Maybe if I had a coach present on a daily basis... but that isn't feasible. Anxiety+ dysmotivation + childhood trauma + dysroutine = kill me now. I don't know what to do. I have found no approach or method. I am well passed 40 now.

I can't even maintain a hobby. It is like, am I really this broken? It is like an awakening. When I did not have my dx's, I could maintain some sort of illusion of 'Yes I know something isn't right but let's just push it away as much as possible'. 

People say we have to find our personal way or method. I haven't found anything so far and the years are slipping away fast.

"5239","Well, I'm 39 and in the US, so I'm more or less in the same boat. I just started meds (30mg Vyvanse) about 2 and a half weeks ago, and so far the experience has been 100% positive.

As an example, I have always made plans, and then sucked at actually following through with them. I make a 30 day plan, trying to keep my expectations reasonable about what I could get done in a  day. So, piano and workout in the morning, some self-enrichment during lunch, and working on personal projects after work. First day, I would get most or all of my tasks done. The next day, maybe half. The next day, maybe one. And then the plan would get abandoned until I came up with a new one, sure I could get it all done *this time*. This is basically the story of my life since high school.

By comparison, in the two and half weeks since I started medication I've gotten every single item done, every single day. The only side effect I had was some light-headedness if I was also consuming something with caffeine, but I've been wanting to quit caffeinated beverages for a while, so I quit and haven't looked back. Obviously side effects vary from person to person, so I'd say I got lucky there.

The thing that surprised me most is that I don't really feel any different. I don't feel jittery or amped up, I don't feel high or zoned out. The only real change I've seen is in the results. I'm occasionally tempted to do things that used to eat up my time before (Netflix, Youtube, whatever), but now I'm able to steer myself back to what I know I should be working on. The way I think of it is that my brain actually treats my priorities as *priorities* now. It moves the stuff I think is important to the top of the list, rather than just shuffling them in at random, shoved between the time-wasters and idle interests.

Anyway, this all just my subjective experience, but I really feel like seeking out a diagnosis has put me on a much better path in life, and if you think you might benefit from it, I would personally recommend getting some answers.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as ""excuses"" go, there are a lot of things that I look back on now, where if I had been diagnosed younger it might have made a real difference. But you just have to ignore that. What's done is done, for whatever reason. The best you can do is put yourself in position to not repeat the same mistakes.","eiwtpau",1,1553031608,"2019-03-19 21:40:08"

"5241","For me, caffeine brings back the effect of amphetamines as they wane away... so I administer 40mg dextroamphetamine, it gives me 8 hours primary effects (psychostiulation - desire to work, energy etc.), then I feel them for another4-6 hours but become wishy-washy, won't work, don't feel driven etc. 8am dose, 4pm wane... if i have a coffee at 4pm, the primary effects return for a further 8 hours (!). It doesn't feel like coffee, it feels like 40mg d-amph (!). I call it 're-invoking the dragon', as, well... that's kind of what it is :D . after the 8 hours return of the amphetamines comes the wishy-washy 4-6 hours, during which i can't sleep. So... 8am dose, 4pm coffee, primary effects until midnight, then can't sleep until 6am. not good. The body only excretes amphetamines through the urine when the blood is acidic. Vitamin C makes the blood acidic and is a diuretic (makes you urinate). Cranberry is a powerful diuretic. Take 500mg vitaminc c and a 120mg cranberry extract tablet no later than 9pm, and make a big effort to combat the diuretic dehydration by drinking lots of water... dehydration is bad, on amphetamines its worse. Drink, drink, drink. you'll pee, pee, pee. And by 1am you might sleep, sleep, sleep. Caffeine + amphetamines... that might be your issue :)","f07bv3h",1,1568457194,"2019-09-14 10:33:14"

"5247","I know exactly what you're going through right now because I went thru the same thing. Found out I had ADHD, didn't tell my parents because I was too scared, and tried to self medicate. (I only used coffee and stuff like that b/c I didn't wanna take drugs illegally.)

I know it's not just as easy as telling your parents because sometimes they just don't get it and you can't change that.

What I did was talked to my school counselor first, talked about my SYMPTOMS only and never mentioned ADHD. She brought ADHD up on her own and I suggest you do that first. If they reach the ADHD conclusion on their own, you know you have an ally that can back you up and help you get treatment. Don't mention the illegal medication to them until you know what the school policy is, they may be required to tell someone if you admit to drug use. 

Next, I decided to tell a parent that I thought would support me most. I picked my mom because I know my dad doesn't believe in ADHD or medication. Again, I told her about my symptoms first. I talked about the anxiety and self-loathing caused by my inability to focus. Don't mention ADHD until they are on board and tell you they want to help you.

If that is successful, the next step is to stop taking the illegal adderall. If you want a legal source of medication, you need to be clean. 

Be careful telling anyone you are taking it illegally as that will make it harder to get it legally. Anyone you tell may tell your doctor once you get an appointment so keep that in mind.

"5248","The best way I’ve found to keep organized and tidy is to be one with the garbage. Be diligent about throwing shit away that you don’t use or need anymore. Not used that cord in a year? Toss it. Is that a receipt from 6 months ago? Do you remember buying any of that shit? No? Toss it. Have you worn that piece of clothing in the last year? No? Do you feel like wearing it right this second? No? Toss it!

This mindset not only helps me stay clean but it also gives me an easy entry point to wanting to do more. 

Once you clean a small space you get that kick of the feel goods. And you want to clean a bit more. 

Declutter. Let yourself get caught up in the minutia if you need to. So long as you’re still making progress of your initial goal; declutter. 

And as someone else pointed out. Don’t leave empty handed. Do you have to take everything? No! But something is better than nothing. :D

"5284","Here in the US it's in the law that any institution that receives federal funds has to provide reasonable accomidations, from one of the laws itself, from [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_504_of_the_Rehabilitation_Act) Wikipedia page):

""No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service.""

It's later expanded on in the Americans with disabilities act, which is pretty long so harder to quote from, that reasonable accomidations have to be provided as long as they don't cause ""undue hardship"" on the provider. 

It's not really that the disability office itself has authority over the professors, it's that the law has authority over the professors, and enough student with disabilities will be needing accomodations and such that it was in the universities best interest to create a disability office to faciliate accomodations being set up and provided for, so because the law says the accomidations have to be provided, and just letting each student try and fend for themselves legally would be a pain in the ass for everyone (because the school would probably eventually end up sued for not providing the accomdations) so it's better to make that process easier on everyone by having the disability office there and the American with disabilities act is really the one with the authority over the professors, if that answers your question? 

[This](https://www2.ed.gov/documents/news/section-504.pdf) is a big PDF relating to the enforcement of the Americans with disabilities act, basically, there is an office whose entire purpose is to protect and enforce civil right, protections people with disabilities is part of this, they use the law to try and ensure civil rights for everyone, and they would be part of who would force schools to give accomidations, they (The Office of Civil Rights) might be who you would go to in the US if a school/professor didn't want to give you accommodations and there wasn't a disability office to go to, I don't know if your country would have a comparable organization that could help.

"5301","Thank you!

Well I’m not a doctor, but I can tell you what I’ve learned from my experience with it. 

I cannot, under any circumstances, neglect my sleep, diet, or exercise when taking it. While that’s of course important in general, it’s doubly so while taking stimulant meds because they compound the negative effects of sleep deprivation. So much so that it was a factor in putting me in the hospital a while back due to severe anxiety attacks! 

My friends notice when I’m on it, and they don’t like it. They say it turns me into an jerk, and I’m inclined to believe them. I’m already pretty neurotic, so having that kind of upper in me makes it even worse. 

The other major problem for me, and it’s related to the first two, is I cannot subjectively know when these things are happening or about to happen. It’s only the next day(or sometimes smoking a joint will do it) that I realize that I’ve been acting like an inconsiderate ass and that my thought process was abnormal. 

It’s quite strange to experience because once I’m back to normal, I can see the thoughts I was having are not what I’d like them to be; but when I take the meds again, those same thoughts no longer appear to me as a problem. It’s like it temporarily diminishes my ability to have empathy. It’s like I’m a completely different person. Me on adderall and me not on adderall would probably get into arguments all the time!

I meant the teens and 20 something year-olds chasing the dragon, thinking it might be a good idea to pop some prescription pills for laughs as long as it gets them high in any which way.

That for me is what, referring to the title, constitutes genuine abuse. Not needing something but using it for pure selfish reasons.

That's what it was like living with my mom. When I was a teenager and living with my dad and stepmom (Mon-Fri), I never had junk food, and the only ice cream they would buy was Vanilla....Vanilla... So at 18, when living with my mom, I gained around 15 lbs. 

To overcome junk food cravings, I restricted myself to only peppermints and gum (10 peppermints throughout the day, then tapered off from there). This helped me lose the weight in a couple months. I also started going to the gym. 

After that, I went on a 30-day ""No Junk Food"" Challenge. It was extra challenging because she bought just soooo muuuch juuunk. She still does, and that's just one of the reasons I can't live with her.  (still love her heaps, but at the same time, it's too hard to be healthy). ","d8b6ybh",3,1475438984,"2016-10-02 20:09:44"

Of course I'll hang on to it for the rest of my life and kinda not want to see him anymore despite that he's one of the good guys.

I think eating disorder recovery will dramatically improve my quality of life. I mean, the only time my life was in good shape was high school because i avoided binge eating pretty well. But i later learned that i still wasnt recovered back then because i replaced binge eating with restricting. But just skipping meals. Eating low calories every day is called restricting. While excessive exercise (especially om low calories) is a form of purging. 

So really i was never recovered back in high school. The eating disorder just changed. And when university got busy, it was inevitable that my ability to restrict would end, and i fell back on binging for the next 9 years.

But as an adult man with a career I'm only now realizing that a lot of my struggles are not with doing the work itself (I used the word lazy, but it's more avoidant than anything), and with the right gear I'm less anxious or sensitive to those triggers. I can train MMA boxing and kicking without extra gear just fine, but I hate hate HATE the feeling of other people's gi's in Jiu Jitsu. Had similar issues in wrestling back in high school.

So for now, I do hands-on plumbing inspections with thin nitrile gloves at work, in the face of mockery, otherwise my job gets a lot harder to be proactive in.

I never realized that not everyone dealt with that.My wife confronted me last month and I really didn't want to hear it. I was kind of angry. As I did the research though it became pretty clear that that's what it was. Went to the doctor last Friday and was issue a prescription.   
&gt;  
&gt;So far the biggest experience has been one I didn't expect. Understanding this was a thing and that there was something else going on other than just ""my weakness"" re-contextualized a lot of my work experience. I was talking to a friend about this and he sent me a gif of that scene in Good Will Hunting where Robin Williams tells Matt Damon ""It's not your fault.""

Kids (and babies) are really good at letting you know when they need something. The trick (for most parents I think, not just ADHD) is realizing that they are asking for something when they are acting like monsters. I mean, unless you're very depressed or addicted to something, they aren't going to let you get too distracted to feed them. You'll end up following a schedule because they turn into gremlins if they don't sleep enough and the schedule falls in place around naps. You might lose track occasionally, but for the most part it's easy to follow because it's what keeps your life functioning. ESTABLISHING a schedule is harder... didn't happen for me until my son started half day preschool at 19 months. But he wasn't hurt by the lack of planning, I was just slowly losing my mind. :-) It was much easier the second time around because the schedule was already in place and I had a better idea of what to expect.

http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HF3500-60-Wake-Up-Light/dp/B00F0W1RIW
Go to bed at about the same time every night if you can- consider taking melatonin (especially if you are taking meds for ADHD). You can buy it at just about any grocery store. I have five kids, two with ADHD like me and the melatonin ""knocks them out"" safely in about 30 minutes. A good night's rest can be the key to waking up on time. 
If you don't sleep well because your mind is racing about what you have to do the next day then write yourself a brief to-do list to remind you. Then tell your brain not to worry and get some rest. Consider meditation before bed as well to help you fall asleep. 

Last, if worst comes to worst, find work that fits you - not the other way around. Some jobs can be very flexible about when you show up. Also, consider talking to your boss about your condition, see if you can offer something to compensate:
Boss, I have to accept that I am who I am and I'm probably going to be a little late sometimes. But, once I am here I will give 110% and stay late every day to balance out the time - if it is ok.

cross country, basketball, track

 (earned a varsity letter in cross country)

drama

clubs
interact, journalism, SADD, probably more

(interact got to help decorate the Rotary floats for the rose parade! that was awesome!) 

ran for treasurer didn't win

oh yeah and was 16 and preg. Graduated 3 months before having my daughter at 17 (transfered to a teen mother school, actually got out of school before the rest of the girls because we could work at our own pace, again I wanted to be out. I finished earning my credits 6 weeks before graduation and only had to come back for graduation oh and no way I was missing grad night pregnant or not Disneyland was on the to do list) Because there were only 3 of us, I was the val. I read a poem at our ceremony.


one of MY coping skills is to have a ton of things going on. When I would do homework I would have both the tv and radio on and often I was on the phone.  If my mind had enough things to do, I could get it done.

Hubby and I were at dinner the other night and he was looking at me with adoration. I was like what? He was like you really can't sit still. So I started holding my hands, but then my foot started moving. It was funny. I couldn't keep all areas stopped at once.

I got in a ton of trouble too!

It's nice to see you try to understand ADHD as much as you have, I appreciate it and I'm sure your girlfriend does too! 

Intrusive thoughts are annoying, if you see me walking alone you might spot me mutter under my breath something like ""shut the f*** up, I'll kill you"" *(to my brain)*, I've found excessively violent phrases like that properly cut my train of thought and reset things *(because how would something like that not grab* **all** *of your attention)*. Thankfully I don't think anyone has ever heard me do that, otherwise I'm sure I'd have some form of authority knocking on my door the following day.

Also oh my god, procrastinating while simultaneously stressing over the simplest of tasks! You just do it and it's like, why did i leave it so long. Then just rinse and repeat the following day.

As a side note:(it might just be me) I found it a little condescending when you gave advice on the importance of confidence and the validity of our feelings. We all know that, however confidence isn't something that's easily built, especially when due to ADHD it's usually been pounded into the ground for **years**

I'm now curious if the interest in people is an ADHD thing? I don't care for small talk, but I am thoroughly interested in how people are different since it works both ways, I can't fully understand neurotypical, I only get one brain, I can't test it out.

Or you can send the insurance an appeal/grievance letter stating the fact, and let them know it would disrupt your quality of life and medical treatment. Be direct, be honest, and if you need to get your doctor involved it can help. Denial is common with insurance companies and ADHD meds as it is and if there is/are possibilities of changing meds that can be interrupting to your day to day life or anything, it is better they know it. They may not have prior information or medical treatment/medications as before, as medical is as priviledged as medical history and isnt so easily disclosed, in short, it is so you end up with a higher chance of keeping the medication you were already on and not having to switch or test out new medications.

Edit: I was thinking it was still the NP but it isnt, you may need a referral out to get proper treatment. Sounds like a ton of things to deal with unless you have a lot of undisclosed health problems/risks.","cmc8m5e",3,1416884633,"2014-11-25 03:03:53"
"5507","Hey :)
A feeling I can most relate to.

What has worked so far:
(leaving as already mentioned) 

Cataloging what I am hearing. So it's not EVERYTHING but finite.

Picking one thing and concentrating on that (my favorite is my own breath, a thing I practice in yoga so it's easier for me). So everything I am going to do starts and ends with that concentration point. It's okay to loose focus, just return. Again and again. 

More naps! I am way more sensitive when it comes to noise when I am overstimulated. I don't even have to sleep, but taking some time in a mostly silent environment with closed eyes helps processing the input I received. And after 20 min. I feel like a new human being :)

If nothing else works and I am close to breaking: trying to let go of the tension little by little during exhales. Every exhale is a chance to let go. I inhale (omg that thing and this and her and him... Notice, don't judge!) and exhale (the thoughts and inputs I held melt away). Ideally the shoulders take part in an up *down* style. (That means relaxing the shoulder during exhaling). Doesn't always work immediately, but guess what you're still going to in a few seconds? Exhaling! New chance :)","ftkyae7",1,1591794364,"2020-06-10 13:06:04"

"5529","I'm an ADHD introvert. I got bullied a lot when I was younger for being a 'weird kid'- I didn't say much, but what I did say was almost never contextually pertinent. I would move around a lot and annoy people with my fidgeting. My parents were pissed because I wandered off a bunch and just started pretending/playing around when I should have been doing other things. My teachers hated that I would ignore them in class and just hyperfocus on a book, then still get decent grades. 

What's particularly apt is the comparison of ADHD to standing in a 'soft rain of post-it notes'. I can't ever pay attention to what's going on around me. My mind wanders so hard when I'm off my meds. I would avoid doing homework and chores as a kid, not by playing video games/TV/etc, but by just sitting and staring out a window and thinking, like enslaved by a crazy chain of thoughts.

My friend who's more inattentive type gets anxious from the stimulants she's tried. No idea if that has any effect just sayin lol. If you weren't anxious before the adderall, then the adderall is probably making gou ancious, it does do that to some people. 

There are other meds you can try, if what you're on doesnt work. Anxiety is no fun. You don't want to go back to that. 

When life events make me super extra anxious adderall and caffeine are the only way I can get a break from the anxiety :P 

Only you know your body, so if you were never anxious before adderall even with life events then, it's probably the adderall...

Basically if you feel very strongly that it wasn't the adderall then, if you still feel anxious without it and try all the other options they want you to maybe you can try again.

While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

"5573","Any chance you are in Germany where instead of the WHO gold standard for adult treatment, elvanse (dexamphetamines extended release = 12 hours of med activity - plus behavioural therapy), they prescribe medikinet (Ritalin extended release = methylphenidate = having a shorter activity phase of 4-6h - plus behavioural therapy) first if you’re diagnosed as an adult (they do prescribe elvanse right away for kids)? Because you might want to ask your doc about trying Elvanse adult so that you can take one in the morning, be fine for the 12 hours it works and then slowly fizzle out in the evening to a point where you’re able to sleep. Elvanse usually doesn’t have such harsh rebound effects after it wears off either, so that might also help you with the sleep problem.

It might also be worth noting that effects and side effects of both medikinet and elvanse may not be linear - you might fare better with less side effects on a higher dosage, even if that’s counter intuitive because one would think that a lesser dosage would cause less unwanted effects. You might. Might also be that this would be too much for you, in which case you’d notice jitteryness and more intense adhd symptoms etc. 

You might also just fare better with a form of medikinet with a different carrier starch (so a generic) because the galenics (how you metabolise the med) might differ based on the carrier/helper substance. Most other medikinet generics have wheat starch as a carrier, which medikinet has not, which you just might metabolise differently, causing some different effects/effects to have different timespans than what you take now.

You might even be able to fall asleep better when medicated - at least that was the experience of a friend of mine who just as me has Adhd. You might want to - even if it sounds counterintuitive given that you had troubles sleeping - try out to take your meds half an hour to an hour before sleep and see where that takes you (in an environment where you then don’t just hyperfixate on a phone or tv screen instead of trying to sleep, and on a day where you’re free the next day just in case it doesn’t work out). 

You’ll need to experiment with all of that, I think. And it’s a good thing that your psych lets you do that. You might want to write down the results of each test and bring that to your next appointment so your psych can help you find a solution together. 

Other experiments: you could try to take your meds earlier, later, lower doses but more over the day, one larger dose once, higher and lower doses overall, meds with a different carrier/helper substance, try feeling whether you experience evening hyperness from the meds or the lack of meds (because you might even feel hyper after the meds wear off because you have a comparison to how it feels like when they are still active, then put that effect on the meds when it’s just you *not* being on meds); it might be you’re taking too much, causing you to be unable to sleep, or too little/too long ago - 

you’ll need to experiment because adhders don’t react all the same to the same dosage or intake regime. You also might need to try out elvanse instead of medikinet, or a medikinet generic. You’ll also need to figure out signs of when your meds slowly taper out as opposed to you experiencing side effects from the med, which might be hard with usually worse “feeling what’s going on in yourself” alertness when off the meds.

So dealing with people is just too much for me. I guess maybe that is why I have no friends and skip opportunities to befriend people. I remain at a distance, the perfect little autist. It is exhausting to be me.

Even without coffee, though, all meds (not just ADHD) suffer from this problem.  You take them and they get absorbed.  It's tricky to make them absorb at the right rate so there's enough in your blood to have the right effect but not too much to have bad side effects.

Also I talked to a psychiatrist and it went awfully. I didn’t feel like she was listening to me. So I’m kinda just like... idk what to do with this diagnosis. I guess just go on with my life. I’m still me. I am still struggling with the same problems. But I do feel like I’ll be successful going forward finally, like I have all the pertinent information about myself at the least. I’m just a little hopeless about medication after talking to the psychiatrist. It was really hard for me to come forward with my problems. I felt so stupid and crazy. She did a very terrible job at validation and listening and now I almost regret seeking out help in the first place! I’m trying to remind myself that I have other options and not all mental health providers are like that. I have had lots of good experiences as well.

1. Get a purse organizer or default to purses with a few pockets. Definitely get a purse organizer if you have more than one bag/purse you use regularly.
2. Everything needs to have a 'home'. Pick out what you actually need to carry with you, and then find a place for it in the purse. Conversely, when you take something out it needs to go back home. If it's a consumable item, it gets replaced (or a note written down to replace it) immediately.

"5622","Thank you so much for your insightful response!!! You definitely stated good points. For memory capability, I just know if it’s anything important, I make sure to have it noted like a check list so because I know I would probably forget something. Like for example, it started when I got my first cellphone. I “lost” it and that was not a fond memory with my mom. But I luckily misplaced it in the house. Then my wallet, my mom scolded me plenty when I kept forgetting to bring my wallet with my ID when I started driving. So since then and always, I make sure anytime I go anywhere I check with myself “wallet, keys, medicine, phone.” And I recite it a few times while checking just to make sure and ease my mind. Oh also I remember doing the screening assessment, the doctor would ask me numbers then words or something and to recite back to him but I just remember sitting there getting mad after a few rounds that I couldn’t recall them all and that I can’t even do a that simple task. For organizations, again when I was young, my parents would yell at me all the time about school. My backpack was trashed and I always forget to bring home textbook that I needed for the homework. One time, I definitely remember in 4th grade, I left my backpack at my babysitter’s house and yeah...my dad was livid when he was walking me to the bus stop asking where my backpack was. From my upbringing, I definitely made sure to have important stuff in certain places. My office desk doesn’t look the best but I know where things are. For time, like for appointments I’m either late because I don’t know where my head is or I make sure to be prepared and be there super early because I’m sick and tired of paying for appointments that I’m not even there for. I know it’s my fault but I’m working on it. For time management... that’s a different story. To be honest, this is another reason why at work I’m not doing so well and same with school. Like for deadlines, I know when the deadlines are but days and weeks before hand, I literally can’t get anything done. I just know myself and that literally the day or two before the deadline, I would get super fucking stressed and that would motivate me to grind it all out and get it done. Like this is a problem I have with myself that I don’t understand and it definitely showed on my annual review...but I’m working on it. Lastly, no on the directions. This is the same with if it’s important, I have to write it down because I’m know I’m gonna forget. Also, writing it down ease my anxiety because I don’t have to put effort into remembering since it’s already written somewhere like on my phone. Thank you for your questions!!! I’m glad I put thought into this. I have an appointment with my resident psychologist tomorrow so I will let her know. You’re a huge help!!! ","e74w8qi",2,1538628266,"2018-10-04 04:44:26"

"5625","I agree with everyone who says drugs. In 2014 My spouse was diagnosed with Crohns, recently he had a flare up which resulted in multiple surgeries, corrections to those surgeries and some lengthy time away from work. In addition, he suffers from major depressive disorder and severe anxiety. We have been together for 10 years but it wasn't until recently (within the past 2 years) that symptoms started to show. For the most part, my spouse has always been a strong leader, taking care of everything. Now, with everything that's going on I've had to step up and it has been a challenge. I've felt lost, defeated, angry, confused, sad, and so much more.  I've been trying to support my spouse mentally and emotionally. I take care of house choirs except cooking (cooking is a stress relief for him) our 3 dogs, cat, and 3 turtles. My dog 4 days ago was in an altercation which resulted in her eye popping out the socket. Funds have been scarce as he has been out of work. I still have to go to work Monday - Friday and put on a fake smile. I've had no time to take a mental break. In addition I've recently been diagnosed with add ( explains why sometimes I just cant pull it together). Drugs and personal time has helped so much. I smoke weed in the evening to relax my mind and body. Just started vyvanse but I can already feel a difference in my oroductivity, completing task are now so much easier. And personal time to just relax and breath without anything demanding my attention has help a lot. Oh and communication, being open about things that are going on has provided me with a support system that has helped me hold it together.

I always have the strong desire to read with many different books in mind, but I can never bring myself to actually pick up the book and READ. I've found that usually, if I can get through a few minutes of actually reading a book I'm interested, then my hyperfocus will take over and I'm liable to read 100+ pages at a time. 

Despite this though, I can read half of a book on one sitting and be totally engrossed in it, but once I put it down, I know there will be a huge struggle to ever pick it up again. This leads to me reading half of a book or so and never picking it up again to finish it. I like reading and I know that I like the book, but it is seemingly IMPOSSIBLE to pick up the book, get totally focused and sucked in by the book, and actually read a significant portion.

Okay, I have ADHD-PI and General Anxiety Disorder. I'm also a psychology student, so while not actually qualified to answer this, I will try and give you helpful suggestions for you to talk to your doctor about.

Inattention or tunnel vision like you are describing is a symptom of ADHD, but also of anxiety. It's one of the reasons a diagnosis of anxiety can be mistakenly given for ADHD (and also they are comorbid a lot of time too...). It is possible the ritalin is sufficient to treat your ADHD but whatever you are taking for your anxiety is not doing a sufficient job controlling it. 

Another thing, you mention benzodiazepine. I don't know your history of use with these drugs, and I certainly would never tell you to stop taking them, but they can have effects of sleepiness or reduced concentration. Both of which would not go hand in hand with driving. They also are not recommended to take for longer than 4-6 weeks at a time unless all anti-anxiety medications have failed. Possibly talking to your doctor about starting you on a different anti-anxiety medication might be a good idea. A SSRI or SRNI are options you two could look into. 

I also see you mention not having a psychiatrist. In most places family doctors (or general practitioners, depending what you call them) are able to deal with basic prescriptions regarding disorders. Even a walk in clinic will likely be able to direct you on use of anti-anxiety medication.

The best example I can think of for me, is being medicated and having a good day and a productive shopping trip, and nevertheless misreading the bus schedule.

So i started walking back (very cross, with a heavy shopping bag in the hot sun).  a few minutes later, I glanced back and there was a bus a couple of blocks behind me. I was near another stop by then, so i took that one and asked the driver if there was some traffic problem downtown.🙄

At the airport, i have to constantly check those monitors because I have unintentionally memorized my seat number, or i have inversed the gate number.

I know this so well
I dont talk about my problems for this reason. I think I just always second guess myself and own thoughts about my physical and mental health. Anytime I need to tell someone about a problem (the other day I was sick and couldn't go to school) I get nervous about trying to 'convince' them that my problem is legit. And then I wonder that if I have to do so much convincing, then is it really legit? I also fear what would happen if they arn't convinced i would look like a liar. I often just keep telling myself that I do have a problem so I can tell someone but I always feel like I'm lying. 

When people say stuff like 'oh, I do that too, every one does!' I really feel bad and guilty and don't want to talk about it anymore.

One time someone opened up to me about her problems with an adhd-type variant and it felt really good to talk to someone in real life who wouldn't dismiss my problems as 'every one has that'. I also didn't feel fake.

If you can, saving up for a day off might be something to add into the mix so you can motivate yourself to work a bit longer on some (good) days so you'll have one really nice day where you can sleep in and just reddit/game without an alarm more often. It might also help you to say 'no' to distractions on most days if you know that you could either game a little now (with all the added risks), or cocoon and get lost in the game completely the whole Thursday. 

If that isn't possible, I'd go for option 3 and try to work on the things that make you lax with the rules. If it's feeling too sleepy, try working on your sleep habits, and keep telling yourself that it's ok to have an off day once in a while. We all have them. Telling yourself the whole system failed because you couldn't do it all days from the start is sabotaging yourself! 

You have a system that works, this week it might work 4 days, next week it might work 5, the week after 3, then 5 again. The more days it works for you, the closer you are to making it a habit you do without thinking.

Having a day the system doesn't work doesn't mean there's something wrong with the system and you need to start over. It means you fell of the wagon one day, but the more you practice not letting that one day get to you and starting over again the day after, the more consistent you'll be in the long run.

People may forget to clean, but what they really lack is the motivation to clean, because they see it all the time. I know I'm going to get some hate for this...

You're gf is right, adhd can make you feel stupid. But it's not that she's stupid, it's that she missed part of the conversation, and is struggling to keep up. Then she misses some other details because she's distracted from trying to figure out what she missed. And Becky is making that stupid fucking look on her face like she always does when I missed a detail. And how many times has she told Becky to knock it off? And wait, she just spaced out again because she was pissed at Becky. It's a really nasty feedback loop.

BUT, your gf knows she has adhd. She's just insecure, like everyone. Just understand that you need to explain things a second or third time. It's not that she's stupid, it's that her brain wandered without permission. It sucks. What she needs to learn, is that it's okay to ask people to repeat themselves. What you may not be aware of is adhd people in grade school had teachers constantly saying, ""I'm only saying this once""... I can promise you when I teacher said that to me, it triggered a brain wandering session for me as I obsesses about every time I've heard a teacher say that before, and I missed the homework assignment. So your gf is going to have some big issues with asking people to repeat themselves. What she needs to do is forgive herself, and understand that teachers were wrong for doing that.

"5717","It's normal that your doctor didn't immediately slam you with a high dose. You start low and later work together to find what works for you best.

&amp;#x200B;

Your meds should be accomodating your lifestyle, and if 8 hours is not enough for you to lead a productive life, your dr will probably tweak it a bit, add another med, or increase the dosis.

My tip do you is to keep a med journal: note down how you feel each day, what improvements you see and what you are still missing. Also note the side effects and new problems you are facing.

I used to note: mood - productiveness - attentiveness -  emotional regulation - time of crashing - sleeping pattern - appetite - blood pressure - heart rate - physical issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I did it because I figured there's no point of increasing the dose to make you fully attentive for 20 hours a day if it's going to cause you physical issues, ruin your sleep or cause long term problems upon your general wellbeing. It's important to find balance.

My dr loved the feedback. We've managed to find the perfect med treatment and I'd recommend the approach to everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, finding the right treatment is a long road and not everything will work for you, but if you kep track of it's effectiveness, you can get there faster and with fewer struggles.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: All normal for starting the treatment. Track the effectiveness of your meds and discuss it with your dr at your next app.","e6fnusa",2,1537623297,"2018-09-22 13:34:57"

"5736","Interesting. I think I need a new doctor.

  * When I complained about adderall side-effects (primarily insomnia and anxiety), I was told that my adhd is not real **and** he gave me a prescription for a refill of adderall. All in a 5 minute span because that's all the time he has for appointments.
  * When I asked about alternatives to adderall he said he wouldn't prescribe strattera because I'm a guy (something about male side-effects and painful urination/ejaculation).
  * He works in an adult adhd clinic at a reputable hospital so I figured he would be good at his job. So far I've been wrong.

As a result I've been unmedicated for about three weeks and I've fallen back into all my disorganized and procrastinating routines with 3-4 ""hobbies"" at once and neglected obligations :(

One day in high school, out of frustration, I decided to write a list of things I needed to do, and make 'Write a List' the first item. I wrote two or three items and checked off the first one. And completing tasks on that list just snowballed. Checking an item off the list feels AMAZING. And that boost helps you get to the next item on the list. You can trick yourself into getting started by making that first item on the list easy to check off... But it can't be a do nothing task. It actually has to be a real task you need to do.

The next big innovation was making sure to disconnect having the idea of adding an item to the list and needing to execute that item immediately. That also took time to get better at. And for personal projects, its' still a struggle. I start a lot of projects before adding them to my Kanban board. But it's fun stuff, so I'm not too hard on myself about it.

"5755","This is almost my exact experience over the last ~2 months. I'm 34M for the record. Grew up in the same ""ADHD is bullshit"" mentality, which my parents still hold to. I stumbled across a reddit thread about ADHD (can't find it, but it was about Eastern cultures and their different approaches to work ethic/mental illness), and I felt like all these strangers were putting my entirely personal, extremely private feelings about all sorts of life experiences into words. It was *weird.* From there I found Dr. Barkley's videos, and went on the same Youtube binge you apparently did. I think we watched the same video about ""If you do (x), give yourself a point."" I got all the points and was nearly in tears by the end of it.

Now, roughly 7 weeks later, I've been through some testing with my therapist (who I was already seeing, thank god) and we're pretty positive I've got combined-type ADHD. I got a perfect score on the Inattentive side, and the Hyperactive questionnaire took two sessions because apparently I can't sit still or focus when I'm thinking about how much I fidget. I have an appointment with a psych in about a month, so my diagnosis is ongoing, but man, it's like I've been struggling to adjust my eyes in a dark room for my entire life and someone just turned on a light. It's all so obvious.

Your last paragraph before the ""Reason for my post"" line is where I've been stuck lately. Like I'm re-processing every. single. memory. in this new light, wondering what could have been different, forgiving myself for past fuckups, growing angry at the adults in my life who should have been helping but just made things more difficult...

Anyway, I too am trying to sort through my behaviors and figure out what's what. It helps me to remind myself that a lot of my hard-earned good habits are actual coping mechanisms recommended by doctors and therapists: Good diet, exercise, plenty of sleep, routines that minimize cognitive overhead (keys on a hook by the door, etc.). It also helps that I now have a name for the reason why I get enraged at household clutter, noisy neighbors, and other distractions. For a very long time I thought I was just... I dunno, a little crazy?

It's been pretty tough for me, and I imagine for you as well. Just hang in there and know you're not alone. Others have gone through this before, more will in the future, and some of us are even going through it right along with you.

"5759","Keep in mind this is my own theory and it's 2am here! I might state opinion as fact here based on my experience

I would speculate that it's not so much the hyperfocus, rather the task switching problems so prevalent in ADHD people. Task switching problems give the impressiuon of hyperfocus but productivity is very different.

Both have the signs of someone engrossed in what they are doing but there's very different reasons for them. In fact, the task switching element to hyperfocus is what differentiates an ADHD person's productive focused spells from those of a non ADHD person

 Hyperfocus is when there is no stimuli that can get your attention away (where you can focus and work perfectly). When I hyperfocus I rarely struggle with working through a task, although it is alike to the task switching in that I won't do anything else. Pure hyperfocus is very rare to me (Ritalin can make me enter this state).

Task switching problems apply where you have normal ADHD focus issues but you have no motivation to change what you're doing or have obsessive interest in the specific task being up to standard and cannot stop until it's done. This is the norm personally 

I have the same problem, however on medication I can force myself to move on (even though Ritalin makes me more likely than usual to micromanage every detail). I find that unmedicated there is no happy medium between a rushed job and an attempt at perfection. However with my meds I am able to suit my work much more adequately to the time frame as well as being able to move on and come back when i need to. The only problem is sometimes i can't tell when i need to stop over analysing it.","d3f661t",2,1463925414,"2016-05-22 13:56:54"

No matter what, I think it's a good idea to stay on this for a while, even if I still feel like an ADHD mess (I think this is what you're saying). I felt it work at first, so it's probably still the drug for me. I'm sure my doc will let me increase dosage to 40mg.

And you're right again, it doesn't FORCE me to be productive. Maybe I was so productive the first few days because I was really excited about focusing and doing work, but now I've just gone back to my own ways. I've gotta admit, I've been out of the normal world for a good minute now, living at home, unemployed. Lots of stuff going on as well. I can't even hold a good sleep schedule, and that should honestly be priority #1. So it's like...I really have nothing forcing me to get healthier by tomorrow. In a sick way, I enjoy where I'm at in life. I don't want to work, I don't want to have a normal life.

Thanks for your comment, it's really making me feel better. Now I'm just wondering if I even need to mess with my dose as well or if I need to work harder first. I suppose it probably won't hurt to try 40mg if 30mg isn't giving me any problems, but I'll have to get it in my head that next week I HAVE to fix my sleep schedule, take my meds same time every day, focus on a few specific things, etc. Create a list of short-term goals.

I was previously dedicated to P90x before my back went out and in 3 months I went from 190 to 160.  It wasnt an unsustainable diet and I followed it so long I actually preferred the taste of ""clean"" foods over junk.  Then my back went out... Enter questionable choice of pain management while waiting on surgery and I gained it all back.  But damn did twinkies taste terrific those 2 months.  ;)  

Now all that is behind me and I started P90 (P90xs little brother) and am back on the meal plan.

But if you want help, first start by seeking professionals. Maybe figure out your ADHD type, try some meds and see what works. It took me until I was 30 to get my life going + dream job and there are things I still struggle with. I work on one thing at a time and do a lot of experimenting. I lean a lot on my friends and my wife to help fill in where I’m not very good at things. Learn to harness some positives of ADHD. I’m creative, strive for high quality work, hyperfocus things I’m interested and can talk to anyone because I’ve had a million hobbies. Couldn’t have gotten where I am without that stuff. The stuff that is harder I develop ways to cope. 

I’m bad with time so I am extreme about my routine. I have a hard time getting out of the house so I eat the same breakfast every day, since this is where I get hung up. I forget things so I put post it notes and have white boards all over my house. I have dedicated spots for keys and phones. I interrupt people so I told my coworkers that I will raise my hands in meetings when I have something to say. I’m bad with money so I do all financial stuff with my wife and she helps me with impulsiveness. 

This has taken me 15 years to figure out what works for me. Hang in there, set your bar low so you’re always having success and develop a good sense of humor.

Not sure if this is something isolated to myself/not really something related to ADHD, but it's something that I've always gotten when I took my pill. I rarely have someone to talk to about these things, and since the occasions that I do have someone to talk to are so rare, I kind of drop these mental bombs on people and I feel it makes them uncomfortable. I suppose my point is that your group could be somewhere for them to go and talk about these things in a group that understand what they're going through, making it a more comfortable environment to discuss these deep topics.

Anyhow-back to the point; I was looking for some ""felt"" change in my ability to concentrate - as if my brain was going to pick priorities and automatically focus on the most important thing... but even if that would have been the case I would not have known because my performance was measured by my father's ability to judge how well I followed his orders, and his wildly changing internal expectations.","ee7x5qx",1,1547670635,"2019-01-16 20:30:35"

With nobody there to rouse me out of bed,  I overslept for a staggering amount of classes. I was late for everything. I left term papers til the last minute because I couldn't focus--although I passed in some brilliant papers, my day to day performance in class was generally terrible.

I told my mom, last semester of my senior year, ""I think there's something wrong. I can't focus. I just can't get this work done. I think I have ADHD."" 

Her response was ""YOU'RE TOO SMART TO HAVE ADHD."" And I believed her, until about 2 years ago, when I was diagnosed.

I look back at college and I think of all the opportunities I wasted and I'm angry at myself. But I also need to remind myself sometimes that, it wasn't my fault. It was like asking someone who can't walk to run a 5k, or a blind person to describe a painting they're standing in front of.

My timing while singing was pretty bad in the beginning but just keep working at it and it will get better. Also, like some others said, don't over do it. Work on chord shapes first and when you're confident in that, move on to transitioning between each (C to D, Em to G, G to D, etc.) until it's smooth. You don't even have to strum or press down too hard for this part. There's also different shapes for each chord if one of them is a little too difficult right now (like Barre Chords compared to Open or Power Chords).

Uh, kinda. Yes, unlike the US, one can purchase dihydrocodeine ( C18H23NO3 ) in over the counter cold medicines like BRON. Usually though the Japanese standards are much more stricter. 

Downers and sleeping pills also get relatively lighter treatment. For those wishing to use or abuse sedatives and hypnotics such as Rophynol, physicians will usually prescribe them quite freely. The TAKEDA-version of Rophypnol, Silece, doesn’t even have the stupid blue dye that authorities required Roche to add over two decades ago when Rophynol became synonymous with being “roofied” &amp; date raped ( alcohol continued to receive a free pass ...) .

To understand this a bit more, it has to do with the special place that stimulants have in Japanese history ...

Seriously though, yeah there have been some low points, but I have never blamed my ADHD.  I always remember something I figured out when I was pretty young, As long as I am still breathing, I can improve my situation.  In 35 years it hasn't let me down yet.

I will admit that I did not read the whole post at first so heres my story.

I was diagnosed at an early age.  was medicated from about six until 12-13 when I refused to take medication anymore.  I struggled with highschool, did summer school twice so I could graduate on time.

I tried college a few times, neither one really ""stuck"".  By 22 I was getting my electricity turned off and being evicted from my apartment.  This was a really dark period of my life.  I considered suicide a lot but thats really as far as it got.  Eventually I was forcibly removed from my apartment by an armed constable (it was kind of a surreal experience actually) I did not resist and went peacefully.  I ended up couch surfing for a little while and did a lot of introspection.  I decided that I did not want the life I had and started looking for jobs.  I found a job with an ISP doing phone support.  A year later, the company bought another ISP in another state where I had family.  I packed my shit up in my car, took the relocation money and paid all my debts (the eviction and utilities) and started over.  That was when I was 23.

I switched jobs to a telecommunications company about a year after I moved and I have been there since.  I bought a house in 2004 and got married in 2010.  Our first child is due in sept.

I always felt like suicide was giving up.  Giving up on life, giving up on myself, giving up on my dreams.  The conclusions that I always came to when considering suicide were that if I did it, I would be so very dissapointed with myself.  That was when I decided that no matter what, so long as I am breathing, any situation I am in can improve.  There are very few challenges that are truely insurmountable and if you believe it, then you can make it happen.

I don't want to turn this into a story from a guy living in a van down by the river, just trying to correct some of my initial insensitivity.

I struggled and still struggle with my ADHD on a daily basis.  Some days I am incredibly productive, outpacing my coworkers and producing a staggering amount of output.  Other days I can't stop clicking links....

one of the best things I figured out was determining what I am good at, interested in , and then figuring out what I need to do to get paid well to do it.

"5831","Friendship has multiple types.

I only have two regular-contact friends, and it's not very different from the communication you'd expect with an office buddy. Small talk and wishing each other well with occasional excitement when we have something more interesting happen. Both of these friends are incredibly isolated, and I make the extra effort so they have regular reminders that I'm there for them because their isolation worries me.

I have ~6 best friends whom I regularly lose touch with. We ARE busy, and there's an understanding that we love each other and will be there for each other within reason, and this does not change regardless of when we've last spoken. These are people I'd trust with my soul and have trusted with my home and kids at times. Occasionally, something comes up where we end up in touch a lot more, but often weeks and sometimes months will pass with no contact.

I have sorta-friends who I like and also contact/get contacted by once in a blue moon, but I don't quite trust them and wouldn't think much on it if they never contacted me again or vice versa.

Honestly, the people whom I feel need regular contact to maintain a connection are really just acquaintances in my book.

If you can figure out the function, you can come up with replacement behaviour that can be reinforced to reduce excessive talking.

My psych basically said that its healthier to get it through food and our bodies aren't really meant to get them all at once in supplement form, and if you are eating protein regularly and one fatty fish a week then you are getting enough amino acids and omega 3s anyway.

As for depression however, here's why I became often depressed.  

Trying to keep up with social and societal demands takes an almost unbearable effort, regardless of determination.  You know what you have to do, you try your hardest to do it, and you fail.  The cycle repeats, and soon after it wears you out emotionally and for me, physically.  

For me at least, when there was less pressure to accomplish things (such after I left college), my life became much happier, although my ADHD didn't let up one bit.  

So I don't think depression and ADHD go hand in hand, but for me, my ADHD definitely led me to being depressed many times over.  ","d17ntrj",2,1458550624,"2016-03-21 08:57:04"

I'm not autistic but yet sometimes i can't tell what social cues are going on. I'll keep talking and talking or say something i shouldn't have even though i didn't mean it in anyway bad. We a life of impulse and anger at ourselves, we have a brain that we can't control or functions normally.

Four years ago, I had a botched copper IUD insertion that was agonisingly painful, and has caused a whole range of subsequent health problems. To add insult to LITERAL injury, I found out a few weeks ago that I'll need surgery to remove the thing, because the strings have sucked right up into the abyss that is my cervix.

Standards are 100000x more stimulating than push and steer automatics.

"5990","I work as a freelance art department person in film and TV. It took me 6 years to get to the point I am now, but I'm finally doing well and making a decent (regular person) income. No health insurance or benefits, but I'm planning on joining the union this year, and hopefully that will follow. 

Most people I know with ADHD are self employed. My dad included. He's a lawyer, but works for himself and has never worked for a firm. Anything in the film industry is a great profession if you have ADHD, lots of change constantly, to keep it exciting, but relative stability if you live in a place where there is a lot of work. Atlanta, New York, LA, Toronto. The longest job I've worked was 5 months on a TV show.

Regardless of what you do though, it takes about 5-6 years to get established and successful in any field. Don't despair. Ability to handle emotional challenges takes a while longer for the ADHD set. I'm finally in a place where I feel like I can take what life throws at me, without acting in a way that's alienating to neurotypical people. I used to fly off the handle and handle frustration poorly, which isn't a good look, and is especially unexpected for a young, otherwise cheerful woman.

Freelance is always great for not losing interest, whether you are a writer, artist, film industry crew, caterer, etc. Its the road less traveled and not as safe and cozy as a corporate job, but never lacks in excitement.

"5998","**(1)** This is definitely something I plan on doing. The issue up to this point has been that I've wanted to avoid self medicating with coffee at the start of my day so I would take my pill the moment I woke up to start my day smoothly. Perhaps going to one cup of coffee plus a hearty breakfast like you described will be even better.

**(2)** This has been something I have been taking care of, I think. I drink right around 1-1.5 gallons of water a day. And even then it hardly seems enough. The first couple days/week I noticed the dry mouth and I've tried my best to stay hydrated.

**(3)** That is a great idea! I hadn't really thought of keeping things like almonds and other small healthy snacks on hand. It can be difficult to think of food planning and such when I'm never hungry.

**(4)** Weirdly, on days I take my pill I'm really not even hungry at dinner time. I think that might be more psychological than a true side effect of the medication though. I think this will probably just require a bit of dedication(?) on my part.

**(5)** Unfortunately, this will be the biggest struggle for me. Due to school (I'm an engineering student and averaging about 17 units/semester), time is a very rare commodity for me. I do make a commitment to things like riding my bike and walking to and from class everyday. It isn't ideal but I hope to find a better balance with exercise moving forward.

"6018","I personally have been diagnosed and treated as an adult for ADHD and have been on stimulant medication (adderall) for 5 and 1/2 years now. 
I have been on the same dose of adderall for the entirety of that time as well. 
I have had amazing success with stimulant medication and I can truthfully say that I wouldn’t be where I am today if I wasn’t being treated for ADHD. 
Sometimes I still struggle with sleep patterns and being wired late at night but that’s mainly due to me not taking my medication on time each day. 
I have NOT noticed any sort of tolerance or feeling of my medications being “less effective” over time.
There have been times where there were a few days before I was able to get my prescription refilled and those times can be difficult because my body tends to go into shut down mode for about two days and I sleep a lot and can be moody (which is normal coming off of most medications). 

I think that the main thing I’ve learned with balancing my ADHD with my life is that I can’t rely solely on medication to make me successful. Medication is absolutely a tool that aids my success but its not the determining factor of whether or not I’m capable of doing something. When I’m on my meds I am able to focus on just about anything I set my mind to... sometimes that’s not always the task that NEEDS to be done and that’s where I have to be an adult and recenter myself in what I need to get done before I go off and hyper focus on something else. 
There’s always going to be a balance with taking medication and dealing with ADHD. Even though I’m medicated and have been for over 5 years, k still struggle with certain things on a day to day basis like: forgetfulness, task management, and just normal day to day things like remembering to eat and drink water.

"6027","i’m in uni with unmedicated adhd, i’m forcing myself through it despite the prospect of doing the same thing for 3-4 years makes me restless and want to drop out every other semester. 

something that’s helped me a lot though is i take one less class a semester. it’s going to eventually cost me about 1/2 a year (which adds to the restlessness lmao) but it’s just easier on my brain and stops me burning out and actually dropping out

i might fully go part time next year or something and start working more so i can switch things up and get the restlessness out of my brain but on god i am going to finish my degree, i don’t care if it takes me 6 years I don’t care if it doesn’t lead to anything but i am going to finish it","fh5myvh",2,1581290516,"2020-02-09 23:21:56"

If you don’t trust yourself to remember to take the medicine again or are unable to then the longer lasting concerta would be better. According to ADDitude (my fav adhd website) Ritalin lasts 4-6 hours while concerta lasts 12. I’d think about your work/school schedule and then decide which works best for you.

That's a great way to look at it!

I'm glad that you're seeing a therapist that is great for you! ADHD coaching is sort of like applied (ADHD specific) cognitive behavioral therapy where they work with you to trouble shoot your challenges and help create and modify solutions that will work for you. 

Communication is so key to the doctor-patient relationship and it's important that they take your feelings and wishes into account when deciding your care. I just met with my doc for the first time since starting medication and there was a bit of a dance around the effect of the meds - it helped in areas of work that I struggled with less (staying on task and focusing) but didn't help much with a couple of problem areas. He sort of tried to adjust my expectations. I further explained that the work I was struggling with requires a lot of working memory and is challenging so it's easier to procrastinate. He decided to bump up my dose a little bit and we'll see how it goes. I'm hoping it helps but also completely okay with going back down in dose if I don't notice a benefit.

I think there is a load of difference when he's on adderall, but I know he doesn't like taking it so I try to be accepting.  I can deal with his forgetfulness/lack of commitment to things, but I know a lot of people wouldn't be ok with it.","d8usd1o",3,1476651242,"2016-10-16 20:54:02"

Before you even book the appointment, I would contact your doctor and see if they are willing to do shared care, if you got the diagnosis and planning on medication. If you don't do this and get the diagnoses, you may find they refuse to prescribe you the medication on the NHS. Sorry if this is a bit rambly, it's hard to explain over text 😂😂

They use this on the thumbnail, because if you've watched the entire video you probably like it and will click on it. While a video you don't know is less likely to do that.

Now they don't show more clearly it's a mix, because then your brain would catch up to the fact that it will take longer. If they use the video thumbnail it would make 'sense' that the video behind it will be the same length, except that it's a playlist. So if they don't make it obvious what the actual time of watching will be then you are more likely to click and invest more time then you actually want to.

Playlists also have a fun little thing to do with gambling, because you don't know what's behind the thumbnail, but from previous experiences it could be an even 'beter' video. Of course you want a better reward, so you click on the video.

First off, medication takes a while to start working. Be honest with yourself and your doctor until the dosage and medication are just right. Also be sure to eat something. If your appetite is affected, be particularly weary of how much you are eating and drinking to prevent getting sick or losing too much weight. 


Second, utilize all the resources you can. Speak to your college and professors. Also consider talking to your parents and others to get some support. Even my coworkers know and we often exchange tips and tricks for handling ADHD in the workplace.

Third, take care of yourself. School and work can suck, so remember to eat well, exercise, and relax enough. Don't be afraid to lower your course load, although I do not recommend taking even one semester off.

After that I got really self-conscious about how I tell a story. It's like my verbal filter clamped down hard whenever I was with a romantic interest afterwards, but I would say it's never really been there for my friends and family. With them I just go off on tangents to my heart's delight and don't really care if I've told a story once before or how disjointed it is. And if they get annoyed by that, no one's ever said anything.

"6145","What people are likely referring to is the fact that stimulants can cause emotional blunting in some people. That can make them seem and feel less lively or connected while the med is in their system. This could certainly cause problems in a sales type job. That being said you've been on Ritalin in the past and if it didn't happen then it is less likely to happen now. The only way to know is to try the Vyvanse. If it happens, stop it. If it doesn't, great.

Also, if you do notice some emotional blunting you can try a non-stimulant like Wellbutrin, Straterra or Intuniv. Or you could switch to short acting Adderall and Ritalin and use them during the non-sales part of the day to help you organize and then not use them when you're out interacting with people.","d3b3p1h",3,1463624696,"2016-05-19 02:24:56"

If I name the feeling it releases some of the tension and I can ask for a minute alone to cool down, or discuss how to diffuse the feelings with whoever I'm with.

"6151","I am newly diagnosed into the ADHD world, but I have a chronic pain condition which has taught me a shit load of lessons.  

One of the huge things I've found is our feelings and opinions are highly contextual, *they are not fact*.  During a pain flare up people annoy me much faster, I can't be bothered to do the things I enjoy, and my thoughts naturally turn negative.  When I am not in a flare up none of those are problems.  So which one is the real me? Am I less authentic when not in a flare up? More?

There is no ""true us"" that we are killing by taking medication.  We are always reacting to outside stimuli.  On top of that, we can decide who we are.  I don't like the person I am in a flare up so I work on getting healthier so that I have less flare ups, and I find ways of coping during a flare up that is healthier.  

What is your goal?  Do you want to be a worker who gets things done, who isn't frustrated by the minutiae of small tasks and has patience with customers? Then the medication is an excellent method to get you to that goal.  If you have a different goal that the medication isn't supporting you in then that is something to consider. 

Figure out your goals and that will help you decide what is right for you.  ","d346104",2,1463155272,"2016-05-13 16:01:12"

My doctor AND therapist have given me the best treatment I've received ever. They are accessible to me when I need to talk to them always and they even know about my numerous reddit postings.

I was primarily looking for feedback, not to better understand or diagnose myself, but to know that I'm not alone here. That is one of the major points of this subreddit, am I wrong? If so, I'll completely accept that I'm wrong and post on some mental/medical related subreddit.

Downvote me, I don't care. It's posting like yours that not only discourage posters from discussing their thoughts on a related subreddit, but also cause them to question whether it's even something people will help you with. Your comment was so unhelpful and so unrelated to my original posting that it is beyond humorous to me.

I'm asking for other's experiences to know that I'm not the only one. Even if it was to treat myself in a different way (which I would NEVER do because changing medication treatment from a post on the internet is silly as all get out), the purpose is to discuss! To discuss, and know that I'm not fucking crazy, and if I am crazy then everybody shame me. 

I want to know I'm not fucking alone. I want to know there are other people out there like me, and some of them may not be fortunate enough to have treatment as mine with my incredible therapists who have helped me so thoroughly. Your post is just really upsetting and discouraging. I don't want to be dicked with people on the internet telling me what I should do. The point of this isn't to determine a new course of action but to better understand other's experiences, relate and acknowledge (**not to change**).

"6165","TL;DR: +1

I'm finding the same thing. Vyvanse is way more effective, way more quickly than any other AD or AD combo I've been on in over 20 years. And I've been on A LOT, including Nardil which is the 'gold standard' MAOI for depression. 
Without it I feel there's no point in doing anything. My mind feels like it's full of cold custard. There's just nothing going on, like the lights were turned off. Vyvanse allows the real me to come out to a decent extent. I feel alive.
My main issue is that it lasts ~ 8 hours for me and then I turn into a depressed, monosyllabic vegetable again. I'm seeing my PDoc soon and am praying she'll give me IR Adderall to give me that boost I need once the Vyvanse wears off.

One addendum: I found the same thing with Concerta but its effect tailed off as the months progressed. Long term I really, really, really hope that I can perhaps alternate the two e.g. one month Concerta, one month Vyvanse.","dkujaq9",1,1501258956,"2017-07-28 16:22:36"

&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services guideline recommends considering bupropion or a tricyclic antidepressant as a fourth-line treatment after trying two different stimulants and atomoxetine.

The only reason to not start out with stimulants is risk of heart disorders, existing eating disorders or that you indicated prior drug misuse etc.

here is what you do, 
(1) you need to find a free clinic and get them to refer you to a place that does free or reduced priced testing for ADHD, once you test, it will confirm whether or not you have ADHD.
(2) once you are confirmed to have ADHD, you need a psychiatrist that will issue/counsel you for your ADHD.  Its sounds easy or it can seem overwhelming for a undiagnosed untreated ADHD person but these are the two critical strategic moves to get you across that bridge back to that side of the bridge where you were while on the 20 mg of adderall.

"6179","My son has a similar profile, exceptionally smart, serious ADHD, everything is a fight, definitely some ODD tendencies, but not enough for a diagnosis.

The only thing that has really worked with any consistency was explaining the WHY behind what we were doing. 'You need to do laundry because otherwise you'll be an adult with no idea how to do anything, this is important for you to learn.'

Engaging with any kind of verbal altercation with him means I've already lost. As SOON as I engage with whatever he's trying to start a fight about, it doesn't matter how hard I try, it ends poorly for all of us.

Removing privileges helped some - making the negative consequence match the thing he did wrong helped too. If you shout at people, you can go to your room, which is your own space, and shout all you like. You can come back out when you're ready to discuss calmly. Throwing a fit over a game, or throwing a fit that you are given a notification that you'll have to transition off that game in 5 minutes? We're going to have an afternoon without that game. Stuff like that.

I've also found that emphasizing his smartness has been actually incredibly helpful. He knew about his assessments, and I've shown him all his results and we've talked about them. It means that if he tries 'I don't know what to do' I can encourage him to use his super smart brain to work out the steps. I can lead him with 'okay, you told me that first you have to add the first column of numbers, right? What do you think should probably come next?'. My son takes great pride in how smart he is, so I've even been able to convince him that doing things like art (which he *hates*) is important because it exercises other parts of his brain, and if he wants to keep getting smarter, he has to do it.

Timers/alarms work wonders for us too. We have one every 15 minutes in the morning before school. First is for get dressed, Second is for brush hair and teeth, Third is for packing bag, etc. He fights me less because it's not ME transitioning him, it's the alarm. 4pm rolls around and the alarm goes off, that's unpack your bag and get a snack time. On Sunday, the alarm goes off at 11am and that's time to put your wash in the washer. We set a timer for an hour after he starts the wash, so he knows when to go back to put it in the dryer. Stuff like that has been extra helpful for us.

What are things that help you in your tasks? What are things that help you with maintaining emotional maturity? Can you implement any of them for her? Can you talk to her about how you find them helpful? Can you rope your husband into talking to her? I had to get my husband to speak to our son and remind him that I knew a lot about what he was going through and could probably help him if he'd let me. I will add that my son is 10 now, and with age comes a lot of emotional maturity that you can't really teach, you can only wait for. Around 7 was when we turned the corner with him with a lot of this stuff, it got a lot easier around then in general.","dt885lt",13,1516901928,"2018-01-25 17:38:48"

For me two things really helped: 

The first is joining clubs and groups that interested me. Especially in large universities this is vital because first it gets you around the same small group of people and second it gives you something easy to talk about. In small universities you can get away with just being in a certain public spot every day because you will be seeing the same people there. I actually had friendships develop in undergrad because I sat in a lounge for an hour between classes and so did three other people. 

The second is reading and putting into application the principles of *How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dale Carnegie.

They should give you a list of side effects to watch out for—some can cause heart issues or anxiety. I’ve heard stories of people feeling like zombies, for me personally I feel much more alert, my brain isn’t fuzzy and I feel more control of myself—I feel like this is what life without ADHD is like.  Just keep note so you can discuss with your med manager.

They may wear off at the end of the day. There are some things you may not be able to drink as much or at all—discuss these with your doctor. For example, I am not able to drink a lot of caffeine/alcohol.

 It may not turn you into a superhero, but if they work for you, then you get to play regular mode instead of hard mode. Good luck. :)

I was relieved because I needed it for college classes.  I stopped taking adderall after college because I hated the side effects. 

Enrolled in law school in August.  This time, I went to a psychiatrist.  She spoke with me for about an hour about my life in general and where I'm having trouble.  Then she offered me options for medications that were different than adderall.  I'm now on concerta.  I was relieved to get the script, but the meds feel like shit and I'm not excited for my follow up appointment tomorrow.

"6230","So yeah I am in was in exactly the same boat.  Sort of long but here goes..

Did undergrad for the most part without any adderall like 08-09 - top in my class summa cum laude on my own intelligence essentially.  Ivy league grad school was even only like 10-20mg here and there as a boost.  Always did suspect I was actually inattentive ADD tho.

Things went downhill getting a real job:  Got into private equity and things really got out of control. 2011-12: 40-60mg adderall with 70mg vyvanse minimum (all prescribed by one doctor) daily.  Sleeping every other night-ish.  2013-2015 120mg IR binges not out of the question using most days ( and everything in my mind still worked pretty well and I didn't look cracked out yet).  Professionally/financially going awesome.  2015-2018/19 240mg IR daily not sleeping, work became impossible (and everyone notices earlier than you think, trust me) but I couldn't get off the treadmill - and looking back it would have been so so much easier to just walk away and quit my job and sleep and just turn the switch off then.   Soo bad.

Things crashed last February ('19) with hospital, cardiac issues, cortisol (transient though), liver issues (alc + adderall is horrible for this).  Finally ""quit"" my job - really don't care about that.  I just had to take care of my body and mind because it was falling apart.  (34m btw and now feel a lot older)

The longest I've been without anything is about 4 months now.  Even though I still honestly have to use one or two 3x a week to get everything done even around my house...it is getting easier.  I was also drinking a lot during that time so obviously stopping that has helped.  I just thought oh it's so common and these offices that run on adderall and alcohol (it is) but it fucked me up and stop/taper as soon as you can.  They will try and give you concerta or straterra (for me was worthless) klonopin and xanax for the unbearable anxiety that arises without dopamine/norepinephrine but will go away, and ambien (worst) for the insomnia (which after you finally get out of bed by week 2-3 will become a huge issue in itself).

I agree that it's more than the 1 year everyone says.  I'm just hoping my sort prefrontal and temporal brain function rebounds in the next year.  The right kind of food and supplements absolutely work (DM for list some are hard to find).  Obviously exercise and just being outside.  But I do still have that shell of a person feeling and lost interest in everything nihilism.  Generall still feel stupider, illogical, and temperamental than I was before.

Part of getting older I guess but yeah man hang in there.  It would shock you how many people I know once you hit 30-31 this has happened to in many (every) industries -  especially LA.  You just can't live that way more than a decade and taking maybe a month or whatever off from a job will pay dividends vs. crashing and burning.

Get a new doc and if they say you need vyvanse + any amt of ""extra umph"" adderall walk out the door (ambien or xanax run!) 70mg Vyvanse alone used to work on me back in the day 8 years ago - work appropriate and less...trucker methy than generic IR.  Might be the answer (1x day) but they definitely stop at some point.

Best advice:  Admit everything to you general doctor first or a family member so they can (I had to call my doc and left a vmail and an email at a low moment to tell him bc I knew I would just keep going back or doc shop as I usually would).  In California they can put notes on the state prescription database not to fill anything for you which is great.

Modafinil might be an end solution idk about to try it but have heard good/great things.

It basically started 10 days before my period and lasted up to 10 days after its end, so pretty much 3 weeks. But it was never completely off either, and it’s very food-related. 
I didn’t believe in it at first either and first only half-heartedly tried for like 6 weeks. The stress and good factors also made me believe it wasn’t relevant. But in the end it did work and I’m so relieved now and so glad I don’t have to live in pain, can do sport and eat a lot of food (even though I still have some issues, it’s much better).

ADHD inhibits me from doing the things I *want* to do. It puts up roadblocks between the desire to do something, and the physical act of actually doing it. (Best one-sentence explanation of Executive Dysfunction I can manage at the moment).


If you are being productive now that you have meds, that only means that the roadblocks have been removed. 


Meds don't magically imbue you with this desire to do stuff- You've been wanting to do them all along! You just had to deal with roadblocks that most people don't have to deal with. 


If you were truly lazy, meds wouldn't help you. You would feel better, but that would be the end of it. 

Does that mean you were broken before? I guess it kind of does. Your brain was ""broken"" by being filled up with unnecessary roadblocks. But that doesn't say anything about your character.


That would be like someone who can't walk finally getting a wheelchair, and then feeling bad about not being able to get around before they had it. Were they lazy? No. And if they are, having an chair won't make them any more mobile.","eilvy8e",1,1552675437,"2019-03-15 18:43:57"

It is only recently, after my diagnosis , that we are understanding how to cope with the way I am and how to work it with the way he is. 

I completely understand what you mean by sprinters, I always did well with courses that had projects in them or coding or problem solving projects, but, theory based subjects were my achilles heel. I get this high from finishing something, so more recently I have started diving things down in small chunks , this way I can feel good about small accomplishments. Given this I am worried that the research part of it might be something I am good at, but, the writing part is what really scares me. 

The doc diagnosed me with depression which caused ADHD to get worse. The meds he has given don't help much with ADHD symptoms , my hope is that I have a year to figure out what are best meds for me.

I really resonate with what you said about feedback and recognition. I thrive in a supportive environment. I do well in places where people give me time to really understand what's going on. I just lose all confidence if someone is negative and just end up doing worse than I would have otherwise. That's why I feel the fast paced corporate environment did not work for me.

"6274","I'm not sure about the effect it has on my ADHD because I began taking it on top of my stimulants (Wellbutrin 300mg, Adderall XR 30mg, Adderall IR 30mg) but it has helped me in ways that I can't even pinpoint.
I started with 150mg for around 3 months and didn't really feel any change, but when I increased to 300mg it clearly effected me positively. I have noticed that I'm less irritated with little things, more sociable, depression has dissipated, anxiety has almost completely vanished. I just feel like a person for the first time in my life. 
After over 2 years of trial and error, this combination of meds is working for me and Wellbutrin has helped tremendously in what I want to call ""wiping the slate clean"" so all my mood disorder crap gets brushed out of the way and my stimulants can do their job.

Maybe since adderall is bad for PTSD symptoms, try Ritalin instead. It had a more euphoric effect which I found distracting, but could be helpful in your case.

I was just thinking I wanted to try this. 
I need to get back on welbutrin, but since I know it doesn't help as much as I need I wanted to try a stimulant added to it. 

Adderall made me feel very spread thin at high doses but was a little helpful at low doses. Very angry too, which is probably an expression of my anxiety. I don't have hyperactivity, mostly a lack of motivation and ""depression""(the closest word to describe whatever it is).

Ssri's and ssni's(effexor) are something I avoid now. They leave me feeling empty, not calm, and have bad side effects that last after stopping, like lowering your ability to enjoy things, which increases the empty feeling.","dbsd66a",1,1483080991,"2016-12-30 06:56:31"

"6329","Forgot to mention -- classes are boring, so that is why Doctors believe the 'self-diagnosis ADHD' is usually a quick way for a study drug or to abuse it. He saved you (from 'not' getting real help) and saved himself. Trouble focusing in class, is usually because the patient is bored. 

I've seen firsthand on what a stimulant could do, and I'm glad you are receiving better care. I've seen a friend pass out when she messaged me for Medical Advice on diluting the CRAZY amount of Adderall she took. She was in counseling for a year, and is now drug free. I've seen brain damage due to normal amounts of a stimulant. Again, these patients were not receiving any therapy. They simply went to their GP, and it was easily given. Those Doctors (and I PROMISE you), are not the one's you want to go to. 

Don't screw around with drugs. You mention exams and school... you are too young. 

Find other threads on Reddit and elsewhere, where they mention side effects and poor dosage amounts. Most of them are 'GP Patients' and are not dealing with a Mental Health Professional. You don't need the side effects, and you are tired of the disorder. Therefore, you want something long-term. You want to see a Psychiatrist, who will make sure they diagnose you properly (ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, or Compulsivity Disorders) and get you medical treatment (small dose to help you focus on things, ONLY if the disorder gets in the way of daily functioning) and cognitive treatment. 

If you go to the Psychiatrist, and tell them you have problems at home, and it gets in the way of normal activities, you will then be prescribed medication. Do not take my Medical Profession and use it against them. If it doesn't get in the way of daily tasks, then don't mention it. 

But to really receive medication for anything, we make sure patients are truly struggling to do mundane tasks both at school, home, and work. :)","cl9whoj",0,1413350473,"2014-10-15 05:21:13"

The way I see it my bad decisions are usually impulsive, if I spent more time on them they would seem bad and I like to imagine I wouldn't pursue them. That's the filtering part. On the other hand, the good decisions wont be ejected from memory after initially being discarded, so they stay in your mind until you finally realize that yes, this is probably the correct call, which is what I attribute to a more consistent memory.

Some comments seem to think of those without ADHD as more robotical in their decisionmaking, but I think everyone suffers from the same shitty decisionmaking, it's just that they are more equipped to sort out the bad ones from the good ones and acting on them. I know the phrase ""We're all a little ADHD sometimes"" is pretty fucking annoying and hurtful, but there is a grain of truth (under the mound of bullshit) in that statement.","deep5un",2,1488449847,"2017-03-02 10:17:27"

Your body can't function without fue, and while the meds can trick you into thinking you're not hungry and don't need to eat or that you're amped up and ready to work out, your body still needs fuel. Don't use them to diet thinking you're workouts won't suffer. Also be very mindful of mixing caffeine with your meds. Caffeine plus meds can max out your heartrate/BP, giving your body no play to go if you exercise so it redlines on mild exercise. *Either* caffeine *or* meds if you're going to work out.

You can't safely override your body's limits, all you're doing is putting your body in a state where it's done a hard work out on no fuel *before* you even get to the gym, because it's been running in overdrive all day and has no reserves for working out.

"6345","Great question, and I want to start by saying we do not have a patent on addiction treatment, behavioral/mental health, etc. Our way works, but we realize that it is not the only way to cope and recover or cope with issues such as ADHD. Speaking on behalf of the treatment center along with some personal experience, I find that life can be overwhelming for just about anyone if you don't tackle each task by itself. Multi-tasking to me is somewhat of a myth, and I am not the only one that believes in this theory. It is possible to do, however it is much less effective than paying attention to one thing at a time. With that said, that is probably the root of the issues with ADHD. I personally tend to look to deep into things and too far into the future and when I begin to think about all that needs to be done, I become overwhelmed, stressed and develop some nasty anxiety and even a nasty attitude. This is what we like to refer to in AA as a spiritual malady (the state of being restless, irritable, and/or discontent). So, my best piece of advice, even though it is simple is to #1 have a game plan and #2 stick to the game plan, one task at a time!

"6394","Good for you for overcoming any stigma against it so young. I got all the way through college (majored in a foreign language, which apparently naturally capitalized on my ADD-related gifts), worked full-time, and then got halfway through law school before I realized why everything except math and learning languages was so difficult for me up to then. It wasn't until I had a 150-page per night homework load in law school that I realised other people don't read many paragraphs more than once or twice. Also in my writing I saw that I have difficulty weighing which section is more important than another--a very important skill when you're writing legal arguments. This is also related to ADD, my doctor said; many things often seem equally important. Somehow when she told me that, it became much easier for me to accept it and, without stress or harsh self-judgment, invent a kind of workaround for my brain.

So I would suggest you read up about it. Reading other people's experiences will help you distinguish what parts of your behavior are related to the ""illness"" and with a little more self-awareness its much easier to kind of train yourself. For example when Susan Cain's book [Quiet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet:_The_Power_of_Introverts_in_a_World_That_Can%27t_Stop_Talking) came out I realized that silence would help me when feeling overstimulated. So I found little places around my life to retreat for half an hour to complete silence when I needed to. I've felt so much better since I started doing this. No anger, no freakouts. Little things like that. 

Anyway, don't worry, you'll get the hang of it :) Just remember to reach out to people for support whenever you need it and you'll be fine.","cune7iw",2,1441138929,"2015-09-01 20:22:09"
"6395","Well, things CAN be different. But a) it takes time, and b) the medicine won't do it all.

You now have a tool that you can use to do better. You need more tools, though. Are you seeing a therapist? I used to poo-poo it but man, seeing one has really helped my self-talk. It's going to be hard for you to do well if you keep feeling like you hate yourself! Try to be kind to yourself.

How about study schedules? We can't really study like non-ADHDers. Try studying 5 mins at a time at first. That's it. Just 5 mins. Then take a 5 min break. Then 5 mins again. Each 5 mins focus on just ONE part of the problem you're trying to solve.

Beating your head off the table as you force yourself to try to comprehend a problem is just going to be counterproductive. It'll actually make it harder to learn.

Perhaps make a checklist of common errors you make, and before you consider a problem 'done,' check your checklist. Also, have you tried Khan Academy? Lots of exercises on there.

Rather than trying more more more on math, though, I recommend relaxing. You don't need tips on math, you need tips on relaxing, breathing, settling down, being calm. Easier said than done, I know, but things will go so much easier for you when you remember learning is a journey.

Us ADHDers do great with routine. So make your problem solving method a routine. Like, step 1 -- rewrite problem. Step 2 -- check to make sure you rewrote it accurately. Step 3 -- am I really sure?? Step 4 -- what sort of problem is this? What is this problem testing me on? Step 5 -- start to solve. Etc., etc. If it's truly an ingrained routine, you'll be much less likely to make the sort of arithmetic errors you're describing. You're not making them because you don't understand math; you're making them likely because you're skipping steps in the process, and then getting flustered and skipping more steps. So write those steps down! And do them over and over until you can say them in your sleep!

Lastly, don't beat yourself up for getting practice problems wrong. If you get a question right on the first try, it means you already knew it. Obviously you won't already know everything you're learning, so you are 100% guaranteed to get practice problems wrong. That's how learning works!

Just breathe, friend. You won't die if you fail. Just give it your best and be kind!","d0gotno",1,1456644626,"2016-02-28 07:30:26"

"6421","No. If you take it once or twice a week you won't have a steady amount of the drug inside your system. Basically the best way I can describe it is that taking it daily to find a correct dose is fast. 

Say if you're writing a log on growing strawberries, but the strawberries are growing once or twice a week. There's no development any of the off days (each day you take a med you grow and learn, each day you take a med the strawberry plant grows) 

If you take it daily the strawberries will grow and you'll find the correct way to grow them. 

To sound blunt, your way of thinking about this is absolutely wrong. You have to find the right dose, so use it daily with a day or two break. If you're taking it once or twice you won't progress.

I know that I go through periods of feeling ok but then have 'depression episodes' pretty frequently. I would say if it would give you peace of mind, try to get a second opinion. Bipolar and adhd show up differently in different people. I certainly have never experienced the true mania of Bipolar 1. 

My therapist keeps telling me that if the meds are working to not question my diagnosis. I ended up going off all my meds at the same time for a period of 10 months and then absolutely lost my mind. I felt extremely overstimulated and was very irritable and pretty much unable to do literally anything for a few days. I went back on mood stabilizers and I haven't felt that way since.

"6467","I think the only thing we can really do is take meds, and just sort of work around our adhd or channel some of it. 

Like, finding a way to find stimulation in something productive. I think in the right job or with the right hobbies, that need for stimulation can become less of an obstacle. It's never going to be easy, or go away permanently. But I think ADHD symtoms can sometimes be worked with a bit if u set up your routines and limit the sort of environment you expose yourself to. 

It's more like a really temperamental but highly competant horse. Maybe he won't always take you the route you want but if you set out from the right spot, he can take you over terrain you didn't think possible. If your set out on a route that has many diverging paths though, his prideful ass will want to take probably any other path. 

Like as adhd people I think we tend to use the whole on ourselves, emotionally speaking. But often I think it's better to let our adhd do its thing, but just set things up so that the things our adhd wants to get up to, benefits us more than hurts us.

That's sort of my approach right now. Still figuring it out, but","g36j1sc",1,1598652097,"2020-08-28 22:01:37"

"6516","Your post really spoke to me.
I was diagnosed at a young age so I was fortunate enough to receive treatment for most of my life. But medication does not at all “fix” everything. At age 15 I started to realize that I was somehow different from the people around me. It didn’t really click that this was probably because of my ADHD. It’s not even that these differences are inherently bad, but they made me feel out of place.
On top of that I just kept battling the ADHD symptoms and entirely wrong so. I just kept putting myself down because I failed to do what others could do so easily. I didn’t even realize that these failures were connected to my ADHD.
I actually got a lot of anxiety and a... I’d say mild case of depression because I felt  everything in my life was going “wrong”. 
And then when I discovered the wikipedia article about depression in ADHD individuals I started crying because I felt my life suddenly made sense again.

I think the most important thing I learned is to accept myself as a messy person. That doesn’t mean I’m not still working on myself, but when I do mess up I am much kinder with myself. I always had this sense that I need to figure it all out and looked for happiness somewhere else, but not where I was. Once I learned to accept myself for who I was, the loud, annoying, messy, impulsive, hyperactive, talkative, creative, passionate girl that I was, it was as if a curse had been lifted off my shoulders.

I don’t really know where I’m going with this (an ADHD specialty), but I guess I hope that a diagnosis will not only help you bring some positive change into your life, but also acceptance for all the little and big things that will inevitably go wrong in your life.","e7j3a6j",3,1539198420,"2018-10-10 19:07:00"

And the thought thing, I totally do that too. I'll interrupt people because I'm afraid I'm going to lose what I wanted to say before they're done.

I feel like all authority figures should lead by example, and if they don't, then why should I listen to them?

"6523","They legalized it some time ago here. It seems to help with some severe cases. Now in lots of ADHD groups there are many people who totally advertise it as a miracle cure and others looking for the easiest way to get it. 

I don't get many of those people either. Mostly they only tried one stimulant which didn't work or had the usual side effects and so they don't want to try other medication (because obviosly cannabis is plant based so smoking it can't have side effects and only targets ADHD symptoms while taking specifically developed ADHD medication only has side effects and does not treat ADHD at all \s. Sadly I'm not making this up).  

I don't know why they do this. If they were looking for medication just seeing a psychiatrist and trying standard medication would be a lot easier and cheaper and helps most people.  
If they were looking for legal drugs, buying it illegally or growing it also seems easier and cheaper. And our drug laws are not that restrictive so you don't get into bad trouble for just owning/smoking small amounts.  
But getting a permission for medical cannabis is complicated and can take a lot of time and then buying it isn't easy either and it's expensive and you have to pay all of it yourself.

As usual people react to it differently. There are people who say it helps and they seem to mostly have severe problems with racing disorganized thoughts and not so many other problems so this actually fits your description pretty well. 

I for example can't understand what other people say about the effects of methylphenidate. Apart from the usual physical side effects I react the opposite way to most people. It makes me nice and social and helps a lot against anxious thoughts but does not help or even worsens ADHD symptoms. Which would be okay if I had an anxiety disorder or depression but is not the intended effect in my case.

"6565","It can take multiple days before you feel the full effect because of several reasons:

- You're still set in your old ways, it'll take a couple of situations where you actually notice a difference in your behavior;
- Amphetamine based meds take a few days to reach peak level in your blood. You start each day with a certain amount of meds left in your system. After a few days (~5 ish i'd say) you'll reach equilibrium where you add as much as you're losing due to metabolism.
- Stressful times in life can make it harder to really notice the difference meds make. Stressful times will stay stressful. It's the times where you normally can't calm down even though there's nothing to stress about where they shine.

Tip: Don't tell your doc it did nothing, I recommend being a bit more meh about it like ""Can't really say I noticed a difference"". Straight up saying ""It did absolutely nothing"" could make her more suspicious.

Try thinking of something you normally really cannot do. For me for example it'd be reading a book or writing down something. Do that an hour or two after you've taken the meds, and see if you notice a difference in how long you can manage it.","dsfam8z",3,1515518626,"2018-01-09 17:23:46"

"6578","After many years of marriage I still struggle with this.  It's ruined a lot for me over the years.

I'll try to answer your points one by one.

1. Make stuff **easier to put away than it is to get out.**  Have bins you can toss stuff into.  I use a bunch of sterlite bins and plano boxes, clearly labeled so I can find what I need later.  Need to clean up?  Just toss everything in the correct bin.  Need to get something out?  Go find the bin, open it, and look through it until I lose interest and go do something else.  Create a barrier to impulsivity.

2. For cleaning, **make a game of it.**  I have a stack of cards with jobs on it, draw a card, and do a job.  Or I play a game I like to call ""Put ten things away.""  Not twenty not fifty, ten.  If I try to put twenty things away I'll wind up doing something else halfway through.

3. **Buy headphones and use them.**  If you need to walk around, then load some shows onto an ipod or your phone or something and listen to those.  Yes you won't be able to talk while you're deep in work but when you're deep in work I somehow suspect you might not be the best listener anyway.  Let him watch what he wants, since he actually wants to watch TV, and you don't.  For you, if a show was actually interesting enough to you to want to watch it, you wouldn't have it on, because it would distract you.  

4. Okay, the Etsy thing: Are you constantly working, or are you working, getting distracted for half an hour, then working some more?  I suspect it's the latter.  I also suspect the frenzy fuels you, since the adrenaline of an impending deadline lets you ignore your ADHD for a while.  **Schedule some time for him.**  Maybe it's just 2 hours a night, that's all about you as a couple.  (During super-busy time, is 2 hours a night too much time together?  My pregnant wife doesn't think so.  It doesn't matter how busy I am I make a chunk of time for her nightly.   Maybe you're lucky and your BF needs less time.)   Anyway, you'll wind up losing more distracted time than than you will productive frenzy time, since now your deadlines will be two hours closer.  Of course, don't be afraid to cut them off as you near the two-hour mark.  But do treat your SO like they are a priority, or they will see that they aren't one.  (While you're at it, **schedule some time to exercise, too**, even just a half hour a day.)

5. He will constantly need to adapt to you.  But guess what?  YOU will constantly need to adapt to you also.  Maybe you do some stuff he loves, (or why is he with you?)  but also maybe you do some stuff that's intolerable.  (No one is perfect and we have a disorder.)   There is going to need to be a compromise.  **Use the power of talking**  to find out what's the biggest deal to each of you, then work something out.  For example my wife was frustrated over how I did the dishes, and was tired of doing them herself, but then she found she could have all the dishes put away where she wanted them if she would just put labels up on the cabinets.   It sounds kindergarden-y, but otherwise I'm going to put the dishes someplace that makes sense to me but is crazy to everyone else.  Anyway, talk it out and figure out your respective priorities.

This is how I have to learn everything, and it's a huge problem sometimes. I used to work in oil refineries, and nobody could tell me any small amount of information without me needing to have the entire fucking process explained from beginning to end.

ADHD is a mental disability. Just like autism. So saying you were being soooooo ADHD yesterday when you where cleaning the house. You can't just turn off a mental disability.

I might go with the cripple route. Instead of autism.

That way I had a visual guide and time became distance and I just had to tackle one thing at time.

I can understand how completely exhausting it can be for someone like that to live with a person who has very little control over her emotions. I try hard to keep them inside, but sometimes I can't help reacting over nothing and seeing that it has so much impact on him makes me even more emotional. It's a vicious cercle.

He feels like he's done everything to make me happy, and it didn't work, because I'm still as emotional as when he met me and with little motivation. He's encouraged me to do this job, which is the one I want to do. But normally people who engage in this kind of self entrepreneurial jobs are very dedicated. I don't look like I am, unless there's a deadline and hyperfocus strikes. He had to make sacrifices for me to do this job, so it gives him a big sense of loss, which is understandable. I love my job and I'm very lucky to have it. If I didn't love it, I wouldn't even be able to work at all. But apparences are against me.

It's the same with people. It's all about how it looks. For him, if I loved my job or if I was interested in people, it would look differently. I can't blame him for thinking that way but it's a way to look at things very hard to fight: I say I love my job, he says that all the apparences lead to think that it's not the case, so why wouldn't he think that I fool myself?

The problem is you're being disingenuous. But why? Why are you picking teams for something that shouldn't have teams? Logic, my friend. Cold, hard, mathematical logic is all you need. So let me analyze this study FOR YOU. 

""Twelve months of methylphenidate treatment increased striatal dopamine transporter availability in ADHD (caudate, putamen and ventral striatum: +24%, p&lt;0.01);""
For those of you who aren't aware of how percentages work, especially when it comes to chemical balances, a 24% increase is ginormous. You should know that Dekarch is lying to you when he says this isn't a noticeable difference. a 2% change is enough to throw off any equilibrium, and this is something anyone with an AP chemistry course in highschool would know. You're playing with people's lives when you say these things. People are going to read your responses blinded by the reality of stimulants.

however, like anything it gets better with practice, you have to get out and get involved with things that your interested in, the social life will come along for the ride.  Remember everyone struggles with this, not just people with ADHD, it just may be more common for us. And, if all else fails try to organize one of the reddit get together things where people from the same area and subreddit meet at a public place or something?

It wasent great for my health or my waist line but when I was single going for beer and wings with coworkers after work is a pretty good route, picking a bar with a wing night special also helps, then its not so bad if you want to offer to pay,  everyone loves a free drink or two, just don't pay every time.","cjvj90s",1,1408543892,"2014-08-20 14:11:32"

"6650","There is a book called Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain from Ratey (the guy who co-wrote Driven to Distraction). It sets out to explain what kind of exercise is best for the brain. It can get sciency but it is still a good read.

Here's the deal if I remember correctly:

* Strength training only affects mood, how you percieve others blabla. So it doesn't improve your learning ability, memory, your thinking ability in general. 

* Cardio affects not only mood but it also improves general thinking ability, memory etc.

* Exerice that forces you to make complex movements or balancing acts further improves your ""brainpower"". Apparently there is a part of your brain that doesn't get the benefits from just cardio alone so you need to do complex sports like dancing, martial arts, yoga, skateboarding, mountain climbing etc. to get those extra benefits. This study was done on rats so take the results as you will.

* Very high intensity training (I guess they mean maximum strength training) doesn't necessarily make you feel better and in some cases participants feel worse after this kind of training (hey, I'm just the messenger, it says so in the book). I guess you'll just have to try it out and see how you feel after this.

* Sprinting, while being horrifically excruciating, can be awesome for your brain. It just sucks that it's usually fucking brutal. This is not for people who doesn't like a challenge or puke.

That's the gist of it really, but if you want an in-depth explanation read the book. It takes a bit to get its point across but it's still worth the read. Maybe I forgot a few details, but whatever. Hope it comes in handy.","c595drw",1,1341366165,"2012-07-04 01:42:45"

There is a ridiculous problem on this planet. It makes me sick every time I hear or see another case like this. When it comes to mental health, YOU are the only person who knows what’s functionally going on inside YOUR head. The only valid people in life will actually help you work with whatever you know is holding you back, not make you feel like it’s something to be ashamed of. Not like it’s something to necessarily be proud of either! But anyone else out just for themselves and their own beliefs is going to jump down your throat whether they have good general intentions or not.

There’s a point where you can believe something, with or without someone else’s validation, where your entire being can be happy and satisfied knowing that your own faith is remaining strong. That’s part of why the function and state of believing exists in the first place.

The imbalance and problem happens when others want to disrupt that state of being for whatever reason they may possess, where they feel they can just do that. That is generally just stuff that will end up in unwanted noise, opinions, challenges and interference for you, but they know by throwing those harsh judgements at you like “ADHD is not a thing,” you won’t improve past a point they don’t want you to pass until you kind of “push” your way through.

As soon as I know what I need to do (essay, report, whatever) I bring up Word and write the title. Then I leave it in the background. I'll be thinking about how much I need to do it, no doubt - but  I won't feel like doing it. It's there, though, waiting for me. Now, as soon as I have 30 seconds spare - I might be waiting for a loading screen, or for a video to buffer, or for dinner, whatever - I can flick to it, type out a few words or a couple of sentences, give it a little thought, and then go back to whatever I was doing.


This way, it *does* get done - little by little. And the more the page gets filled up, the less daunting completing it feels. Eventually, I'll get into the swing of it and be able to finish my [essay]. The best part of this is that, occasionally, I'll forget I was doing anything else and I'll find myself so absorbed in the work that I end up managing to do a great big chunk all in one go.

"6678","Texas has a huge shortage of psychiatrists especially now that Obamacare plans have so many limitations on them. Personally my psychiatrist is actually a nurse practitioner but she's specialized and authorized to write scripts and works under a psychiatrist doctor. (Same office). She's so much more laid back and allows me to be completely upfront about everything in my life. 

I guess my main advice is 1) Find a better doc ASAP and/or, if you had a great reputation at your Virginia doc, call them and ask their advice. 

I got drug tested inappropriately once by a PCP and it's not in any records because I never mention it to other docs because I felt it was totally irrelevant and provided no helpful info. I just immediately resolved to change PCP doc. So, hopefully don't get records from this new bad doc sent over to whatever you do next. It's probably best to be honest and get all records sent over but you have to weigh the risk of being judged over THC. We all know that having THC should not be relevant at all except doc should have given you more help instead of taking it away. 

Personally I can't stand marijuana because it makes me have panic attacks and I already get panic attacks while sober lol but no judgement here. Perhaps if you brought it up under the context of ""I want to stop"" then it might be seen differently? Best of luck!","d3i7087",3,1464122747,"2016-05-24 20:45:47"

"6687","Yup, it sucks. I'm not terrified, more like resigned and extremely bitter about it. I like my job (I'm an accountant, I'm detail oriented and I love math so it's great), but having to get up at 7am every day is torture and by the time I get home I'm so mentally exhausted that it's not worth the effort of trying to do hobby stuff for the 2~3 hours I have free before bedtime. Then the weekend hits and it's so hard to motivate myself to work on any personal projects because I know I'm going to need energy conserved to make it through the next work week and budgeting energy is something I have always been awful at, so again, it's like, why bother trying?  The amount of energy it takes to start a task and hit your flow is massive, and once you do hit your flow you only have 2 days to work on the ting before you're going to have to set it aside for a week when you will, of course, completely forget to come back to it. 

My job is 10 hrs/4 days instead of 8/5, and you'd *think* that'd be amazing because hey, permanent 3-day weekends! But it turns out that's just enough to recover my energy deficit completely by the time Monday rolls around. Not enough time to get into surplus and actually get non-work shit done. I mean, it's definitely better than the process of slow burnout that comes with trying to maintain a 5-day work week for months on end, but it still means work dominates my life in a way it shouldn't. All my time is either work, commuting to/from work, minimum personal upkeep, and recovering from work. There's no time/energy left for what *I* want to be doing with my life.

And as someone who would much rather be writing novels, I've basically had to resign myself to knowing that I will never be able to finish anything for publication until I'm finally retired and can write without having to worry about ""earning a living"".

If you want to use them most effectively, you have to want to use them effectively.....  Does that make sense?

So, yes, to do lists, reminders posted places.  I'll leave things I need to put places in my way - like if I need to remember to take something out to the car I'll put it in front of my door.  Or I'll leave out paperwork I need to do on top of my keyboard.  It's all about finding out how you work best, what keeps the important stuff in front of you.  It's okay to take a break from the big stuff though and focus on the little things.  You just need a system in place to make sure you get back to the stuff you really need to do.  Experiment, find your flow.  It's there.  If something doesn't work, immediately discard it and try something different.  Don't get hung up on any one method if it's not working for you.

* The Four Hour Workweek
* Early Retirement Extreme
* Your Money or Your Life
* The $100 Startup
* The Boglehead's Guide to Investing

I used to fall asleep *all the time* in class and have often fallen asleep while working, or even driving when I get bored.

"6724","Age: 23

Profession: Student (Bioengineering Major) and I have a side job doing housework for an elderly retired professor.

Hobbies you do: Video games, cooking, comics, reading, thinking about learning stuff.

Hobbies you plan to do: Robotics, CAD design, programming, drawing, painting, fitness stuff. Probably more, but that's all I remember right now.

Hobbies you plan to learn: All of the stuff from the previous section, basically. Oh, and screen printing and sewing. Just remembered those.

Hobbies that you are learning: Fixing stuff. Like just general home repair. Jeezy Petes I fucking love fixing shit. Also computer building.

Your struggles: Holy fuck why did I ever decide to do summer courses and work at the same time. I am exhausted, always, and I have neglected so much. I work my fucking hardest and I only ever get like 60% of all the shit I need to do done. Why can't I be good enough? Why am I so shit? Also struggling to keep my weight up. I've been underweight/low end of healthy weight my entire life, and only just before I was diagnosed did I hit a BMI of 25 (mostly due to ridiculous bouts of binge eating). Then I got on meds, and now if I don't force feed myself, my weight plummets. I had to calculate how low I could go before I would be clinically underweight so I could stay above it so they wouldn't stop my meds. Every time I see my family, they immediately start harping on me to eat more, which just makes me want to eat less. And then my mom and my grandma told me my ass looked flabby and now I just feel super ugly all the time.

Edit: Oh oh and I can't wake up in the morning. It's super frustrating, because I know I need to get up, but it's almost impossible. I tried setting an alarm and taking my meds before I needed to be up, but all that did was make me nauseous, which made me lose weight, which just piled on top of Stress Mountain.","ctdzqk3",2,1437695652,"2015-07-23 23:54:12"

And then I'm always making lists like ""stuff to take to sisters house"".   I'll start the list,  add stuff to it, stop, get something to drink, check email and then remember I need to do laundry, but in the way to the washing machine I'll see a jar of capers and think ""what's that recipe I liked with the capers an cauliflower?"",  and then I'll end up researching Michael Symon's recipes, find what I need, then find some other shit on YouTube about car parts and then remember ""the tire pump!!

Yes routines are also very easy to maintain, I have a routine that I have been buliding with Google Calendar and Todoist and I shared a  [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/u89KA6X.png) on one of the comment I made. It's a huge work in progress as these are tools that I have never used in the past.

Like you, before medication this would have been an impossible task, usually I would have spent three hours trying to find the right tool instead of just using one. Though it'st not effortless but it's very close from being effortless, the times where I don't follow with my planning is usually because I was doing something else that I planned but didn't account for how long it would take and got a few minutes late. 

My GP said to me that this would change my life and I completely agree with him, medication for people with ADD is essential for treatment, the reality of it is that it's not a question of willpower. We need this to function correctly. In the morning when the medication has no effect I'm not really in control of my thoughts (but I'm not depressed at least) and I don't have the focus that I have during the day so I started the habit of noting the time of when I take the medication otherwise I'll forget I took it, I don't want two dose haha!

"6804","&gt; Sure, i might experience euphoria and emotional well-being the first few days on the medication, but that wears off quickly because tolerance is a thing with ADHD drugs. This could only lead to me getting worse than before i started the drug.

I think that you've really misunderstood what happens here. Read the link &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thataway about medication. If you don't want to read all of it (I get it, I zoned out) just Ctrl-F your way to the section called *Tolerance*.

Hell, I'll just copy and paste it for you myself. Somebody did for me the other day and it made me sit up and think about things.

&gt; Tolerance is unlikely to be an issue at therapeutic dosages. It's really only an issue for those abusing the medication or who are 'chasing the rush'.

&gt; For the rest of us, tolerance is a perception that a stimulant medication becomes less effective after long-term use.

&gt; From what I've heard (from my doctor) there's not much chance of an actual 'tolerance.'

&gt; My conjecture is that it's more a change in the patient's perception:

&gt; Before medication your 'average' day feels like a 2/10, for example. Your first few days on the right medication feel like an 6/10 in comparison. This is a 4 point increase, or a 300% increase from your 'average'.

&gt; After you've been on your medication for a while, you start thinking your average day is a 6/10, and after you start realizing how much more you can get done, you raise your expectations of what a 10/10 would be like. So now, your 'good' days that you think are 'due to being medicated' only seem like a 8/10, which is 'only' a 33% percent increase.

&gt; Since people with ADHD tend to have unrealistically high expectations for themselves, they might feel bad that they're no longer experiencing that '300% increase'.

&gt; A better measure would be to realize that ""100%"" is superhuman, or impossible/unrealistic. **The pre-medicated state was 20% (which made ''me'' feel like 'slime'). The newly medicated state was 60%, or about average/realistic. An 80% state is phenomenally good day, well above average or ""reasonably to be expected.**""

In short, there's no reason why the initial ""rush"" and then drop should make you feel bad, if you anticipate it and plan for it.

I'll add this great advice from u/Aim_2_misbehave (on that first buzz of productivity from medication):

&gt; If you come home from work feeling like you have the focus and energy to clean the entire house and then go to the gym for 2 hours, try instead to set a time limit for a certain task and then take a break to reward the good behavior. [....] When you hit a bad day where it doesn't feel like your meds are working at all, there's no way that you're going to be able to clean the whole house / write a paper / whatever herculean task you've become accustomed to, but since you've trained your brain you probably will be able to do the 30 minutes of task X that you've gotten used to.","czrdipz",1,1454876978,"2016-02-07 20:29:38"

"6809","Thank you for your well wishes. I'm in fact MUCH better now, even though I'm still dealing with some emotional blunting and my mental capabilities are still somewhat messed up (mainly my memory consolidation and visual imagination).

Look, I'm not an proibitionist and I'm even less of a puritan, but what I've learned from my time exploring psychoactives is that none of them is harmless when made an habit. Maybe not because of the drug itself, but due to less time being (and enjoying being) in your normal mental states.
I tend to think of it as drinking, it is great when used sporadically (in fact, I do both ocasionally), but terrible when it's on your routine. Weed makes your memory and learning go downhill, is a HUGE waste of time and since it's an altered state of consciousness, whatever you achieve while on it is unlikely to be sustained while off of it.

From what you are describing, our experiences with it might be similar. For me at least, weed feels GREAT. It's the single thing in the world that gives me a lasting feeling of satisfaction and bliss. I really hope you can quit your abusing relationship with it... but I myself could never quit cold turkey. What I did instead was getting into a healthy relationship with it. If that interests you, give a try on super low doses and go up from there, while giving AT LEAST a couple days interval between uses. That might be enough to give a sporadic pleasure while not fucking your life up.

"6820","Hi. This just sucks and is clearly a complicated situation with many layers. (I am in my early 30's, was diagnosed with ADHD / depression by my therapist in my mid-twenties with the \[supportive\] urging of my former boss. My mom is also an early childhood educator and clearly has a form of ADHD but never has been formerly diagnosed). I also have trouble navigating highly political professional situations and it has gotten me in trouble in the past (and I work in creative environments, much less buttoned-up than a private school setting). 

&amp;#x200B;

**A few stray thoughts about your situation that you described above:**

&amp;#x200B;

• It seems that this has grown to be much bigger than you as an individual. From the principal's POV, their customer is the angry well-paid parent; [That is how almost every private school operates in the US these days](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/05/magazine/friends-new-york-quaker-school-ben-frisch-hitler-joke.html). *You are not alone* in the ""pissed-off the wrong person"" camp, just by doing your job. In that article I linked, the students are campaigning to bring the teacher back (it's the parents who forced the school to fire him). 

&amp;#x200B;

• If I had to guess, it sounds like 1. The parent threatened the principal to remove you as a teacher or something along those lines. 2. The principal worked quickly to hold on the record meetings to build grounds for your removal/punishment. 3a. During these meetings, the principal discovers the situation may not be as clear cut as they would have preferred. (AKA they should have read their friggin' email) 3b. I'm also guessing the principal did not like hearing 'blame' being shifted back in their direction in the middle of their attempt to discipline you. (There's a fine line between defending yourself and how you do your job vs 'appearing defensive'). It doesn't matter if you're in the right when you're communicating with a skittish boss.  

*Re: Defending yourself*: I Have BEEN there. I get it. I find that I have trouble letting inaccurate information go unaddressed mid-conversation; Which leads to me interrupting/[questioning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17978134-a-more-beautiful-question) the wrong people in the wrong conversation (even if it's done calmly and professionally, it still wildly pisses people off, especially if you're right). This usually happens with an authority figure, in front of other people or during a high stakes situation. The link I included talks about how even *the mere act of posing a question* isn't received well because it is interpreted as a challenge to authority. I'm still learning how to slow down my brain during these types of professional interactions. Forget it if you're articulate, confident, a woman/femme presenting and/or from *any* marginalized group, any of these just exacerbates the reactions (it doesn't matter who you're interacting with, biases exist within everyone even if they are from the same marginalized group). Honestly, I'm just trying to keep my mouth shut these days to keep myself out of trouble at work. 

 

• HIPPA laws are pretty iron clad in the US, (echoing others who have already commented) I have no idea how the school could legally break your doctor patient confidentiality. The only work around I can think of is child/student safety trumps employee rights? 

&amp;#x200B;

• Your health and well being comes first. If you feel threatened or unsupported in this professional environment and no longer wish to navigate it (that is what all educational environments are), move on to better things. The way you describe it, it sounds toxic. If leaving is not an option currently, become ultra familiar with your rights, strengthen your relationship with your union and leverage positive relationships you have cultivated with other parents, students and fellow teachers in case you ever need them to speak on your behalf. 

&amp;#x200B;

• In future situations, when you realize you have made a mistake (no matter how major or minor, like not getting coverage for your supervisory shift), BREATHE, take it seriously/apologize immediately (not ""I'm sorry"", but ""I apologize""). BREATHE, Actively listen to whoever is communicating the issue to you, BREATHE, ask sincerely how you can make it right, BREATHE, verbally commit to doing better. 

Saying anything outside of an apology sounds like excuses to the listener (again, it doesn't matter what the reality is if it's a professional situation involving power dynamics). With ADHD / emotions, sometimes I've stepped in it or was forgetful. I have found that standing still in the moment/breathing and owning up to my shit immediately deescalates everyone's emotions. It also softens their listening filter as they continue to hear your apology.

***Sidenote about being capable of calmly navigating these types of tough conversations***: I had a \*much\* easier time staying calm / regulating my emotions after I went on Welbutrin. Be patient with finding a method that works for you. It could be meds (the right type of med) or therapy or personal/professional support or [meditation](https://www.headspace.com/) or exercise or whatever your version of self care is.

I mostly just wanted to say, we still have problems, but the raging has calmed down a LOT with age. Very rarely get a floor tantrum. Still occasional crying. Now we have chronic whining and excessive talking about Roblox instead. Much easier to deal with. I like The Explosive Child book. I keep encouraging my husband to read up on ADHD.

A lot of books about ADHD delve into this and I am still working on it myself. One thing I have learned is that external forces shape my behavior more than internal. Need to clean the house? Invite people over. Also things that become habitual seem to be more likely to get done. Having a schedule and following it, going to bed at the same time etc. Medication makes a huge difference. We could write a book here, basically, a big help is getting started which is the hardest part. Try setting a timer and telling yourself I will do this thing for ten minutes. Then I can stop.

A good example of this for me is dance music with the same tune throughout, but building as it goes. I also get the head-nods and foot-taps in tune so it's REALLY soothing and I get loads done!

Try something out that you want to do and after a month or two, if it is still a hobby you want to pursue spend some more money/time doing it. 

As far as doing everything you want, I don't think it is possible. The more hobbies I try to do at a time, the more it feels like my leisure time is a second job. It's easier to just switch focus and let other activities take a back seat for a while.","cwuh6jz",2,1447100720,"2015-11-09 20:25:20"

"6884","Remember ADHD is real and yet people with ADHD go on to all kinds of amazing things. Being 11 years old is hard enough and when you add  ADHD, life can be extremely difficult. Untreated ADHD is linked to all kinds of problems include depression, anxiety, and low self esteem. Taking medication is not an indication that your kid is broken, or that you did something wrong.  

The goal of meds is to help the your kid take a few extra milliseconds to stop and think before they act. That's it. If it's making your kid act a different way or causing problems it's not right. 

Also do keep in mind that sometimes it takes a tiny bit of tinkering to get the exact medication and dosage right.  Be patient. Give it a few days before deciding if it's working or not.

"6892","""Hyperfocus"" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD.

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

I just want to second this. Interrupting people has been a major issue for me too, and doing things like this has helped me avoid some socially awkward moments when I interupt someone with a completely unrelated thought.  One thing that has helped me specifically is to repeat whatever the person is saying to me so that I can stay on track with what they're saying. Sometimes I'll do it my head as they're speaking or I'll try to rephrase what they said in my response when I do speak. It's not foolproof and I still get distracted, but I try to apologize when I do interupt which seems to help. 

I also think being open with people about your ADD/ADHD is helpful too if you're comfortable with it. After I told my friends and my coworkers about my diagnosis, they've seemed more patient with me.","esqiwi4",2,1562203396,"2019-07-04 01:23:16"
"6895","Hey man I'm really sorry to hear that, but you know what I know exactly how you're feeling right now to a certain extent. I've failed a total of 14!! classes and have been on academic probation at least twice. It is such a humiliating feeling and it is truly one of the hardest things I've had to deal with in my entire life. I really recommend that you take a semester off from school, maybe work a little, and find a way to just get your mind in a place that will help yourself and stop the self-sabotage. For me going to a few therapy sessions as well as getting the treatment has been a godsend for me and allowed me to finally get out of this cycle of self-sabotage. 

I'm really very sorry you're feeling this way and I know you feel like all of this is your fault, but our brains are so complex and unfortunately the people with our conditions have a few extra wires out of place that just makes it that much easier for us to screw ourselves out of achieving what we want to in life. Just know that whatever does happen your own mental health and overall well-being should be the most important thing for you, but it is unfortunately something we have to work our asses off to achieve. It requires a huge leap of faith to go to that first therapy session, or open up to a friend, or just a stranger on the internet. And that's something that a lot of times doesn't pan out the way we'd like, but it's something that **requires us to continue fighting for**. You might not believe in yourself right now just as I didn't believe in myself when I was in your spot, but the fact of the matter is that you can succeed, and you just have to fight like hell to get to that point. Life is a never ending struggle especially for us, but we can achieve our dreams. We absolutely can. Just never stop fighting for what you want in your life, because it is not fair for anyone to feel the way you're feeling currently. 

In the next week or so you'll likely receive your final grades and be immensely disappointed by the reminder that this semester was squandered away. Take a day to mourn, then when you wake up the next morning if those feelings remain, don't get sad, but get angry. Use that anger to motivate you to do what you need to do to succeed. Whether it's getting an appointment with a therapist, talking to friends or family and seeking advice, or any other thing you can think of that'll help you get to where you deserve to be. Life is way too short to squander and I have to remind myself that damn near every day. It is a constant struggle for us, but we need to keep fighting, because we deserve it.","fqs1mb0",1,1589596520,"2020-05-16 02:35:20"

"6911","I am so depressed because of my ADHD that I had to go to a psychiatrist to stop myself from being a useless sobbing whiner (I was devastated, collapsed in sadness and saw no way out). I was still taking rithalin, but the depression was so strong that I was doing things but feeling nothing. When the effect wore off, OMG, the comeback was awful. I just paralyzed.

This time was so different. I took rithalin for a period of time before (did this a few times) and everything was perfect (or normal, I guess). Calmed down, concentrated, did stuff, managed my ADHD symptoms and organized my life. But this time (I got involved in too much, so many responsibilities) I ended up being alone, overwhelmed by work, and pushed everyone away from me. Of course this made my life unbearable.

In the midst of an emotional breakdown, got some help and stop the stimulants and now I feel better. I'm currently treating the depression so I can get back on track and sort my way again on the ADHD.

In the meantime I ditched all my bad habits. I stopped eating any sugar (sucrose) or anything sweet besides fruits, (I was obese and had compulsion for sweet things) and stopped watching porn (totally addicted for years and years). This made me feel much less compulsive. Now that I'm treating the depression, I feel much better about the ADHD too. I feel like I threw away all the expectations I had for myself and now I want to study myself and rebuild my life with it, step by step.

I deal by asking myself: what specifically do I fear about the task? It's often that it's big, I don't know where to start and I think about all the parts at once and can't focus on one. It can be other reasons, like fear of failure. But be very, very specific.

Once you've got it, you probably notice there are also good or easy parts about the task. But the most important thing is that when you have specific problems, you can solve them. Too big? Divide and conquer. Don't know where to start? The first sub-task is to plan a list of sub-tasks. Fear of failure? Think what would make this task well done, like what would get you a good grade - I bet worrying and putting it off is not on the list. ;)

It's okay to fear a task - it's just a feeling. Just be specific and then address the specific issues.

"6930","Agree100% and here’s one dudes opinion on the matter:  Like some other folks on this thread, I believe that all of our hyper-sensitivities to changes in our physical environment (do you hear that? Wait, somethings off here...etc) are what kept us in the evolutionary gene pool. 

I think it’s the reason why so many of us thrive as entertainers and salespeople and I think our many sensitivities make it extremely difficult to perform the rote tasks and understand the nuanced communications necessary to succeed in a hierarchical corporate environment. 

Consolidation of manufacturing and merchandising into a corporate structure robs the quirky yet successful individual from performing job duties within a small business where the governing structure is flatter. 

That’s Bob, he’s crazy, but he’s our best ______” Bob might lose his shit once a year, but at a small business where the owner knows him, he keeps his job, where at corporation, a stranger evaluates his behavior against a generic code of conduct and he is fired. 

If you have confirmed with a doctor (MD as well as PHD to be on the safe side) that you have ADHD, it is very important to look at all aspects of your lifestyle and find out where you are falling short because of your symptoms. 

Once you have these symptoms identified, select a lucky volunteer to confirm where you are fucking up. They will first be annoyed but eventually they will understand you are coming to them because you want to change or at least because you are looking more closely at your mistakes and generally people will be willing to help.

Next, you will use your ADHD charm, wit, humor and warmth to enlist them as a coach. Don’t let them in on this and don’t ever talk to them about this new relationship, just focus on not screwing them over and recording or noting your successes and your failures.

Coaching is critical because a physician or psychiatrist is not trained to help you create systems for success and it’s only through these systems that you will find calm, peace of mind and the ability to gather your thoughts in a constructive way to focus on your larger goals. 

Finding a professional coach is difficult in my experience (3 coaches/therapists so far) because they charge hundreds of dollars and want to counsel you instead of address the systems you need to succeed. This is why I am advocating using your own people as coaches. If you think about it, neurotypicals function this way without a problem, we should follow their lead here. 

We get all wrapped up in varying layers of self-absorption, concern, anger, fear that we may not view our relationships on this basic level:
Be on time. Be present. Be involved. Care about others. For ADHDers it is more difficult to participate in life on this primal, basic level which is why everyone is so pissed at us all the time. 

By finding a hobby or job that lets us do our thing, we can participate in the day to day. Without an outlet for our super powers we will continue to get banged around and not really be comfortable with ourselves!!

"6931","Yup, I'd encourage you to schedule a second feedback session to try to hear again what your doctor was trying to say.  I regularly offer a follow-up feedback session for just this reason.  We do the evaluation, then we meet up for a feedback session and some of what I have to say is just so painful or confusing (or sometimes wrong?) that we need to meet again to review it.  

It's even better if that followup session can be 2-3 weeks later, after the client has a chance to talk with friends, ""live with"" the feedback for a bit, and go to a certain subReddit for information.  Then they can come back to me with more specific informed questions and concerns.

"6933","Isn't that a weird feeling! Imagine, everyone else you've sat down to take tests with are like that for every test. I get impostor syndrome sometimes when my medication is working really well, but that little detail reminds me I'm just playing catch-up.

I'm so glad for you, it feels really good to defeat the anxieties and failures of ADHD, especially when it's tangible like a promotion and coming home to a clean house.","cr4tphq",1,1431291834,"2015-05-10 21:03:54"

"6938","As others said ADHD is neither a reason or excuse to not be interested in what your spouse likes. It helps to adopt a different perspective. Does she want you to understand the technical details of sustainable development? Or... does she want to share her own passion &amp; personal values with you? Likely the latter.

The main point of that conversation is not for you to enjoy-- it's to encourage and participate in your wife's joy. ADHD'ers may have problems with this, because this goal is not immediately rewarding/interesting. Maybe the particular conversation topic is one that you (1) don't care about (2) don't see the value in (3) don't see relevance.

Sometimes you have to grit your teeth and override your instincts. However, the pay-off is well worth it. She will be happier, and you might just be happier too (instead of bored/annoyed). 

For rent &amp; house stuff: ADHD'ers best friend is automation. Schedule those payments, and keep a calendar of important due dates. Don't try to rely on your memory/willpower to get mandatory things done. If you need to outsource repairs/services, do it. ","ct3p20t",5,1436926121,"2015-07-15 02:08:41"

I'm currently stuck hanging with my mother all week because she has a conference where I have a meeting with a company that offered me a job. I could have driven just myself, and not her, but that would've hurt her feelings and cost me more. I finally was able to get some time away and I seriously don't know how to not go insane.

"6946","My mom, who is usually so supportive, once said something similar to me. She said “you’re going to just have to get over it, buckle down and focus” while I was telling her how things had been going lately. I said back “Thank you. I’ve never had anyone give me that piece of helpful and useful advice before, what a novel idea. It’s not like I tell myself that every single day of my life.” 

She later came and apologised, realising that not a day goes by where I don’t hear that from someone or myself and it’s probably the least helpful thing ever. 

If that was all it took, I wouldn’t have ADHD. I think in those situations, letting some frustration out and telling them that you literally tell yourself that a million times a day and it just won’t work for you can be cathartic and help them see how you feel (if you have that type of relationship of somewhat openness).","ea91ykf",20,1542913809,"2018-11-22 19:10:09"
"6947","Depression is not actually the same thing as sadness. The description of emptiness was what did it for me: feeling absolutely nothing is classic depression. Especially, holding a kitten should do something to most people especially if they want the kitten. 

The ADHD feel of nothing being good is more like restless frustration, like nothing is interesting enough. But that wasn't what OP described. Depression has comorbidity with ADHD, and if you often feel hollow or 'nothing' then I'd suggest you might have mild depression too. It's not uncommon. ","e18gmxb",5,1529882522,"2018-06-24 23:22:02"

With a stimulant, you can stop taking it if there are side effects. I got that from Dr. Ned Hallowell, who is a psychiatrist and also has ADHD himself.

But when I said that to other people on this forum, I learned that there are other non-stimulant medications that you can't just do that with. So, like I said, I don't know what Vyvanse is.

I don't want to steer you wrong. But I think it's not good that you feel that way!

You can always call your doctor, even if your appointment isn't for two weeks. They'd rather hear from you than be surprised by a bad situation when you get there!","ga6rc2e",2,1603734319,"2020-10-26 17:45:19"

"6962","Oh sweety, I'm so sorry. You now a lot of us have been exactly in the spot that you have been. It can, and it will get better. 

Obviously your adhd isn't easy. However, I do have some good news, not all of this is your adhd. Some of it is personal habits, and behaviors, which you can mold into a better direction.

&gt; Getting and keeping a job is near impossible, despite trying countless time. I love working with computers, but all of those jobs require a degree and despite trying multiple times I can never finish a semester of college.

I never finished college, and I have been working on computers for a long time. My point is that I wouldn't give up this dream. The degree isn't mandatory, but it will definitely make it a hell of a lot easier. I really wish I had that degree, it would have opened a lot more doors in my career. 

&gt; My boyfriend is growing increasingly frustrated with everything I do. He loves me, but I'm worried that dealing with my problems will become too much. I haven't cleaned my apartment in a year. I get bursts of motivation sometimes, and get excited, and go to clean!... and nothing happens. 

So I'm kinda chuckling over here, and it's not directed at you. First of all, and I say this with only positive intentions... there is a big difference between wanting to clean your apartment, and actually doing it. I personally hate to clean, but I love the end result. 

Try this: Make yourself clean one thing every day. Put some sort of annoying reminder out for yourself. I use an app on my phone called habitica, and it rocks for this sort of thing. However, you can put something in the middle of your house that you only put away when you clean something. Then when you see it, you know you still haven't done it. As for what you clean, it doesn't matter. One day it might be something as easy as putting a jacket in the closet. Sometimes we're just tired, and it's important to not be too hard on yourself. 

&gt; I renewed my lease instead of moving because it would've been too difficult. My parents have to constantly help me with rent.

While this is bad, don't be too hard on yourself. You're still young, and you're going to do things like this. Everyone does this type of thing. They just don't talk about it. Be proud of yourself that you know what you did wasn't the best decision, and forgive yourself for being imperfect.

&gt; Stimulants cause really weird side effects that don't seem to happen to anyone else as far as I can tell. You know how when you're really tired your thinking is so foggy you can't even do simple math or remember anything? It feels like that without the tiredness. I can't even drive a car safely when taking stimulants. These effects slowly increased over the first two years of taking Vyvanse. After stopping it took over a year for the effects to disappear completely. After not taking anything for two years I tried methylphenidate and amphetamine sulfate (not amphetamine salts) recently and they caused the same effects, which lasted for several days after stopping. This leads me to believe that Vyvanse caused a permanent change in my brain, but doctors don't seem to care and their solution is to not take stimulants.

This is out of my pay grade. I would suggesting finding a new doctor since you don't trust the one you have now, and don't seem to be getting good treatment. Finding a good doctor makes the world a much better place. Please make this a priority for yourself. You can do some dishes in the kitchen while you're calling around to find a new doctor.

&gt; My psychiatrist keeps trying new antidepressants, but nothing really helps in any meaningful way.

Keep trying new things. The good news is that there are more options to try.

&gt; Worst of all, I don't know if I'm trying hard enough or if I'm just lazy.

We can all try harder. However, I know that I have pushed myself so hard that I became really sick. I think you know when you have pushed yourself too hard. Only you can make that judgement. Listen to criticism from others, but make you sure weigh their opinion appropriately.

&gt; I can't even play video games because I just end up pacing in-game and not completing any objectives.

As a gamer myself, this really gets my attention. A lot of people would blow off this comment, but this is what got my attention, and makes me think you aren't getting treated very well. 

Since non-gamers won't appreciate what you're saying, I'm going to recommend you keep notes on your phone about other things in life you're struggling with. then when you see your doctor next, you can read those notes to him/her. This will prevent you from forgetting what happened.

&gt; This is debilitating. I don't know what to do.

First of all, stay positive. There is a fantastic medical treatment available. You just need to find the right one. Keep notes, over communicate with your doctors, don't ever feel that you're a burden on your doctor because you're not feeling better. They WANT to help you. If you are getting push back from your doctor, then go find a new one. ","ddhje8i",1,1486564117,"2017-02-08 14:28:37"

"6967","Hi there, ADHD-PI here. So been where you are - and got through it successfully. In my long and illustrious college career, I wound up at a community college at one point and transferred out to an Ivy. Believe it or not, the cc had many more resources available for my ADHD! So, there is hope. :)

Couple of questions: Do you live on campus? (CCs near where I live don't have dorms) Does your college have summer sessions or winter intersession intensives? I know you said you have an IEP, but does your school have an office of disability services?  A bit of a rude question, but how much money can you throw at this? Are finances really tight or can you go out and buy yourself a whole bunch of supplies? Are there web courses available? Do you have a deadline (""I need to be DONE with college by such-and-such date"")? What is your IEP like? Are you finding you are having trouble actually getting to classes, or just with getting the work done?

"6977","My ex-husband had been in AA for 3 years when I met him. 5 years later I was diagnosed and eventually started on meds. I have not been addicted to anything ever, despite experimenting a fair amount in my 20s.

The first week I started taking my meds, he called me a ""pill-popper"". I already had (still have) issues with the idea of being dependent on a chemical to get through life, so this hit me pretty hard.

After that, I simply hid the fact that I took meds. My diagnosis was life-changing for me and he never even asked a question or did any research on ADHD or what it might be like to have it. The result was that he continued to be baffled at my typical symptoms, (he is ultra prompt and organized, super focused type A personality). This was the beginning of the end for us.

So I suggest full disclosure on everything from the begining. You should never have to feel like a criminal in your own home, like I did. Have your husband watch some youtube videos on ADHD, I think there are also some books designed for spouses too.

There is so much misinformation and criticism from the general public, you shouldn't have to deal with it at home too.","c69ckrl",1,1347879159,"2012-09-17 10:52:39"

"6981","So I have very invalidating family members who really don’t believe in mental illness or even some physical disorders at all. It’s extremely hurtful because I’ve struggled so much with mine and I know if I try to talk with them about it they will either mock me or tell me to ‘grow up’. 

My advice is that: 

I would tell them how they made me feel, and tell them that I wanted support. If they don’t care, then I would suggest not talking with them anymore about the topic (and maybe even in general) because if they don’t apologize and realize how their behavior is hurtful then they are fine with disrespecting and hurting you. 

Your struggle with ADHD can be shared but you decide who gets to hear it. You have a story to tell and anyone who doesn’t care to listen isn’t really worth the time, tbh, especially if you’ve been there to listen for them and their struggles. 

As for your second question: get professional help, it’s absolutely worth it. You can call up therapists offices in your area or get a referral from your doctor. You need to advocate for yourself and care about yourself enough to go out and get that help. You’re worth it, and you deserve the resources and support network to succeed in life. Remember that. 

I would recommend finding some online articles and maybe books to read up on ADHD as well, and some about confidence, boundaries and how to build those. Psychologytoday articles really help me, personally.","g6bmt13",1,1600872922,"2020-09-23 14:55:22"

"6988","I have been on medication for a year now.  I been on 5 different ADHD medications and various combinations of those medicines.  Here are some rough numbers

* About 2/3rds of people with ADHD do well on Methyphendiate such as Concerta, Ritalin, Focalin

* About 2/3rds of People with ADHD do well on Amphetamine such as Adderall, Vyvanse, and Dexedrine

* About 80% of ADHD people do well on one of those 2 stimulants

* About 90% of ADHD people do well on one of those 2 stimulants, or the 2 types of non stimulants we have specifically for ADHD.

**Non Stimulants specifically for ADHD**

* Strattera, an Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor that increases both norepinephrine everywhere in the brain, but dopamine in the frontal lobe but not the emotional brain such as the reward center.  Thus has no potential of addiction.

* Alpha 2 Agonists such as Intuniv (Guanfacine XR / ER) and Kapvay (Clonidine XR).  Alpha 2 is a type of norepinephrine receptor.

 * When you take an Alpha 2a agonist drug you increase the electrical activity of the frontal lobe

 * Alpha 2a, 2b, and 2c receptors when turned on also lower your norepinephrine levels generally.  Your body does this for it thinks your norepinephrine levels are getting too high.  Thus an alpha 2 drug treats anxiety, high blood pressure, the ""sweats"" and other side effects of too high norepinephrine which are turned on by Alpha 1 or beta receptors.  Too much Alpha 2 being turned on can be sedating.

 * Intuniv is an Alpha 2a drug so its is less sedating than Kapvay which is an Alpha 2a, 2b, and 2c drug.  Thus Intuniv is a better drug for ADHD but Kapvay is useful as a sleep aid or if your blood pressure is high, Kapvay will have a stronger effect on blood pressure even though both are also blood pressure drugs.


&amp;nbsp;

**We also have 3 other types of nonstimulant drugs for ADHD**

These drugs are approved for other types of conditions not specifically for ADHD but these drugs do treat ADHD.

* Wellbutrin, a NDRI antidepressant.  Ritalin treats ADHD by being a fast acting NDRI that works for a few hours.  Wellbutrin is a less strong version but it works for days.

* Modafinil, a wakeful promoting agent that is not technically a stimulant but kinda works similarly to a stimulant but also different.  Pretty much it ""wakes you up"" and makes you more ""alert"".  Used to treat Narcolepsy aka chronic sleepyness during the day.

* Tricyclic Antidepressants.  Work as a NRI just like Strattera, also has other receptors it turns on so it can have more side effects such as making you sleepy or cause weight gain.  Also used to treat anxiety.","cqum06s",2,1430447620,"2015-05-01 02:33:40"

"6993","People with ADHD often have rejection-sensitive dysphoria, which means being overly sensitive to what people think of you. It’s likely that those people’s reactions has nothing to do with you looking at them.

&gt; People who have RSD don’t handle rejection well. They get very upset if they think someone has shunned or criticized them, even if that’s not the case.

&gt; Up to 99% of teens and adults with ADHD are more sensitive than usual to rejection. And nearly 1 in 3 say it's the hardest part of living with ADHD.

Not sure what notes you're making but I realised a while back that ALL of my notes were actually things to do, to remember to ask, to search for, to buy etc..

Wunderlist has reminders, subtasks, folders etc. Recently wifey got on it and we have a shared list. With my recent ADHD diagnosis she now helps me prioritise by putting on our shared list the things I absolutely need to do. We agreed not more than 3.

Helps her not to have to nag me (the app does it for her), and me to feel accountable in a less stressful way. 

I am staying away from pen and paper as much as possible. I sometimes fall back into post its but I am getting better at turning them into a Wunderlist item. Took me months to get here. 

I have a routine where I associate Wunderlist with meals. Every time I sit down for a meal, I have to look at my Wunderlist first. 

I still miss things and don't do them. But a bit less than if I had no system in place.

"7011","Moodiness. Not like borderline or bipolar, but just outrage at the smallest things. Sometimes it can look like depression but is very short term. However can also cause or coexist with depression. Many people in anger management courses and in jail also have adhd.

Some have a few autistic symptoms because the impairment is in the same part of the brain. Issues with sensory stuff can make some doctors think mild autism at first. Something like 60% of adhd patients have symptoms of autism but I’m not sure how many have comorbid autism/adhd. Also, many autistic patients have adhd. 

My son has issues with loud noises like automatic toilets and hand dryers. Just the noise in the small space is like fingernails on a chalkboard for him. I don’t see him as autistic because he is very friendly and really doesn’t have any other issues besides sensory and meltdowns. He always needs touch and will lay all over me to fulfill that. He seems to be extremely sensitive to rejection too.simplest scolding will hurt his feelings. He’s 4 and undiagnosed but so similar to how I was.

I personally have issues with textures whether touching or in my mouth. Too much gooey? Creeps. Can’t handle noodles or thick cheese. Eggs? Nope mushy bananas either. Just gag. 

I also research topics I’m interested in intensely and hyperfocus on them for a time. I made beer and became a self proclaimed brewer and then threw or sold everything away because I got bored and screwed up a batch. I have been stuck on psychiatry and adhd/autism for a little over a year now too. Just can’t shake it and now I’m a self proclaimed expert again.

Empathic - some or most tend to feed off the mood of people. If my wife is irritable I take it personally or I join her in the mood. Not that I feel sorry for her (sometimes I do) but it’s more just feeding from it. 

With a decent iq we tend to be able to do anything and everything well, if we can keep our mind on it. Jack of all trades, master of none. I think this is from Dr. Hallowell saying that pretty much every adhd patient he’s had feels this way and they can be very successful. If they stay out of jail/drugs/poverty at least because of impulsivity. Like taming a wild bronco I think.

Ideas are plentiful. Write them down if you can or voice record. They aren’t all good but every once in awhile there are good ones. 

I’ll think of more, but I’m sitting in my car trying to go to work. The meds are sometimes too weak and sometimes too strong...

"7015","Yep.
  
Unsurprisingly it leads to learning nothing, not understanding anything, possible scrambling to learn all the material in far too little time, a lack of discipline(""will power"") which will almost certainly kick your arse for a long time later in life. 

Also all that stuff you ""learnt"" in record time? You don't *know* any of it. You parroted what you crammed into your brain, got the grade, and promptly purged everything from your short/medium term memory, before ever solidifying the concepts or storing anything but the tiniest details in long term memory. 
  
If you ever encounter a teacher that says something to the effect of ""Don't cheat, you'll only be playing yourself"", take note. Decent chance his/her material will be exceedingly relevant for your further studies, or the exam is one you can't really do well in by just cramming 48 hours before. Also decent chance that not doing the beginning work, will lead to no chance of understanding any of the followup work (like how math constantly frikkin builds on itself - if you didn't learn algebra, you'll start getting fucked in functions, didn't learn functions? You'll get fucked in the next stage, and so on).

If you can at all stall this development, or even better reverse it,  you will be significantly better off later on. If not then you will get to experience just how fun the struggle can be, on almost every single project later in life. :(
  
And yeah, ""that's later, not now"", but uhm.. Trust me, not a path to go singing and dancing along. Think back on the times you cursed yourself for not doing something when it would have been simple, and now you're staring at a mountain of things that piled up because past you didn't do them back then - that's not fun, is it?","g0b97rz",1,1596535868,"2020-08-04 10:11:08"

"7017","Thank you, your entire post has been self affirming for me.  I met my fiancee after being off meds for 2 years and then about a year and a half or two years into dating i got back on meds.  We had the same villain and raging problems.  He wanted the me he fell in love with back but he thought me taking meds/upping my dose was the solution.  Eventually i just quit my adhd meds cold turkey because i figured out what was making me crash.  This was risky because i had my boyfriend saying if i didn’t get back on my meds he might have to leave me.  He was at his wits end like i said and he wanted the me he fell in love with back.  So what i did was go through all my medical history and show him that i was off meds when we met!!!!!!

  (Also when i drink coffee in the morning i crash in the evening very similarly, it makes for an even worse night when i’m also taking meds.  For a long time i thought it was just the coffee causing these fits of villain mentality and not wanting to be touched by him. i tried to avoid coffee and still do and my boyfriend would and does get upset when i have it because he knows how emotional it makes me later and he worries about me.).  My doctors and my insurance company do not want to prescribe small extra adhd med doses for the evening, it just doesnt work for them.  But anyway i dont want to be on meds anymore.  I’m 4.5 months free of meds (withdrawal symptoms can last 6-9mnths i’ve read) and my relationship which was on the verge of collapse is now soon onto a new chapter (he bought the ring i/we picked out and I hope he officially proposes soon!). He is the most patient person and was at his wits end.  

Now i am starting to feel more stable from the withdrawal symptoms wearing off and i’m becoming a better listener to him.  Now when i feel attacked by him (which is rarer now and probably is caused by the occasional coffee crash) i give him the benefit of the doubt because i know he loves me, and i ask for clarity instead of assuming.
I admire your story and the strength of your relationship. I hope with all my heart that my boyfriend will one day say “I have my Abigail back!”.  I long for that day.","enewtpn",2,1557805882,"2019-05-14 03:51:22"

"7076","From an old lady here - just be selfish and make it about you. What do you want out of your life, and how do you make yourself happy and fulfilled. We spend so much time devoting our lives to others, I think, because our ADHD makes someone else's crisis more important than ourselves. It's tough work, prioritizing your own needs and being strong enough to rationalize it rather than react emotionally to any outcome.

See there's this weird thing that will happen when you start prioritizing yourself. People will be mad. Friends will think you've changed or you are brainwashed. But ultimately, you'll start to develop connections with people who really want whats good for you and aren't out to try to get you to do their bidding. I swear NTs prey on NDs in certain situations - and it kind of goes under the radar. Please be unabashedly selfish and make sure your happiness and contentedness is your number one concern. 

Right now, after many years of no diagnosis, I've built up a life that was essentialy the result of trauma and responses to trauma. I'm okay, but whooboy if I was 20 and medicated, it would have been so much different. At this point, I don't have a huge number of close friends, and even those are on thin ice lol - I am working on building up a life that makes me happy and where my talents are applauded... and where I don't have to fit in a constructed box. You don't have to do that either - but you have to set yourself up as the primary ""focus"".","gtk5wsc",1,1617710273,"2021-04-06 11:57:53"
"7077","Here's my (extremely verbose) perspective as an adult with ADHD:

&amp;#x200B;

* ADHD kids (and adults) can have a difficult time with friendships and social situations. So don't undervalue the importance of her desire to see her friends in class. I think that social and emotional learning are just as, if not more, important than academic learning, especially at this age and especially if she learns quickly (which she seems to). Even if there isn't much interaction in class, removing her from the sphere of her friends in school could still have negative social consequences. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Unless you plan for her to go online/homeschool forever, any issues she's having now will have to be addressed anyway, as I think all of the behaviors you mentioned would happen in a live class. I don't know that these things really have anything to do with the online element, as they are all things I personally experienced in live classes throughout my childhood. It likely that you just didn't know because you weren't there to see it. 

&amp;#x200B;

* That being said, lectures that aren't live can preferable from the academic learning standpoint. If I'm watching a recorded lecture, or even a recreational video, I often increase the video speed to 1.5x or even 2.0x depending on the difficulty of the topic and the cadence of the speaker. This way she'll be less likely to be ahead of the lecture. Also, being able to pause the lecture to think and being able to go back in the video if you realize your mind has wandered are also very helpful. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I don't think her problem is learning or being engaged in the material--if that were the case she wouldn't be reading ahead. Rather, the fact that she reads ahead indicates to me that she \*is\* interested and engaged, just at her own, faster pace. People with ADHD can be good multitaskers, so I would recommend trying to keep the lecture sound on, so part of her is tracking where the rest of the class is, while the main part is focused on going through the material at her own pace. Trying to ""slow her down"" in any way might make the whole thing so torturous she might not want to engage at all. When she finishes the material, she could start doing other quiet activities while ""half-listening"" to the lecture. Maybe she could draw/doodle. To non-ADHD people, it might seem counterintuitive, but doing things like doodling can \*increase\* your ability to pay attention, and can counteract boredom. 

&amp;#x200B;

* If you do continue with the current school and live lecture structure, maybe an accommodation could be that the teacher \*doesn't\* call on her unless she raises her hand.   Or, maybe that the teacher makes sure to specify the question again once she has her attention. And for future live classes, make sure her teachers don't scold/punish her for things like fidgeting or drawing in class.

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts: 

What you've described is \*exactly\* how I was in school whenever the pace was too slow for me, and I was always a straight A student. Elementary school, in particular, was excruciatingly boring for me, and I would often daydream in class once I understood the material unless there was some other point of interest. And frankly, I don't think that's a problem. As long as she's engaging with the material and learning it, what does it really matter whether she's keeping pace with the class or ""paying attention"" at all times? Because she has ADHD she will always think and do differently than her peers. But as long as she is adequately supported and not hampered by unnecessary requirements of ""normalcy"", many elements of her ADHD can be amazing \*strengths\*. Try to focus on learning and teaching her coping mechanisms for the difficult parts of ADHD (esp. emotional dysregulation and executive functioning issues) and helping find ways to be accommodated for or to ""get around"" rules/situations that don't suit her needs.","fm9b6k8",2,1585865211,"2020-04-02 22:06:51"

Also, since I believe 2008ish, we HAVE had neuro-imaging tests that can display ADHD but requiring one for every ADHD diagnosis would be expensive, time consuming, and unnecessary.

Most people with clinical (as in F's-up-your-life-daily ADHD) ADHD can be picked out from across a room by a trained medical professional. Yes, we could then spend $5k+ for a EEG or whatever, but why? 

If a kid shows up in a doc's office covered in blisters, from a classroom where half the kids have chicken pox but the kid in question has never had it, probably you can just treat that kid for chicken pox without lancing several blisters and culturing the resultant goop for two weeks.

Definitely worth checking out if your school has anything like that. It'd be a good idea to call before the semester begins and try to get an appointment in the first few weeks of the semester. Expect to have an intake appointment first, then another appointment about a week later. Bring whatever papers/evidence/etc of prior diagnosis with you.

My current mental workaround for this is ""I am terrible at this *and that's okay*."" Like I just own that I suck at it and my system is shitty and that's fine for now, and 'for now' is however long I feel like it needs to be. It's so much easier when I let go of the expectations and just assume I'll suck. Because dude, I just started, of course I'm gonna suck.

Hey! I just posted something about RSD the other day!  

I would definitely proceed with caution. My ‘RSD’ got me labeled with a slew of serious mental health diagnoses that you do not want on your record. You do not want: provisional ADHD. Rule-out BPD, BP II, cyclothymia etc... on your chart. That’s exactly how they write it (at least here in the US). I unfortunately have seen my previous medical charts... and it’s upsetting. They are not writing down the positive things about you, because insurance companies don’t care about what a great person you are and how well you manage your symptoms. They only care about your Diagnosis. This is a core issue in the field of psychiatry.  
**My suggestion would not be to specifically mention RSD**, but to instead suggest that you feel you have significant problems with mood regulation and it seems to be related to your inability to quickly switch your focus from one task to the next. You feel like you ruminate a lot (get stuck in an anxiety loop), are perfectionistic, and sometimes you feel an internal struggle between what you think you “should” do versus what your body “needs” to do.  
**The idea here is not to lie, but to frame the true symptoms, issues, thoughts and feelings you’re having in a less scary way.**  
  
 I did a lot of research... the **AGITATION** described in RSD is a hallmark symptom of Bipolar Disorder. **REJECTION SENSITIVITY** is a hallmark symptom of Borderline Personality Disorder.  

Yes, WE know it’s different. (I have had a few friends with borderline personality disorder, and yes, we had some things in common... but I can definitely tell you that we would not be in the same diagnostic category based on our behavioral responses! The first time I lived with a person who had bipolar disorder, I knew I didn’t have that either. It’s different...But to them (Docs), it all looks the same.  

So you know: **guanfacine** is Brand Name: Tenex, Estulic or Intuniv, and is used on its own or as complementary therapy to other stimulants.  
* It is available in the US &amp; Europe to treat ADHD.  
* Off label it is prescribed to treat Tourette’s, Tics, &amp; PTSD.  
* It may also be sought by people who are withdrawing from opioids or nicotine as it helps with hypertension and in reducing the stress of cravings....  

*In my opinion I think a person should always do a little research about the drugs they’re given.*

Anyhow,
What we are experiencing with RSD I think, is maybe a more severe, traumatized? (or hormone-charged version?) of this: @ 11:45 -

After all the testing, my results are that I have a high IQ, Anxiety, and ADHD. Unfortunately, I can't start medication yet because I'm still breastfeeding my baby, but I'm going to start working with a psychiatrist soon to control my anxiety, and I'll start working with my therapist to create goals and learn how to cope without medicine until I can get on it.

Memory formation generally works pretty ok, but not being able to recall things reliably on command leads to a wide variety of issues. Getting lost frequently, blanking out when people ask me questions about information I definitely know (“Hi, what’s your name?” “Ummmmmmm....”), forgetting what I’m doing in the middle of doing it, forgetting if I’ve taken my meds or not yet leading to both skipped doses and accidentally taking too much (I use a days of the week pill case now, which helps prevent overdoses), etc.

This is it. The solution to everything that could get lost. It has a place, and that's where you put it. Every time.

Things go in the same pocket. Go in the same wallet. Go in the same purse. Go on the same table. Go in the same drawer. On and on.

The routine of it makes it muscle memory, and if anything still gets lost, it's probably not your fault anymore. Something else must've happened. ","ctghprv",3,1437895849,"2015-07-26 07:30:49"

"7192","This is a tough situation, but maybe you'll be happy to know it's common among people who find comfort in relationships. So if I may, here's what I would do:

Your going to benefit from some time off, like you've suggested. This doesn't need to be a bad time though. Being single is the time in your life where you get to make yourself into the person your partners will fall in love with. Get your body into better shape by eating better and using the new free time to get exercise (sports, weights, whatever you like). Learn a new skill or language by putting daily effort into it, or master something you're only okay at. Get rid of your old belongings and use the money and space for something you've never done before.

So suddenly you're busier than you'd though you'd be and becoming a more interesting person. From there you have to focus on become a better person. The person you find someday will be inspiring, but then you need to be equally so, and to do that you should be kind. Not Ned Flanders, just kind in a way that's genuine and makes people feel like you care about their success and well being. This takes years so start today.

Finally, to do both you can take advantage of old and new friendships. Friends are made for this shit. That's why it's a good idea to keep them on lockdown while in a relationship, if you're ever knocked down they're the ones that lift you up. Let then make you better and be the support you need, then support them when they inevitably need you help.

Hope I said something that resonated with you, but I hope you know that you'll be fine as long as you challenge yourself to stay disciplined and not take easy paths in front of you. You can do this.","d5p9qx7",1,1469401668,"2016-07-24 23:07:48"

"7202","I've just now been diagnosed on the NHS - I may have been lucky. My GP didn't know a lot about the adult presentation but was happy to make a referral (although he warned me it would be a long wait). In the meantime I saw an educational psychologist through my university (this is available through most universities I think) - ed psychs don't diagnose (medically speaking), but she put me through a psychometric battery and a short interview and came to the conclusion that my difficulties were likely due to dyspraxia and 'ADD' (I know, not a medical term) - this was enough to get me some support at university. I forwarded a copy of the report to my GP as well. I saw a psychiatrist a couple of days ago (I think the wait was about 7 months) and the appointment ended with him diagnosing me with ADHD (probably mostly inattentive). No meds though - the adult ADHD service in my (pretty geographically big) area is this one guy, and to start meds I'd need dose titration under someone who knows what they're doing (ie this one guy). I'm considering my options and will probably get in touch with him to hopefully do that, but it'll be another, probably longer wait. Not his fault - his caseload is enormous. 

I still think it was worth it - just having the confirmation of the condition was psychologically a big help. The psych told me that the things I was already doing to manage it (putting external structure in place, using calendars/pretty rigid scheduling etc) were the right idea, and gave me some more ideas about places to find tips.

Meds would be nice, at least to give them a try and see if they lead to some improvement, but seeing as how they're not likely in the near future, I'm gonna keep fighting these issues the way I have been - hopefully I'm getting better at it.

In your case, there is the option of going private, and I think some GPs are happy to prescribe under shared care agreements (although this isn't guaranteed with any given GP). If you get to uni before treatment then consider ed psych input. There's also a lot of things you can put in place in your life even without medication that I've found very helpful - there's lots of tips here, or google them etc?","dlu5m0f",1,1503136711,"2017-08-19 09:58:31"

Make time to sit alone and cry. Eat out if you have to. Don’t beat yourself up about chores for the time being; practice self-compassion instead.

I could be totally wrong and speaking out of place here, so please forgive me if that’s the case, but managing your anxiety well might be a major key in living with adhd.

"7212","I'm doing well. Thank you for asking! So I'm almost three years in to my diagnosis, and I mostly spent the first year learning everything I could about ADHD, reevaluating all my past failures under the lens of someone who now knows she has ADHD, and practicing a whole lot of self-forgiveness. At the end of the day, I may have failed at a lot of things, but I at least tried the things. And there's a ton of good stuff in my life I didn't fail at. 

Year two and three have been about sleep, rituals/consistency in my day-to-day, and letting go of shit that isn't important or doesn't benefit me. This includes my own anxiety about dumb, little things that truly don't matter. Like, three years ago, I could spend hours on loop in my head wondering if I offended a friend by something I said or did, or didn't do, or didn't say. Now I shut off that voice before it even starts. I love my friends, I know this. If they're offended in any way, it's on them to let me know, not my head to make something up that isn't based in reality. 

I've found that once the daily consistencies are there, and the anxiety is shut off - Adderall has helped with both of these - I can get a lot done in a day. Or not, on the days I feel like taking it easy. I allow for that now too, guilt-free, because I know one day of downtime is just a day off, not a complete personal failure on my part.

"7218","I'm relieved to see that you aren't hearing any thunderclap-like sounds. That means I can -- with some certainty believe that you don't have anything in the line of a brain tumor.  That memory wall you're talking about -- I've been there and done that, and my only advice is to monitor your sleep. How has it been? Have you been dreaming lately?

Returning to the headaches though -- I can't say much for Pristiq, Depline, Clonidine and Buspirone, but I'm definitely struck as to why you're taking Abilify and Vyvanse. Technically speaking, Abilify would negate the effect of Vyvanse. I imagine you take Abilify to help you sleep? Anyhow, Abilify is sort of notorious for causing headaches. I had a very short stint with Abilify and it gave me the worst headaches of my life. Look at some Youtube reviews, and it seems to be very common. It can range from the back of your head, to the front -- sometimes it may seem like a sinus infection. Sometimes it'll even be at the very top of your head. It all depends on the person. So, if I could bet, I'd say the headache is a result of Abilify, which could potentially be worsened by Vyvanse. It's hard to tell because Abilify stays in your system for much longer than Vyvanse, so it'd be hard for me to tell you which is doing which. The tunnel of black dots -- perhaps it will comfort you in me saying when I took Abilify (directly after my initial Vyvanse experience with another psychiatrist) I was seeing green dots!

Anyhow, back to the memory, as I reckon it's alarming -- I know it was for me, but often time when you start stimulants, you can either do too much REM sleep, which can cause anxiety and depression which will worsen memory, or you will do too much deep sleep, which will worsen memory. Overtime, you should notice things getting better. I suggest taking magnesium supplements too. They've treated my functional memory fairly well.","eaj4q7f",1,1543269932,"2018-11-26 22:05:32"

"7239","Links to and mentions of ADDitude are not allowed on /r/adhd because we feel they have demonstrated themselves to be untrustworthy and that they, despite soliciting donations from people with ADHD to fund their operation, prioritize profit and advertising dollars over our best interests. Their website is full of articles promoting the use of homeopathy, reiki, and other unscientific quack practices. They also have had articles for Vayarin (a medical food that is now no longer sold in the US because its research was bunk) that suspiciously looked like stealth advertisements (which is highly unethical and illegal in the US).

We also find it problematic that their medical review panel includes not only legitimate doctors and psychologists, but also (at the time of writing) one practitioner of integrative medicine, which combines legit medical practice with pseudoscience and alternative medicine. They have previously had other quacks on the panel as well.

"7250","This is indeed a tricky feat, and I wish you all the support you need.
I would recommend doing some light research on executive functions and how ADHD cultivates.
If you could explain to them that, the reason why they CAN begin tasks when they want to, organise their lives &amp; maintain habits is due to their wonderful executive functions. I don’t know your family, but I would hope that if you can exhibit the fact you’ve performed your own research &amp; eliminated other possibilities, they will be more likely to listen to you.

Ultimately, you are their family and I am sure they love you unconditionally. With that love comes listening to you when you need to be heard, and when you require resources from an external source.
Often, parents just don’t want the hassle. You say, “I think I might have ADHD,” and their minds think of the financial ramifications, they think of themselves when they struggle and how they manage to sort it out themselves, and they want that same cognitive strength for you, so they assume it will come with time. But if you do have ADHD, this is definitely not the case &amp; it would serve you greatly to get a diagnosis earlier rather than later.

Approach it from a place of “I have been experiencing these difficulties consistently and I have made an effort to alleviate these difficulties in my own ways, but it is not working.” And correlate these difficulties to the potential of ADHD. Majority of people (in fact, pretty much nobody I’ve met) understands how ADHD affects a person, and how cryptic/intense it can be.
Their minds associate ADHD with children who can’t sit still. Rather than an adult or teenager with the capacity &amp; span of intelligence as everybody else, but no matter how hard they try, they cannot reach the level of competency they KNOW they have the ability to reach.

Again, I wish you well, and I hope you find answers soon.","gfvemeo",2,1607993887,"2020-12-15 00:58:07"

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

"7299","I nearly failed high school - math and behaviour issues. I pulled it together in grade 12 and did extra courses to get into university. I dropped out of one undergrad after failing one course and tried one semester of an experimental college for one semester but dropped out of that too and went back to my original program and pulled my shit together. At the time it was just how I stumbled but looking back now I'm seriously shocked that no one ever thought to suggest ADHD. 

If you do want to graduate the GED is hard but possible. Khan Academy helped me a lot with reviewing math concepts before I did my BEd. I did (what I know now to be hyperfocuse) go through the entire math curriculum from K-8 on there over the course of five months or so and the short video presentation and tiny worksheet bits helped me manage. I still make a lot of calculation errors and have shitty working memory but feel much better about learning math. If you do a GED that will help you!","fhsv7x0",1,1581865872,"2020-02-16 15:11:12"
"7300","I can relate. I definitely overspend on things I don’t need, and a lot of what I purchased I’d end up just donating because I don’t need it. I’ve always just thought it was ADHD impulsivity, but it may actually be a dopamine rush like you said. 

I can understand the getting addicted to anything easily as well (alcohol/vaping/shopping). What has worked really well for me is to accept what I can’t change immediately (my impulsivity and ADHD), and just divert my impulsivity to a job that pays well. I’m a management consultant and I truly love any form of deep-dive analysis and the adrenaline rush from answering 15-16 clients questions and concerns daily. It helps me fund my less healthy impulsive shopping habits and allow me to live “like a normal person.”

Not sure if that’s a reasonable hack, but I do feel an ADHD’s need for overthinking/over-analyzing places us in a great position for consulting jobs. And those jobs, in turn, give us the training/ schedule/ responsibility needed to discipline ourselves. It limits the amount of free time to do things that are harmful to our bodies.","gn8spac",5,1613235654,"2021-02-13 17:00:54"

An inaccurate name leads to inaccurate view from the general public and thus less/later diagnosis because everyone expects to see an hyperactive boy and when they see a spacing out one or a girl, they think ""it can't be ADHD since it's not hyperactive or totally unable to study!"" and so nobody send you to do some tests.

"7305","This story just made me cry my eyes. I’m the mother and my daughter is 14 and I finally snapped and woke up that something is wrong. After all the horrible fights that really escalated when she got into a much more rigorous private school last year. She always flew under the radar because her grades were always good her behavior impeccable in school. When she threw fits to do her summer reading and avoided it like the plague and she confessed she’s never ever been able to read a whole book, she said I just can’t focus, that’s when the bulb went off in my head. I got her tested and she was diagnosed with ADD with depression and ODD. I’ve read everything I can get my hands on about it and she starts meds tomorrow. I will always feel horrible guilt for letting her suffer so long with the depression frustration and deeply low self- esteem this causes. There has got to be someway to get through to your mother, of course she has a lot of years invested in not taking responsibility for helping her child!! She’s got to understand that your issue is not a choice it’s the way your brain is wired and it’s not wrong or bad it just doesn’t jive well with this society that treats children like one size fits all automatons . You all learn differently and process things differently. I’m so sorry you have had to suffer so much and your mom should be your number 1 ally. I wish that I could talk to her and set her straight.

"7325","Thank you for taking the time, it was never my intention to criticize anybody but I wanted to promote understanding. Just like somebody who has ADHD, somebody with something else can struggle in the same ways and to the same extent and it would be so great if more people could understand each other.

I think that because ADHD is not usually as psychotic as any of the personality disorders sometimes there isn't much of an understanding for that. Apart from here I have some friends in real life who have ADHD, that don't really understand BPD or any other huge abnormality in thoughts and behavior, in other words disorders. 

The tumblr pages provide pretty good anecdotal reports of how it feels, what one experiences. The only thing I will say is when you're younger and you find a forum where people have these issues, sometimes it's hard to find the right ones.

For all intensive purposes, some of the blogs might be better for insight whereas some might be better for constructing and promoting healthy behaviors. I've only come across a few that try to actually help those who are affected by it to be healthier and happier everyday. Sometimes finding a group of people like you in this case could be like being an ant and finding more ants and none of you know how to make a hill.

It's so unfortunate and it breaks my heart that there is a stigma behind treatment and a stigma in general so people think it is something it is not and don't get help for it often times.","d8jpzqx",3,1475964850,"2016-10-08 22:14:10"

"7331","Do you know where your local adult adhd specialist service is?

https://aadduk.org/help-support/specialists-support-and-coaches/ I'm not sure if this list is exhaustive.

Also familiarise yourself with the NICE guidelines:

https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg72/chapter/Recommendations#diagnosis-of-adhd

It sounds like your psychiatrist is not a specialist. In which case, having symptoms of ADHD is written down by a non-specialist is huge grounds for a referral to a specialist.

Remember that you have a choice in which doctors you see. If you can't get the psychiatrist from today to refer you to a specialist, then ask your GP to do the same. If your GP won't, then go to a different doctor. 

It's a terrible thing to have to navigate. Mental health services in general are difficult but ADHD gets too easily lumped into the other MH services when really it shouldn't be. The medications prescribed and the interventions recommended are hugely effective compared to those for most mental illnesses. There's just the need for the view of a specialist at the beginning. It's ridiculous that access to these meds are gatekeeped so much more than access to anti-depressants for example.

Get on the warpath and don't give up until you've got a referral, or been told it's impossible and believe it. In the mean time, you might want to try and save up for a trip to a private specialist. One or two sessions with them and they can prescribe via your GP so the fees wouldn't be ongoing.

It really pisses me off when I have to do it repeatedly with people who already know how I am, as if they have managed to forget in 10 minutes how my brain works. -\_-  


I also have a problem where if someone is talking to me, I can follow along perfectly and even participate in the conversation, and forget the majority of the content by the end of the conversation. This in particular causes huge issues at work where someone will start by telling me what needs to be done and then goes into the details afterwards. This same problem was a huge issue in school where the professor would present the point and then talk about the rationale but never restate the beginning point - by the end of each lecture I'd have no real context for the lecture until the next day when they'd give us slides summarizing the previous lecture. I tried taking notes but that just led to more distractions.  
Now I just make a point of restating the relevant info at work and asking them to confirm what I needed to do - I know I come across as an idiot but that's really the only way I've found that works.

"7348","My spouse has so many drugs from the doctors including straight up oxy and fentanyl... Yeah he really sick..won't be able to take much more, but so is the way of life right. And the psych know this since we have same psych. So I fully intended to bring this up that if there's concern of abuse in some form he needn't worry. Else I'd be sporting a caddy with spinning rims and bling bling in my mouth. I'll have to admit the psych and I have a seemingly solid relationship, and he has always appreciated my candor. But for your psych that could be the case. I think the fact I underwent hours of neuropsychological testing helped let him know abuse is not something he should have concern with me, else I would've went balls in on getting meds without testing. 

I do have a suggestion for you. I have a way with people of making them think my ideas are really their ideas. It's like an art, because it works on everyone. Mostly. Maybe, over a few visits, first touch on how the ER medicine is working less and less. Next visit, bring it up again, but make your appt later in day so psych can visibly see it wearing off and how it's impacting you (doctors love to see it firsthand, so maybe take it earlier than normal so it really is at the end). Plant seed that it's impacting your work, maybe cry a little, if you can (need incentive? Watch a few liveleak episodes) ;). By your third visit, unless your psych truly thinks you're selling the stuff, the boost would be added, because the psych will think it's their idea. I just wouldn't mention a boost again, only articulate how much worse you've gotten. Make sure doc again see it. My two cents since you said you feel you're getting worse. Or just get a new doctor. If you do, it might be wise to get copies of your medical files to see if your doctor has expressed an abuse concern, which I'd the doc has that'll follow you. And if the doc has, I'd address it head on before changing. Argue with logic and crush the doctors god complex. Secretly record it for posterity... And reference. Maybe even bring a relative with you to serve as a witness of sorts. Which will allow you to review the audio and both be 100% aware of what was said, able to checkmate a doctor's stupidity.

I've had to change ingrained habits in order to complete projects. Usually when I really want to finish one, I make it my freaking life and keep a notebook around at all times. If I have an idea, I write it down, but don't go any further than that. It's incredibly hard to stop myself from getting on my phone and researching this new idea. So I downloaded this app ""Forest"" it basically blocks you from doing anything on your phone for a specified amount of time, while the app grows a tree. If you leave the app, the tree dies D: ...it helps break the ""move onto a new idea"" cycle. Basically I had to 1) identify what situations I get new ideas from most (drinking morning coffee? Reading a book? For me it's working on other projects lol) and I then make sure the Forest app is growing a tree before I get into those situations.

For me the effects last about 10 hours and I can feel when they are wearing off. Knowing how long it lasts in my system allows me to plan my day accordingly. 

Also if I want my medication to kick in from when I arrive somewhere in the morning, I take them after breakfast to use my metabolism and breakfast as a delay. This allows me to not worry about looking odd popping pills in my mouth at work or school, or the dreaded, ""did I take them? I did...I think"" dance with my memory. 

I'm not entirely sure what else you may want to know. Also please know that this was just my experience and everyone's body reacts differently.","g5w6xbr",3,1600562319,"2020-09-20 00:38:39"

"7356","Ever since elementary/middle school I used to ruminate over numbers &amp; math problems. I think thinking about how numbers work was enjoyable to me, and it was a good outlet for my social anxiety at the time.

I wonder if there’s an element of familiarity with numbers themselves that makes this easier for some people &amp; harder for others? Like, if you think about them enough &amp; how they fit together, then mental math like this becomes much easier because you don’t have to mentally try as hard to think about the steps as much.

In my mind, these are the steps: 

Translating the written 63, 78 into the symbolic numerical meaning of “63” and “78” -&gt; knowing how addition of the symbolic meaning of “63” and “78” works (i.e. knowing what the tens place/a decimal number works &amp; how you can separate it into 60 + 3 + 70 + 8) -&gt; being able to simplify that statement into 141.

Honestly that wasn’t a good explanation but my point is that **there’s a lot of mental steps you have to jump through in order to add 63 and 78!** If it feels hard to you, then it’s perfectly justified. **You just have to realize it’s hard because there’s underlying concepts that you might not entirely be comfortable with.** If you identify those concepts &amp; master them, then this can potentially become easier for you.","gh9m7xt",1,1609136841,"2020-12-28 06:27:21"

"7366","Embrace timing and keep a journal/collage/index cards.  

""What?""

Well, It's the same day over and over, so at many points we can just relax from the anxiety over what to do, we can recede from that anxious question and slide into an embrace of the particular the moment of the day.  Many of us struggle with a primary moment of the day: consistent sleep.  A strong focus on making this moment of the day the very anchor of your day is the best bang for the buck you can get considering the good effects which result from it.  (*bang for buck refers to the limited ""directed focus"" capacity we have daily.)

For example, after focusing on sleep, you can build off it two ways, both a review session before bed and an enjoyable greet-the-day moment to start your day right by tapping into that good rhythm.

Because Embracing Timing is about both sliding/tapping into this rhythm and also about building and adding to the rhythm, being active: a ""seize the day""/""either I will find a way or make one"" mentality.  But what to do when everyday feels like the movie Memento? (Okay it's not as bad as Memento, but as OP notes it's like starting from scratch).  It's hard because there are so many options in mind for what to do right now, there are so many projects from before I had wanted to do, then the new ideas too, then there are sensory distractions at play, plus a compulsion for novelty heightened by a society enamored in instant gratification, not to mention (but I am) whatever emotional issues/trauma at play...

Well what helps directly is setting an environment.  KISS is a great principle to use here, mixed with your self-knowledge.  I like to work in bursts of time and I use a small checklist to set the stage: Fuel, music, posture, timer.  If you got a person/community you can use in some capacity, you should certainly do so.

What helps indirectly is the other piece of advice I mentioned, the journal/collage/index cards.  I mention the latter two options because a journal can seem flat at times, and I find images and mind maps are helpful to add. (I use blue painters tape with the index cards and put em up on a wall to make the mind map.  Index cards/mindmap are for big picture and making connections, the collage/visual are for inspiration and focus, and the journal is for knowledge (recording and reflecting) -- either way some of the power of all 3 is that you are getting out of your head.  Which is important because Balance, you can do things like this to invite Balance into your life.

""A man can do as he will, but not will as he will"", it's a quote from Schopenhauer that was very dear to Einstein, who used it as a source of self-forgiveness and patience with himself and others.  Do the same and get some regular sleep and that will be some firm footing for you.  Next step once you've got some stability: working on believing in yourself.

Yes I'd do it again, my reasoning is very simple: having kids is very hard but, how hard is not to have kids? I think people who don't have kids are not particularly happier in the long run. Specially girls. It's complicated to explain. Everything is hard, having them is hard, but also not having them. There is a price to pay either way. But if you do, it has to be something that you both really want to do, it has to be an unstoppable force that comes from within you telling you to do it, a primal instinct and irrational desire. If any of you don't have that then I strongly suggest you don't have kids together.

Yes, your mental stability will be put to test (more after pregnancy than during it), and so will your relationship, and your economy and your patience and a lot of other things too.

"7409","ADHD is tough, particularly when the subject matter requires abstract thinking.  

Here is my advice:  There is nothing more important than training your brain to be a responsible steward of your life.  

This mean you should establish routines:  Routines (think of them as reoccurring checklists) eventually form into habits that you not only don't have to think about, but you're more or less compelled to to keep doing.  For you, the creation of a study routine is essential. 

You should think in units:  You don't ""have"" to get 50 problems done tonight.  You need to get 10 sets of 5 done tonight.  Or maybe 5 sets of 10.  That kind of thing.  Don't read 100 pages, read 10 units of 10 pages if time allows.  

Be Permissive:  Trying to force yourself to into certain modes of thought will turn on your stress responses and make your ADHD worse.  Do not FORCE yourself to study, write, or do homework—ALLOW yourself to do it.  In practice this means changing your internal dialogue.  I might say to myself, ""It's OK if I don't really like this assignment, but it'll be worth doing, and I don't have to make it all perfect""

I think one of the big issues is me getting overwhelmed mid-talk with them, getting my defenses up and misunderstanding what they're saying. They get frustrated with me because of that, and then I get more anxious the longer the conversation goes, and it snowballs from there.
I will be real with you, kind stranger, this is a hard one for me to overcome. I feel almost delusional thinking in my own head, and it makes it difficult for me to decide whether I'm right, they're wrong, what's up and what's down.
I'm also realizing that I should be taking the idea of therapy more seriously, I need someone who can teach me how to ground myself, and occasionally ground me as well. 
(They have told me that if they didnt like me as a person, they wouldn't be hanging out with me, which helps until I've forgotten about that fact)

ADHD and anxiety tend to go hand-in-hand because if you have executive functioning deficits solving problems becomes way more difficult. We tend to be pretty poor at time management so what starts to happen is your life begins to feel like an endless stream of crises.

"7471","For one thing, any competent manager knows that telling someone they are messing up all the time will actually make them mess up even more. You become hyper vigilant trying to catch any possible mistake to the extent that you actually make more. 

The nurse sounds toxic - is she your direct supervisor? If not, I would suggest going to a supervisor and asking ""i know I may have made a few mistakes here and there - could you give me some tips on improving? How have you gotten so good at what you do? What tricks and tips could you give me?"" People love to give advice and talk about themselves, and you might get some helpful tips (not to mention letting them know that you are trying). 

The nurse is in the wrong for going to talk to your mom - you are an employee. While you are a minor, you are also an employee. It is very unprofessional (and strange!) to go outside the business to address someone's behaviour at work.

As for taking your meds - that's your own decision to make. Why are you not taking them? I didn't take them for awhile because i didn't like the side effects of the medicine I was taking. If it's an issue with the drug itself, talk to your doctor about trying other kinds of medicine. If you don't mind the side effects and want the benefits of the meds, then yes, you should take it.

As for your family saying you are stressing the whole house out, I was told this often by my family growing up. I was undiagnosed, and when they understood the diagnosis, they were a lot more understanding. You can't force them to understand, but stand up for yourself in a polite way. (example: when I visit my parents and I forget something, my mom well say ""you are so ADHD today! did you take your meds?!"" my response: I don't appreciate you blaming every little mistake I make on my illness. Everyone makes mistakes, no one is perfect, and whether I take my meds or not, mistakes will happen. I find comments like that insensitive, so I would greatly appreciate if you didn't in the future.""

While growing up around people who blame their stress on you is difficult, it's important to remember that you cannot make another person feel anything. They decide if your work performance will stress them out. There will always be people out there who will find reasons to be stressed out, and they will be stressed regardless of what you do. A simple way to make something not stress you out? Don't let it! I used to be stressed out because my house wasn't spotless - but I decided that a perfect house was not what mattered to me. Enjoying my life with my friends and family is what matters at the end of the day, and what will ultimately bring me joy. ","cp7ibtn",4,1425759379,"2015-03-07 20:16:19"

The thing about this statement is that it isn’t entirely wrong. It’s hard to avoid the fact that some people will identify with some ADHD symptoms. The problem is when the conversation stops there.

If he thinks he’s okay without the degree he might feel judged if you go after him too much about getting it. And I’m not saying you are or you will, but just something about ADHD seems to be for some a tendency to be really sensitive to any criticism or rejection, sometimes even if it’s just perceived and not intended. As a smart person with ADHD who didn’t achieve as they should have academically, like many I often heard about how much potential and what a shame I didn’t work harder, be more serious about it, etc. So it probably wouldn’t take much to be a variation on that as we’ve been hearing it all our lives.

That said, what I personally found with school is that I did much better when I took one course at a time. This makes it take forever but you get there in the end. He will be much more motivated if doing this is his idea. And if he has some courses under his belt already then maybe just looking at how many left, if he’s able to continue.
Aside from that, if he does so this just let him know time to time that it’s a great thing and let him talk about courses or homework or whatever makes him interested about it.

I've tried Adderall before, I found it helped more than Ritalin did, but made me somewhat hypomanic. I can't help but describe it as burning a candle from both ends, hard and fast. Comedowns gave me incredible depression too - not so pleasant! Different strokes for different folks I guess. Dexedrine would be closer to the Vyvanse you take, since Vyvanse is metabolized into dexamphetamine, and Dexedrine is 100% dexamphetamine. Dexedrine IR is probably right up your alley if Vyvanse helps (just not lasting long enough). Could take two IRs a day, spaced apart.

Along the lines of methylphenidate, you might be interested in Focalin, available in IR or XR. It's less likely to have peripheral side effects than other formulations, and the XR is said to last 10 hours. Just an idea!","cemg5xu",2,1389389926,"2014-01-10 21:38:46"

If that’s too tough, don’t feel like typing a journal is off limits! Either a laptop or phone keyboard is loads faster than writing, plus it doesn’t make your hand sore. 

For getting motivation, I have a literal gold star chart for doing things such as showering, brushing my teeth, and journaling!

Chugging water works short term, and intense exercise too, but only if I keep it up long enough, which I usually can't muster up the continuing motivation for.

Does this part sum up what you're concerned about or most of your concerns -

All of that can be tied to ADHD.  We can have trouble with mood, motivation, etc.

It doesn't actually make us introverts but it does get in the way of socializing and social connections so it can seem more like introversion than it really is.

"7541","The only way I managed to get good grades in highschool was to have multiple 1 hour private tutoring sessions for whichever subject I needed to work on. 

Also, notecards. Learn the art of making good notecards to quiz yourself. I would make a hundred or so for every test. Question on the front, answer on the back. Try to make a card for every potential test question you can think of. There are a lot online. 

Then you take your stack of cards, and you pick 3, you quiz yourself on those three untill you get all three right. Then you add one or two new cards to your 'good' pile (the pile that consists of the cards you're good at) and you practice the entire good pile, including the ones you know really well, untill you can answer the questions without looking at the back of the card. 

Then you add 2 more cards, and so on and so on until you can do the whole pile and get every single one right. guaranteed good grades right there. 

Doesn't work for math very well. Math is different, you have to learn by doing, not by knowing. You have to do problems to get good at math and get good grades. You can't just watch someone else do problems, or look at solution guides. You actually have to struggle through and do them yourself. A tudor helps. PatrickJMT on youtube is great for math and science stuff. 

What's your paper supposed to be on? If all else fails make a super obvious thesis and write a 9 paragraph essay with your supporting evidence and conclusion. Your grade is based on a specific criteria, having an introduction, having a thesis statement in the introduction, having supporting paragraphs that relate to the thesis in the introduction, having transition sentences between supporting paragraphs that make the paper flow nicely, having a conclusion that restates your thesis using different words, and bonus points for opening up new ideas for thought in the conclusion. 

By super obvious thesis, I mean retardedly obvious. So suppose your paper is on Baseball. I would go with the thesis, ""Baseball is a sport"" Then come up with the most obvious evidence that baseball is a sport. You'd have to figure out what it means to be a sport, but you can just use components to find obvious support for your thesis that baseball is a sport. 

Definition of sport: (I used wikipedia, but here's a perfect opportunity to use the dictionary as a source, deal with it teacher) Sport (British English) or sports (American English) includes **all forms of competitive physical activity or games** which,[1] **through casual or organised participation,** aim to **use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills** while providing **enjoyment to participants,** and **in some cases, entertainment for spectators.[2]**

Paragraph one supporting evidence that baseball is a sport:

baseball is a sport because it is both physical and competative. (Then you find a source to show people compete in baseball, all you would need is a book that goes over historic baseball games where someone won and someone lost) Then you can also say people move around in baseball, so therefore it is physical (source that indicates someone moved at some point during a baseball game)

I know it's stupid and a horrible essay, but if you do all these things, the worst grade you can possibly get is a C. Why? Because you completed the task. D's and F's are reserved for papers that fell short of completing the task, B's and A's are for papers that completed the task but went above and beyond in terms of the scope of the paper, and the quality of the writing. 

Just complete the task. You will get a C, and if they give you less you can nicely disagree for a C (because you did not fall short of completing the assignment, you followed the criteria outlined in the assignment, you did all that shit, please give me a C) and you will win the argument I promise. 

Edit: Also, if there is a page limit, don't worry if your paper falls a bit short. Most teachers don't want to read the papers anyway, they'd rather chill out and do something they want, they'll probably appreciate the short and to the point essay, and will admire the fact that you're obviously just completing the task and not wasting their time by writing some horribly long bad essay. I've never, in any grade, or even in college, been graded down because my paper was a page short.

"7555","For frame of reference, I've been taking 40mg of Vyvanse on an almost daily basis for the last year and a half.


First question, the tingling. I noticed it too at first. Give it a couple of days, it should go away as your body adjusts. Mine did. If not, I would recommend stopping and talking to your doctor about it.

Second question. In my experience, your body, as before, will adjust to the drug over a period of weeks to months. It may become less effective, but I've been on 40mg for quite a while and haven't needed to up my dosage for any reason. When your body adjusts after a little bit, it feels more natural. The effects are less obvious, and less physical sensations. Never taken antidepressants, but yes, it may take weeks to fully take effect as you adjust.

Third. This drug is not a replacement for sleep. Nothing is a replacement for sleep. However, it can be used to keep you sharp for a few hours if you have to get through some tough classes after a long night. Keep in mind that with this comes some downsides. When you crash, you crash fast and hard, and there's not much you can do to recover. If you take it too late, you're going to have a very difficult time going to sleep. 6 or 7 should be fine, though. I was talking about the 0 to 3 hour range. I can function without meds on 6 or 7 hours.

Fourth. Yes. Absolutely. Do not take this medication later in the day. I've done this a few times, and it was a very poor decision, and has been the cause of a few sleepless nights that could've been avoided. About the Remeron, I wouldn't rely on that to counteract the effects of Vyvanse. You don't want two drugs fighting each other inside your body. I'm no expert by any stretch of the word, but that just doesn't seem good. Mine usually lasts about 12 hours, so I would say plan for no sleep for the next 12-14 hours after taking it.


If anyone sees anything that looks wonky, please call me out on it. I'm speaking purely from experience here, and have no medical background whatsoever.","cvixcj9",2,1443584490,"2015-09-30 03:41:30"

For me medicine just trumps counselling.  My anxiety feels like it just has a neurodevelopmental basis and has to damped with medication.  I been like that ever since I had words floating around in my head.  I've made the mistake of dropping my depression/general anxiety/social anxiety/OCD medication several times and I become a functionless self tormenting slug, so locked in rumination I don't even want go out to get groceries or to take my hikes.  My thoughts will just block anything I want to do, and I don't feel I can do anything without it.    I even saw it with these two tenants my dad dumped me with when he died.  With my income I couldnt sustain the house but with theirs it was secure, and it was ever surprising to myself that I could tolerate them without being in too much distress even though on a fundamental personal level I didn't particularly care for them.  When I dropped the medicine my stress tolerability dropped to zero and I had to evict them, and now that left me in a sinking ship, and I been off the medicine since and have observed just how little i am able to do with out i.  Just realized I just have to tolerate some level of side effects unless I want to be tormented by my own mind to the point it paralyzes me until I die lol

I understand your situation and empathize deeply with your pain. As someone who also suffers from depression and ADHD, what I've found to be certain is that depression doesn’t allow you to see clearly or recognize opportunities, so you should focus on treating that first. 

In terms of therapy, please understand that not all therapy is created equally. I highly suggest looking into [dialectal behavioral therapy (DBT)](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/dialectical-behavior-therapy-skills-training-effective-intervention) and finding a therapist offering as close to an advent or comprehensive DBT program that you can get. DBT is an evidence-based treatment that was originally developed to treat borderline personality disorder but has since proven effective for all kinds of emotional dysfunction -- something not discussed nearly enough about ADHD! The skills training focuses on mindfulness, emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal relationships.

DBT singlehandedly addresses everything while providing immediate, long-term results by equipping you with necessary skills to communicate your needs to and be effective with your husband, as well as manage ADHD and depression. 

Also, if you aren't already familiar, research tranacranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-medicinal treatment for depression that really helped my brain reset and feel like myself again. More and more insurance companies are covering this, some at 100%! This will lift the fog, but you will have to change elements of your life that may be triggering depressive episodes which may mean getting a handle on your ADHD (getting the diagnosis, possibly medication, working with an ADHD coach to develop systems that work for you, etc.), re-examining your life (goals, needs, passions, etc.) and determining what serves you/the life you want to create and cutting out what doesn't.

Wellbutrin made me so grouchy. I kind of felt like I was in a fog, so-to-speak, and I would just get this boiling rage inside of me when I would get irritated. I didn't really lash out, but I worked in a call center at the time, and it made my fuse way too short and stressed me out. 

I'm on Adderall 20mg XR right now. I have almost no side-effects, and honestly could probably use a stronger dose. I wouldn't recommend Wellbutrin, just based on my personal experiences. But, obviously, everyone reacts differently. Strattera is more for ADHD, so that may be a good option. Doctors tend to have lots of Strattera samples lying around, too, so you may be able to try it without paying at first.

I just hate how the non-stimulants have to build up in your system.

But this does not in any way mean that people who are white boys are all of a sudden by default overdiagnosed. 

You wonder why I got annoyed, I got annoyed because you directly discredited that I have a mental condition without knowing anything about me, my life, what I've experienced, my symptoms or my background. Despite my agreement with you on underdiagnosis, I don't agree with or appreciate your method of arguing and your assumption that because one group is undiagnosed, the other group must be overdiagnosed. It's for sure a problem we need to fix, but you throwing around remarks that are completely false and are in themselves racist is not going to help us get towards a more equal society and more equal treatment of mental issues. I'd also say that this is a lot more about economic background than you highlighted.

And for you, you were in an uncomfortable situation and you got very uncomfortable/irritated and you just didn’t wanna be anywhere anymore.

Will a doctor prescribe you adderall? I don't know, but you shouldn't look for that, look for a doctor that will help you. If you're honest about your problems, it is *their job* to do the best they can to help you.

Honestly, I think the better comparison might be complaining about your birth defect (your arm is very short and you were born missing a finger and you don't have perfect motor control of that arm/hand) to someone who's arm just got seriously, painfully broken.

1. It's a great idea. Accountability to something is critical. For my professional life, that's to my co-workers, boss, clients. For personal life, I guess when something is on the calendar, where everyone (us, 3 kids, maybe cat) can see - it becomes real and binding.
2. Physically moving, at least to me, is key. Otherwise though I'm focusing, I'm also visually becoming aware of all the other things I need to do, just by looking around my office etc. So getting up to move to another room or anything resets that process.
3. I do think a lot of relationship issues (ADHD or otherwise) come from insufficient communication, and that's sometimes due to people speaking different languages. ([https://medium.com/pm101/learn-about-the-five-whys-technique-78283d75800f](https://medium.com/pm101/learn-about-the-five-whys-technique-78283d75800f)) is a decent start to 5 Why's
   1. Like, why haven't I put away my gloves and scarves yet? Because I haven't put away what's on the other shelves either.
   2. Why haven't I put things on the other shelves away? Because I don't know where they'll all go.
   3. Why don't those other items have a place to go? Well, they do, but I'm not happy with the current organization system for them.
   4. Why aren't you happy with the current system? Because they're identical packing cubes, and I can't find stuff in them.
   5. Why can't you find stuff in the packing cubes? Because they aren't labeled.
4. So then my wife will help me put the winter stuff away (which do have a proper place), and we'll quickly decide if any solution needs to be created, or in this case - we need 30 minutes to put removable sticky paper labels on the packing cubes, separate and store stuff by type, and now both the immediate short-term issue and the longer-term optimization are accomplished. I already know that 2 minutes of thinking the long-term solution is much more likely to get me to take that first step, than to try and push through on pure will-power alone.

This self-documentation is useful for me as well, helping me realize all the systems I have that work well for us.","gvqk6c2",1,1619290282,"2021-04-24 18:51:22"

"7692","Not that well, if I'm honest with you. But there are things which help me not to lose my mind :) I haven't suffered from depression since I got diagnosed and started putting these things in place. I built them up slowly and with the help of a therapist but there's no reason why you couldn't do it alone: You just need to dedicate time to doing the groundwork and prep for each stage, which we tend to keep putting off.

Lowered expectations help. I stick to smaller goals and don't attempt the kinds of things that my husband can do (finds challenging, but can manage). That kind of sucks, but hey, success is success. It's nice to set yourself up to win, especially because *winning* hits those dopamine receptors which we struggle to stimulate on our own.

I externalise procedures which are unreliable for me. This looks like:

- Waking up: 

 - I use a phone app where the alarm can only be disabled by using the camera to scan a barcode I keep in my bathroom. You can get many free apps which do this or make you scan NFC tags. Search QR Alarm in your preferred app store. Ideally, I then get straight into the shower but IRL I usually feel too alarmed by the concept of getting wet so I don't. It works if my husband bugs me to get in the shower. If I don't have a shower, I make coffee and drink it near an open window if it's not too cold. You have to PLAN and if necessary TIME how long it really takes you to wake up in the morning and get yourself awake enough to go to work, etc.

- Dealing with email and physical mail: 

 - I have a physical in-tray. Any mail or paperwork I need to deal with goes into this in-tray and I look through it in the morning and decide what needs to be done, what needs to be filed and what can be thrown out. I also check emails. Day to day I don't get that many so it's actually not such a huge nerve wracking thing. Then once I've done it, I have a clean conscience not to check email or physical mail for the WHOLE rest of the day, which is lovely. (This works for me because I rarely get urgent email. If something is urgent, people usually call or text me. But let's face it, there is not much that I'm good at responding to urgently anyway.)

- Cleaning up after myself/basic household tasks: 

 - I have a checklist of things which I need to CHECK EVERY DAY in the house. Not necessarily do, just look over. So it's things like, is the table clear, how full are the bins, is the dishwasher finished and needs emptying or are there plates which need to go into it, etc. In theory I do this mid morning but normally I end up doing it in the last hour before I leave for work or before my husband gets home. (Deadlines!) But this is another great set-yourself-up-to-win situation. I expect to have to do everything on the list, and most of the time, I can skip at least half of the tasks because they are already done, sometimes even up to 90%. So I feel like I cheated the system which is great. Don't add anything to this list which is going to take a large chunk of your time to deal with if it needs doing.

- Day to day organisation: 

 - I use Google Calendar because it syncs with my phone, google now, and computer directly in the OS (W10) though I mostly use it through my browser, and I can share tasks with my husband so it doesn't matter if I forget to tell him I am working late on a particular day. I resisted this for the longest time but now I LOVE it. Recurring tasks are easy to set up and change and I *add everything*. I check travel times and I input them because otherwise I know I'll just check it 10 more times and still almost miss my train or my husband will ask what time I'll be home and it's just there. I can switch things between our shared or my private calendar and I even block in things like ""Start getting ready now"" and tasks. This also links back to the email point because I can add things directly from my email to my calendar so I know when I'm planning to do it and can set a reminder if I feel like it might help. As a result I look at the calendar all the time to check things like bus times I've already input (rather than having to load the site which doesn't always work quickly or at all if my signal or credit is low) and it's a constant reminder of what's coming up next. It also occupies a panel of my phone's home screen which I'm always flicking past so it's there all the time.

- Nutrition: 

 - I keep in a stock of Joylent and if I've let it go too long without actually eating I make myself a shake for the vitamins and calories. I also have a mini program set up to randomise different meals we all like and I make a little meal plan which we then shop for every Saturday since it's the only day available for us. I use the calendar for the meal plan since everything in the program is arranged by how long it takes to prepare. Ideally I make the meal plan and shopping list early in the week, IRL I normally do it the last minute before we leave on Saturday.

- Personal hygeine: 

 - I keep an extra deodorant and hairbrush in my rucksack so I always have one with me. If I forgot to use one of them I can freshen up at work. I'm pretty good at keeping my teeth clean now so I don't bring gum or toothpaste any more.

- Longer (not basic) recurring tasks: 

 - I use an android app called Regularly which tells me how long it's been since I last blogged, exercised, changed the bed sheets, etc. That stops me from arguing with myself about ""I just did that!"" Nope, it was three weeks ago. Oops.

That's about it for now. I have had other things set up at various points but I've either forgotten about them or they have stopped working at some point. I haven't read it (ha!) but I heard of a book called ""Everything I've ever done that worked"" which I thought sounded like a useful idea, so I have also started a list of things which work for me. I keep it in a cloud service (I use Trello). I find that useful to look back on when I have one of those moments that I realise my entire routine has fallen apart and I need to start from scratch again. With that list, I *don't*. I can see immediately what was helpful and start doing one or two of the things again which then helps me to build other things into the mix.","ddzp2l2",14,1487623134,"2017-02-20 20:38:54"

"7694","Really depends on your area and the demographics as to if pharmacies stock it. Since it is a brand drug, most pharmacies will only stock what they use. We make absolutely nothing on brand name drugs, sometimes lose money. 
As to why they will not partial fill it, with class 2 drugs they must be filled within 72 hours of first being filled or the remaining amount is void. I am not too sure why they would charge you the price of 30 for 10. My only guess is if they partial fill something then you pay up front and the rest is no charge.","d33dq1p",2,1463096994,"2016-05-12 23:49:54"

In my case, I believe it is from my body being hungry, but I do not feel hungry since it is 4am. The 40s make me be hungry at night where the 50s push it to the middle of the morning.

If your mind tended to wander from topic to topic, I can understand that it's hard to find something to talk about if your medication takes that away. You can compensate by keeping a mental list of current events. Evaluate what they would be interested in by their social status, work, age, hobbies, and gender, and go from there.

For example if you meet a guy wearing a Star Wars T-shirt, recall some facts about the upcoming movie. If you meet someone that works in finance ask him if they are feeling the fluctuations in crude oil prices. If you get people going on something they care about, they'll talk for hours, and think you are excellent at small talk even if you barely say a word.","coyqxzy",2,1425022489,"2015-02-27 07:34:49"

While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

I moved to London from the UK countryside in 2014, having always felt some addiction to the buzz of the city. Now knowing I have ADHD, I realise it was the non-stop-stimulation. 

Personally, moving to a big city has had both negative and positive side-effects, but MAINLY positive! The only real negative is that on days you're struggling, it can feel like the millions of people buzzing around you have all got their sh*t together. However, this is totally negated by any conversation you have, where everyone else confides they have no idea what they're doing either. ;)

I also beat myself up on 'no-motivation' days where I feel guilty for laying about my house with so much going on outside; but this is a damn sight better than excusing my laziness because there's ""nothing to do"".

Jump in to London (or any city) and take advantage of the endless opportunities and constant motion; feed your ADHD! :) I can't ever see myself leaving this crazy place.

I would also want him to know that he wasn't alone, that it doesn't ostracize him or make him different in a bad way.

I have an Associate's and stepping into 8th year of undergrad to still get my Bachelor's but I'm almost there - i cant give up. 

It sounds like you have a beautiful family to cherish, Congrats on that, and I can tell you work hard for your family. You have a lot of experience under your belt that is just making you stronger and wiser for your future &amp; future career. I'm a Christian myself and I can tell you have great things in store for you ahead &amp; that God has great plans and purpose for your life. 

When it comes to God i'd say try connecting/speaking/relating to him for yourself - in exclusion of everyone around you &amp; if you allow yourself to fully believe while you ""test it out"" or ""taste&amp;see"" you may actually see how much God is working in your life and is ever present. 

Your diagnosis is already a step in the right direction as I'm sure the diagnosis is very enlightening, as it was for me too. I want to encourage you that things will get better, I'm cheering you on and excited for you cuz I can tell your timeline of experiences have been to set you up for something greater. 

And thanks for sharing your story because that alone is encouraging and inspiring for me and gives me hope to keep going. As long as we as we keep moving forward we can accomplish our goals.

- Use ""harder"" materials then the class. I find that online lectures from MIT and graduate level materials actually provide a lot more motivation for why something is being done, but you might have to browse around, and YMMV.

- Pass over the materials a few times. Once for overview (""here they use that formula thing from the last chapter""), once for details (""oh, thats how the formula works, and thats how it plugs in to that""), and once to do the problems and practice them.

- Alternatively: Do homework, and learn what is needed problem by problem. This works well for more complex problems.

\- ""Some [medical studies](http://www.steadyhealth.com/medical-answers/interconnections-between-adderall-and-menstrual-cycle) have shown that a woman’s menstrual cycle, primarily influenced by estrogen, can affect how bioavailable Adderall is to her body. During the follicular phase, which is the first 14 days of the menstrual cycle, Adderall has a greater impact on the body, including negative side effects. Women reported feeling high and also experiencing stronger cravings for, and physical dependency on, Adderall. The greater presence of estrogen during this time may enhance the effects of the amphetamines because estrogen can also trigger the release of dopamine in the brain.""

In fact, they [return to their pre-pregnancy levels](http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/depression-pregnancy.html) within 24 hours after giving birth. (Your body dials down estrogen even further while you’re breastfeeding because estrogen can interfere with milk production.)""

* Exercise. It really, seriously helps. 
* Get out of the house, maybe see some friends. Just interacting with people can often help you get out of the slump. I know I'm going downhill when I actively avoid being around people.
* Do a small constructive task, preferably one that clears your environment of clutter. Doing a small task helps you to shake off the apathy and makes you feel good about working on something constructive. Additionally, a clean work environment makes it *sooo* much easier to accomplish the tasks you really need to do later on.

I have that video #1 on my monthly review checklist because I keep forgetting those guidelines. 

&gt; as I have goals I want to accomplish 

Maybe [this post about sprints vs goals](https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-break-down-your-goals-into-sprints-689af9e97c52) can help. It has lists of questions &amp; guidelines for breaking goals into short doable sprints in a way that helps you stay motivated &amp; focused.  // *It's by the creator of the bullet journal method who himself has ADHD.*

Also, if your goals are about *learning something,* maybe it will help to take online courses about that stuff on MOOC platforms. E.g. places like Coursera *(don't worry, all courses there are free at least in Audit Mode, some of them are free even in Full Mode (that's when you can get your assignments graded); they will keep trying to push you to switch to a paid-certificate version though).* Their video lectures are divided into *small chunks,* have transcriptions in case it's hard to follow the video; there are short in-built tests to help you understand the material better.

Out of the courses of general interest there, the courses called [The Science of Well-Being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being) from Yale University and [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) are very popular.

Some notes though:

* Coursera has this trick for self-paced courses: they show you the start date as today. So don't rush to start lots of courses simply because they are starting ""right now"" :)
* Don't enroll in more than 2 courses at once. It would be too overwhelming.
* The weird thing about MOOC courses is that great universities can put out bad online courses.
* If Coursera isn't enough, Class Central site is a good aggregator of courses from the top MOOC platforms.","fsalgpn",1,1590833170,"2020-05-30 10:06:10"

The to do list tells me what to get done and may have dates that go with it. I check this periodically throughout the day. The contents of the to-do list are dictated by my planner which helps me see dates so I can actually plan a little bit and procrastinate a little less.

The more I can get out of my head and on to paper, the less anxious I am.

"7863","To be honest, I noticed an immediate effect on focus independent of motivation. To be fair, I was not taking Ritalin, but dexamphetamine (and at quite a low dose).

I can't say for sure, but it's worth taking a record of how your focus is during the day and bringing it back to your medical professional. Addressing the attention/focus issues in particular is important.

**The below may not all apply to you, but for others reading it may be helpful:**

Motivation is *nice*, of course, but it's not the primary goal of the medication, even if it's your personal goal. **Don't let the medication just help you become a more effective workaholic and overcommitter.** You want to be able to intentionally influence your focus and life, that's the real goal.

If the medication isn't alleviating the symptoms of ADHD for you, then perhaps it is not the right medication for you. Remember, it's not about making it so you can get all your work done - it's about making it so that you can *choose* to get all your work done.

Those of us with ADHD traits are often weak to the pressures of success and productivity - a lifetime of guilt and self-blame makes us sensitive. Don't let medication feed that cycle, use it to break it. Your productivity is not your worth. Your achievements are not your worth.

I'm glad it's helping with motivation - this obviously is helpful in the short term. Just don't forget to work smart as well as hard.","ek0kmor",2,1554291676,"2019-04-03 11:41:16"

Also hand making portions of the journal, and migrating tasks from week to week or month to month really makes it seem real. Apps get to abstract for me and I never remember to use them.

I still fight the impulse to make little comfort purchases, but Deep Town's gameplay actually helped me make and commit to a budget even though I don't make a lot of money currently, and I now can stick to it and plan for 'disposable' income so I don't feel guilty about treating myself.

I've had great luck with Adderall too, but for me I prefer Vyvanse because it's a little more... laid back. 

Methylphenidate is the drug in Concerta and Ritalin. 
It's different from Vyvanse, which is Lisdexafetamine. I don't think increasing your Concerta dose is a good idea. It's not an issue of you not being prescribed enough, it's just not your thing.

Definitely talk to your doctor, I doubt he/she will be surprised to hear Concerta isn't doing it for you. Maybe they can give Adderall a try.

Those meds raise your norepinephrine levels and trigger all the various dopamine and norepinephrine receptors (you have at least 5 different subtypes of dopamine receptors and 9 different types of norepinephrine receptors and if you raise the dopamine and norepinephrine you trigger all of them)  though the three type of different meds, amphetamine (adderall XR, IR, Dexedrine, Vyvanse) methylphenidate (ritalin, focalin), and strattera do these 14 different receptors in different parts of the brain and via different methods.

Intuniv by contrast for the most part only triggers 1 specific type of norepinephrine receptor primarily and minor effects on two other norepinephrine receptors.  Thus it is a great booster and it is still a decent ""primary by itself med"" but not as good as amphetamines, methylphenidate, and strattera.

While high doses of those 3 other types of meds may do the ""positives on ADHD symptoms"" they may also trigger unintnended receptor subtypes, while mixing those meds with a low dose combine with intuniv can help you reach the proper levels of the alpha 2a receptor while at the same time effecting medium levels of everything else.

Oh intuniv also helps with anxiety, and it helps with stimulant come down at the end of the day.

"7913","&gt;Highly functioning people have fought hard to be that way, non highly functioning have fought hard as wellbut things might have just not gone their way

And that is also one of those things that make it even harder to live with;

I both want and don't want to believe that I can do something about my paralyzed state, because there are high functioning ADHD people (side note; we need another name for this condition, because the name ADHD is fucking stupid and makes it even more abstract for people to relate to it) so why can't I do it myself? I believe I'm really lazy, and I am, I guess? But how do I know where the root of the problem is? Is it me, the real me just being lazy, or is it truly caused by the ADHD? It's so annoying and this in itself is debilitating.

If I got a dollar for every time someone told me a variation of ""you're just lazy"", ""so much potential, why are you not using it?"", ""I've seen you work hard and get incredible results, so how can I take this seriously?"" or anything other in that trend (I won't be dramatic and say I'd have a million bucks but) I would not have to pay a years tuition in university. This is not even counting all the times I made my mom cry for having trouble at school and hiding it from her. Jesus, that was handsdown the worst part of this highschool shit.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I need to hear more stories, I need to hear how debilitating ADHD can be, we need to show how much of a struggle it is to live with adhd, then maybe people will try to research it more. People will take it seriously.

Yes, that would be nice. I am of the opinion that we need to start some kind of campaign via this sub to just spam the entire internet with one well-written story about precisely this. Make people understand. Hell, not even understand, we just need to get rid of that running boy syndrome image. 

Seriously, the hyperactivity isn't even debilitating, I didn't even know I was hyperactive until three days ago when someone on here explained to me what ""appears to be driven by a motor"" means. What the fuck? Is that a criteria? In my first assessment appointment, the lady herself couldn't even explain what this meant. So, I was like, ""no I am not driven by a motor, so I'll cross the never box"". ""Ah, right. Well I've taken a look at the answers you gave, and you don't appear to have ADHD, but we will look into it further"". Seriously? I don't know what driven by a motor means, and that nullifies all my existance? Just take a look at the DSM-5, it's bullshit. ""I wish it was just running around syndrome and not the hell it is"" I read someone posting on this sub and that is exactly how I feel about it.

"7921","**So TL;DR** Shyness is personality trait not impairment. If your ""shyness"" is impairing your life, it is pathological and whatever you call it, it needs to be treated. Terms can be useful in two ways: they describe phenomenon so it can be recognized, or the label can be used to look for help for the recognized phenomenon. RSD and ESD are only half useful terms as they offer only tools to recognize it, but there is no actual help for it (aside one book that is recommended on every other site). Social anxiety and OCD are more helpful since there are more tools for them available. Issue is, they are more general terms and you have to recognize your own key points from a wide list of symptoms and find appropriate tools for them from a wide pool of tools.

**Original and longer version:** Shyness as personality trait shouldn't cause your life pathological harm. If it starts to impair your daily life moderately in multiple aspects of life, it is pathological. Whatever you call it at that point it needs to be addressed. Shyness, RSD, [insert some witty fake disorder here]... I personally prefer finding a label for things that are actually impairing, so I can find researched information or actual help for the thing impacting me.

That said, I was just today frustrated with RSD and ESD (emotional sensitivity disorder) as terms. My coping mechanisms with social anxiety have been lacking and I wanted to look to it from the aspect of RSD or ESD since they're linked to ADHD. Thing is, there is not really proper advice for these terms. They're defined and that's it. That is helpful in itself, but if it is not enough (as it usually is not for pathological scale problems) there is little more to go for.

At the moment I'd like to flip tables, since social anxiety treatment solely focuses on exposure. My issue (atm) is social ""hangover"" or distress that comes after the events despite the fact, I don't avoid them anymore. Exposure has not helped to that more than the initial quick alleviation and its still pretty bothersome. For RSD or ESD there is no proper suggestions to go for.

My best guess (partly coming to mind now) is to look at OCD treatment to control the mulling over that relates to this social hangover. At least there is something for it as it is a recognized pathology. Looking for the correct tool will be tedious though, as this is wider disorder and often obsessivity in it is not related to the human encounters.","dr4u44s",2,1513085474,"2017-12-12 13:31:14"

Red list: To do today or tomorrow
Yellow List: Within the week
Green List: Whenever

I also use Google calendar to create a very simplified block schedule to keep myself accountable. Example:

9 a.m-10:45 a.m: Transition time: So transition time for me is waking up, playing on my phone, staring at a wall. Basically preparing for a task while also chilling out

10:45 a.m.-1p.m: To-Do list: This is where I take my to-do's and complete them in order of importance. 

1a.m-1:45 p.m Lunch: I'll relax here and eat lunch. Maybe watch as few YouTube videos

1:45-2:45: Hobby: I'll do something enriching here, something I enjoy. For example, I play ukulele, write, or play around with JavaScripts for designing simple games. 

2:45-4: Transition time. Sometimes my hobby will leak into the transition time, but that's okay. I try to be very forgiving when time blocking.

4-6:15: To-Do List

6:15-7:45: Dinner. This is when I'll spend time with friends and family exclusively. Sometimes I'll cook, sometimes my partner will, usually my partner and I cook together and then watch YouTube.

7:45-10:30: Lounge Time: This is when I give myself permission to completely get myself absorbed in some sort of media. Right now I'm playing Bloodborne. Sometimes I'll be binging a show.

10:30-11:30: Transition Time. This is where I'll prepare for bed, shower, put a face mask on, cuddle with my cat and partner. This is to help my brain slow down before sleep. 

I find that block scheduling helps a lot when it isn't too strict and you add in a couple transition times.

"7933","When I was getting tested for ADHD, I was put at a computer and basically had to play a logic puzzle game for 30 minutes. I did started to blank out towards the end, but usually when I played games it was the only time I could force myself to concentrate. 

I had to wait a week for my results. I was so anxious. I knew that I did well on that ""test"" because I thought it was engaging.

Guess what? My result was that I MAY have ADHD. I thought that's it, I'm screwed. It doesn't even says that I'm likely to have ADHD. I don't know what else could it be that was wrong with me. However, I was still given meds.

The meds are the true test. I know a lot of non-ADHD people like to take Adderall in college, but compared to the effect it has on someone with ADHD, it does nothing to them. That's why you always start out with a low dose. 

For me, the result that first 5mg had was huge. After I took it in the morning, I didn't lose my keys five times, so I wasn't an hour late for work. I also didn't feel that I was still half asleep on my ride there. I was shocked that I was actually listening to the song that was playing, it has been a long time since I actually enjoyed music. At work, I actually did my paperwork. I was so far behind, I just couldn't do it anymore. But now I could. I also noticed that I wasn't falling asleep after lunch. When I got home, I actually had energy left to do things. Before I could barely get to my bed. Although it was tough to get out of my bed to actually take Adderal on the weekend, after I did, I didn't want to go back to bed. I cleaned, I cooked, I showered. Before I'd just stay in bed because the number of things that had to be done was too overwhelming.

I told my psychiatrist how many things have improved. I was almost crying when I told her that I don't lose my keys anymore. But I also said that I feel like there's still a lot of improvement that can be made. She agreed and gave me 10mg. On 10mg I basically had the same effects like 5mg, but it was 100% more effective.

Then I was given 15mg. At 15mg I did something that I thought wasn't possible for me anymore. I opened my old journal and I wrote. For the past 5 years, it was such a huge struggle to get my thoughts out of my head that I didn't bother to anymore. I was definitely crying when I told my psychiatrist that I could write again.

I think that there's still improvement to be made. I have something important to write for college, but because it's so important I'm too overwhelmed to get started. Since Adderall is a controlled substance, I can't have my dose increased with every visit. I've been on 15mg for two months. I hope that I'll be given 20mg next time. I know that my ideal dose is either 20mg or 25mg. I had 30mg for depression was and I was basically a crying robot. Never again. If I get the 20mg maybe I'll be able to do that thing for college.

If I will have to stay at 15mg for another month, I don't mind. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF MY HEAD. I thought my mind was gone. But nope, it's just ADHD.","ffgf4g3",1,1579904833,"2020-01-24 22:27:13"

None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

"7939","I feel very similar to you, and find my self feeling very stupid and compensating to make up for the fact that I do not remember. I was a TA for a undergraduate class, and feared constantly that the students would ask me questions about the readings, expecting that I would know, when even though I spent hours reading, I did not. Here are some ways I have gotten by. First, I am honest in saying that I do not remember at the moment, something like : I focus on remembering a few key facts or concepts so that if I am in a conversation, at least I know a few solid things. Maybe you always refer to a specific book or text etc, and use it very often with different people. Also, If i forget an author or quote, I simply say, ""the __ escapes me at the moment"" and everyone has that, so no one will thing twice about you forgetting. I also find that it is VERY helpful to talk about the text or concept for a few minutes before class. I worked with some students, and we would simply go over notes for 20 mins before class, and it reminded me of many parts of the text I had forgotten. 

I too am in academia and it is challenging to feel smart or like you are learning when you forget everything. I really recommend trying to work with a specific text in different ways, and see if different forms help to remember- for example reading one text and making a graph, talking, writing, highlighting, and see which method helps you remember most, or even helps you refer to it the fastest, ","cn82ne8",1,1419830962,"2014-12-29 05:29:22"

Boot up a drumming game, or play Beat Saber in VR and my whole brain feels ""reset"" after and much more clear.

My hope is, with medication, I'll be able to make more money and therefore get better insurance so I can relax... I think up until now I've been putting the cart before the horse by trying to have money first, before going to the Dr. That's just not been working.

I'm waffling whether to mention the alcohol piece to my Dr, because on the one hand I feel like it gives me more credibility, like I've already tried what I can, I don't want some BS advice about sleeping better or going to the gym because I've already been trying all that and I'm getting to the end of my rope. On the other, I'm afraid that if I volunteer up my addictive tendencies, I'll be dismissed or not believed or it'll make the process longer.

You might be biased, for a lot of reasons.

Not saying he doesn't have it, but for one example, someone with severe anxiety has the same simptons (lack of focus, irritability, etc).

If you daddy is the king of crazy... Well, yeah. But lack of attention and irritability are common traits in a series of stuff.

And by kind of crazy:

- he forgets everything, everytime. Like he loses his phone 6 times per day, everyday.
- he forgets important stuff, like house keys or car keys in strange places.
- he has left the house with unmatching socks (or shoes).
- he obcesses over what might sound irrelevant things.
- when he start to tiddy bthebbasement, he will do a deep cleaning and organize everything - but the process will take days cause he will pause to like... Read an old magazine and get lost on tought.
- he misses important appointments or meetings because he forgot about them.
- he deviates from the subject you talk about to say something related, and you end up talking about something completely unrelated (like start with Apple and end up on cars made during ww2).","fnnp6t6",1,1587097847,"2020-04-17 04:30:47"

"8020","I'm a fleet controller for a ad-hoc courier company. Basically I sit on a computer with incoming jobs on one side of the despatch program, a list of drivers next to that, a map of my city showing live positions of the drivers on my fleet and the position of the drivers on the other 2 fleets our company runs. We work through 2-way radios so I've got 30-40 drivers constantly in my ear over the radio as well as three other people in the same room as me talking to myself and each other. On top of that the phone rings non stop with people from the call centre needing to ask questions on behalf of customers.

On a quiet day it's frenetic and fast paced. On a busy day it's absolutely fuckin chaos and out of control. 

I love it. I thrive on this shit, on the constant flow and change of the work and the tight deadlines. The pressure feels good because at the end of the day we always get our shit done - that, and I'm pretty good at what I do. 

Having said that, prior to being diagnosed and medicated I struggled with: fine details on jobs, deadlines, forgetting to follow up on tasks and staying focused when it wasn't complety out of control. On top of that I had a crippling level of social anxiety (99.9th percentile nationwide) which hampered my performance as I would ""shutdown"" when having to confront or deal with belligerent drivers, customere or co-workers - my supervisor in particular has a very abrasive personality when he's under the pump which would kick my RSD into overdrive. On top of that the impulse and anger issues I've always dealt with made for some flashpoint moments which coule have been bad.

On the meds, and with daily exercise/good diet/cbt, none of that is an issue. I walk out of a high octane 10-hour day feeling invigorated.

"8031","1. Yes this is normal, especially for the first time. Adderall initiates the release of several neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, while also competing with said neurotransmitters for uptake. However, as the drug is degraded, the concentration of these neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine) in the synaptic cleft also goes down. As you know, the presence and release of these molecules are responsible for our biological ""reward"" system, and help us to feel happy and focused. Your body is merely responding to a drop off from a huge amount of stimulus. I've found that eating at the onset of the comedown, as well as small amounts throughout the duration of the good effects, helps to lessen the negative feelings that come along with it.
2. Increased dose is not always better, as it often comes along with a worse comedown. Also, drug desensitization often accompanies the use of amphetamines, meaning larger doses would be required to reach the original feelings that one had when taking the drug. Remember, it is your first time, and your body has not had time to physiologically adapt to the new input. As you continue to take the drug, your body tends to adapt as to lessen the negative effects you feel when it wears off.
3. No, 3 IR is not comparable to 1 XR, at least in my experience, as I am prescribed both. XR's last longer, the come-up is less intense, as well as the comedown, but I still feel a strong increase in focus. With IR's, the come-up is strong and intense, but the duration is shorter and the comedown is worse. Think of XR's as a walk up and down a hill, while IR's are a climb up and run down of a much steeper hill.
4. Interestingly enough, concerta and ritalin are the same molecule (Methylphenidate), concerta is more akin to a low dose XR, while ritalin is more like a higher dose IR","cvwn94t",1,1444626837,"2015-10-12 05:13:57"

Going through medical school seems to give them a bit of a superiority complex over other medical professionals, despite the fact that GPs often don't have a specialism and so usually aren't as knowledgeable about specific areas of health as nurses/doctors with specialisms in a certain field.

As a result they are usually quick to dismiss things outside of their remit, misdiagnose, and offer poor support. You want a GP who can understand their limits, and is happy to refer to someone with more knowledge.

I’m getting better but I’m not there yet. Anyways, my advice to you is what worked for me. That advice is to stop doing the things that entertain you throughout the day. For me it was video games and YouTube, which I spent every waking minute using. I sold my console and blocked all games on my computer and uninstalled all the installed ones. After a week of gettting used to no video games, I then stopped myself from watching YouTube entirely. I replaced it with reading books(which I hated) and reddit mainly. Then I switched from reddit to reading entirely. This opened up so many things for me. I used to never do anything besides the things that constantly gave me dopamine. Once I stopped, I had to get used to not getting any dopamine at ALL. It was terrible and the impulses were super strong, but I pushed through, barely. But once I got used to not being constantly given dopamine, it allowed me to be more willing to do the things I hated doing, and I also picked up other hobbies. But then my friend died and I was sent back to the YouTube stage. I’m currently at the reddit stage, gonna transition to reading pretty soon, but those 6 days I was reading for entertainment and not doing any of the other much more addictive things were amazing ones. I got SO much done man, and I know it was sustainable. But yeah if it’s your phone or something else, try to stop it. Treat as an addiction, like I did. Seek help from others around you.

"8058","Talk to both your eye doctor and also your doctor for the ADHD medications.

The brain regions that cause ADHD are also the brain regions that control both conscious and unconscious eye movements and tracking, as well as focusing.

ADHD but also other disorders such as autism have problems with these little micro movements called saccades.  Saccades are when you look at the same object but do micromovements so your eyes take in more information instead of staying 100% still and gaining nothing new.  ADHD people often make more errors with saccades where we track the primary object but we overshoot and do not remain focus on them taking in more new information about other things instead of taking more information on the primary object we are tracking, this extra movement seems to add to our distractive nature but it is not the only cause of it.  Some people hope to use saccadic eye tracking as an ADHD diagnostic tool

&amp;nbsp;

Brain areas in the frontal lobe (conscious eye movements determining what you should look at), the parietal lobe (sensory areas connected with figuring out that object is a chair, that is a person, and that is a dog), midbrain areas that do the unconscious eye movements, and the cerebellum and basal ganglia which are used to fine tune and combine all these brain areas like a captain on a pirate ship controls his crew and makes them work together with 1 voice.

I bring this up for these medical experts often can help narrow down the cause of problem or refer you to a specialist.  Sometimes there are eye tracking exercises you can do to help focus with greater sharpness, greater length till you get tired, and more smoother change of movements.  Sometimes there are meds they can prescribe if its not a problem of training the brain.","cue60qd",3,1440441614,"2015-08-24 18:40:14"
"8059","First of all: sorry for the huge wall of text. I'm currently unmedicated and thus having a hard time prioritizing the important points I want to convey and writing a concise message.

&gt;Does this also apply to emotions too?

Yes and no.

THE YES PART:

Yes because, well, emotions are just internal stimuli, and thus they are ""noise"" just like external stimuli is noise as well.

The ADHD brain:

a) Has a hard time filtering and prioritizing stimuli, and that's why it's so hard to avoid intense curiosity: your brain just ""can't realize"" that the butterfly is not as important as the conversation at hand, and that's why it prioritizes the butterfly as if it were just as important.

b) Constantly craves stimuli. Since we can't prioritise things, we are unable to do what neurotypical people do: get themselves to focus on boring tasks because of how important it is to them. The ADHD brain needs constant stimulation, and that's why we have a hard time focusing due to intense boredom. That activity is not stimulating enough, so our brain can't keep focused on it. That's also what causes hyperfocus: the ADHDer finds that activity SO FUCKING STINULATING so his brain is able to keep inhumanly focused on it.

THE NO PART:

As for the no part of my answer.

Besides what I've written above, there is also a particular point which does not fit into what I described above.

You know, fear and anxiety are very similar feelings with very similar functions: fear is responsible to make you avoid/fight a current, present, concrete threat, like the way you fear a growling pit bull running towards you.

Anxiety is just like fear, but it's about a future, abstract threat. I fear not getting into college, but this is a future, abstract threat, so I feel anxiety instead of fear. When I'm in front of the class for a presentation, I fear the abstract threat of being looked down if I fail to deliver a proper presentation, so I feel anxious about the presentation.

Anyway, let's focus on the function of fear and anxiety: they serve to get you to do something to avoid/fight that threat. That's why, when we're fearful or anxious, our heart beats faster, our body releases adrenaline, our reflexes get better, etc. This is our body yelling at us: I'M READY TO REACT! WHATEVER YOU NEED ME TO DO, I'LL DO MY BEST.

But there is one consequence of fear and anxiety I haven't talked about: focus.

When our cavemen ancestors smelled a snake in the forest foliage or saw a tiger running towards them in the savannah, they feared, and the fear made their minds more focused, giving them a better chance to spot the snake before it attacked or to hit the tiger's head with a rock thrown from the distance.

When our cavemen ancestors realized they were running low on food for the winter, they felt anxious about not having food to eat. This anxiety sharpened their minds and helped them remember about that herd of deer they spotted near the lake four months before.

Now, you know how the few achievements of ADHD people usually tend to be something they did at the last minute? That's my point.

We've learned through trial and error that we have a hard time getting shit done, but have also realized that, if we ever do something, we do it in the last minute. That happens because the high levels of adrenaline and cortisol (the stress hormone) help our minds focus if only a little bit. Of course we aren't aware about the adrenaline and cortisol thingies until we read about it, but we are able to feel it nonetheless.

We ADHD learn, not through scientific theory but rather through our own personal experiences, to *self-medicate* with adrenaline and cortisol.

That's why many of the functional ADHD people, especially among the unmedicated, are only functional because they have found a niche where they can get all their job done in the last minute.

That's also why many of the jobs usually suggested for ADHD people are those that bring a constant sense of urgency and frequent, intense stimulation, like paramedics, for example.","dz9b4p7",3,1526771175,"2018-05-19 23:06:15"

"8086","&gt;The propensity of amphetamines like Adderall and MDMA to cross membranes greatly affected by pH level. Acidic environments make it very, very difficult for these substances to enter the blood. Because the upper digestive tract can be extremely acidic this decreases the bioavailability of the drug when it is taken orally.

&gt;People who take Adderall therapeutically can render the drug almost entirely useless by eating a grapefruit before taking it, or washing it down with a glass of orange juice at breakfast. On the other hand taking an antacid can cause it to enter the blood stream far too fast, which can make it uncomfortably (perhaps dangerously?) strong for some.

"8098","Honestly, I feel like 3 is just too young to be certain.  Especially given everything he's been through so far.  And I'd have to say that, to me, what you've described seems to fall within the range of normal, early childhood behaviors, especially for boys (and that's a pretty wide range).  Remember, boys often mature more slowly than girls anyway, so even laying aside all the upheavals in his life, he's probably not going to follow the same developmental path that your older daughter did.  

I would say that you should certainly continue to monitor his behavior.  Keep notes of things that you think are symptomatic of ADHD.  And talk to his teachers.  Get their feedback, because that will also be important in a diagnosis (diagnostic criteria includes home &amp; school behaviors).  But I don't know if I'd recommend seeking a diagnosis just yet.  Frankly, I'd be a bit concerned with any doctor who was *willing* to diagnose a 3 year-old.  My advice would be to wait until he starts school in a year or two, when he's faced with a much more structured setting.  See what challenges (if any) he's facing in the classroom, and then have him evaluated on that basis.

Which isn't to say you should just ignore things now and do nothing.  There's no harm in reading up on parenting tips for kids with ADHD.  The key really is being very structured and consistent.  Get into a routine now, before he goes to school.  It's good for any kid, and if he does have ADHD, you'll be getting a jump on teaching him good self-management and coping skills, which are more important than any medication.

**TL;DR: I would hold off on a diagnosis until he starts school.  A thorough, responsible doctor will want input/observation from teachers for a diagnosis anyway.  In the mean time, learn what you can about parenting methods for ADHD, and start developing a consistent routine with him, so that he can learn self-management &amp; coping skills, which are essential whether he has ADHD or not.**

"8145","Here's the way medication typically works. A doctor prescribes a medication, usually at the lowest dose. It helps or it doesn't. If it helps, the doctor will continue to titrate (increase/decrease) the dose until they, working with the patient, find the optimal dosage. After a period of time, usually a few months, the patient develops a slight tolerance and the dose needs to be increased one more time. After that, it's reasonable to expect the dosage and efficacy to remain stable for years, even if it is taken daily.

I'm also quite lucky in that a lot of my past on/off interests (music producing, computer building, 3D compositing and animation) contribute to what I'm doing which is programming for graphics and audio. And my new interests, while seemingly irrelevant at first are actually very relevant. 

I think I'm a little different from other people here in that I tend to follow through with quite a few of my interests and doing so is a full time job and it helps that I stay within a single 'field' of stuff, so maybe its better not to view mastery of a bunch of things as some sort of personal narrative necessity. If you really get into something you'll find twenty branches of stuff to get obsessed about in it and if you can manage to stick to three of them, thats pretty good. Also, not learning to draw now doesn't mean you can't later -- building failure to stick to something in your head up is only gonna make it harder to get invested.

Since medication is a big change, it's important to add other big changes-- eating regularly/healthy, sleeping well, drinking lots of water, exercising-- in with it, or else the habits become super hard to break. I still take Vyvanse because it helps with my short-term memory disability as well, but given the choice I'd love to start again and do some things differently.","der4nrs",3,1489155749,"2017-03-10 14:22:29"

"8159","Invest in this book if you are a psychologist student (which you mention in your previous post) since I believe this book will be right up your ally.  The book I recommend in the link below is written by one of the leading experts on psychopharmacology Dr. Stephen Stahl.  Dr. Stephen Stahl has multiple book series, the Illustrated Series covers a concept such as ADHD, Bipolar Meds, Physical Violence, Chronic Pain, etc and is more basic than his Essential Psychopharmacology series which is like a bible on how medicines work with the brain.


Even though this book is written by a medical doctor and you are a psychology student it is important for you to understand some of the brain stuff such as this brain loop causes more inattention symptoms, this one deals with impulsivity, etc.  It explains how ADHD changes throughout childhood to  adulthood and it deals with the med stuff as well.  If your goal is to eventually practice psychology knowing the basics on the subject which the illustrated series covers will make you a better psychologist.

"8161","If you decide to try a Serotonin based med and you had sexual side effects in the past try one of these meds which are not traditional SSRIs but instead different classes of Serotonin meds due to your sexual side effect past.

Trintellix (vortioxetine) which is a Serotonin Modulator and Stimulator

Trazodone which is a Serotonin 2A agonist and SERT Reuptake Inhibitor (the technical name is called SARI).  Note there are other SARIs beside Trazodone in other countries besides the US such as Nefazodone and Etoperidone.

So both of these medicines are SSRIs but they do other things as well.  Certain serotonin receptors (there are 14 different types of serotonin receptors) cause sexual side effects, while other serotonin receptors actually increase arrousal, decrease stress, and make you a little more horny.

The SMS medicine triggers serotonin receptors that make you more horny besides being a SSRI, while the SARI medicine besides being a SSRI actually makes it much harder to turn on some of the specific serotonin receptors that cause sexual side effects.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Note recently the FDA approved a medicine that is not a SSRI in any form but a selective serotonin receptor blocker and selective serotonin receptor activator to treat female sexual disorders where they are just not interested in sex.

This medicine is called Addyi / Filbanserin 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flibanserin

When first developed in the early tested phase the goal was a medicine with antidepressant properties and/or anti anxiety properties for triggering those specific serotonin receptors and blocking other specific serotonin receptors has both anti anxiety and anti depressant properties.  Yet it was repurposed as a medicine for  hypoactive sexual desire disorder for while it does have antidepressant and anti anxiety properties the lack of extra actions things like SSRI and such means it is a weak medicine for those conditions (barely better than a placebo).

In theory Filbanserin should also help men with similar problems with hypoactive sexual desire disorder for those same receptors also do the same thing in men and it is not messing with anything unique to women such as specific hormones.  The problem is we can't say this for sure for most of the study on hypoactive sexual desire disorder is done in women.  Furthermore we know there are differences in men and women with things like orgasm in specific brain areas, and things like anxiety are far more influencing in women with causing low sexual desire and this makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint.  Men do not have to carry babbies and just have a successful sexual encounter, while Women have to carry a baby for 9 months and often care for the baby by themselves or with family networks (such as the male who got her pregnant but it can be aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends, etc) after the baby is born from an evolutionary standpoint prior to social organization that has occurred in the last 5,000 years or so.

&amp;nbsp;

Now wellbutrin is used off label for hypoactive sexual problems and other sexual disorders but it uses other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and modulating the acetylcholine system and does not mess with serotonin in any direct fashion.","df94gjq",2,1490169491,"2017-03-22 07:58:11"

The idea is to make it so absurd you overpower the anxiety and realize its okay to just do it. Don't make it negative, make it positive absurdity. Laud yourself on your ability to 'fail' or do something not perfect or be scared of something. You need to stop the perfection train in its tracks so you don't spend all your time researching and overanalyzing before even getting started.

I think of it like this: as a kid, everything was organized for you. You didn’t have to choose your schedule, your bedtime, your mealtimes, your routines. You didn’t have to worry about making dinner. You didn’t have a job. You didn’t have to arrange play dates or plan parties and get togethers and make them happen. Yes, there was school, but even that was all assigned for you. Childhood is more passive than adult life because children are not independent, and as a result children have more mental energy than adults to spare for things like voracious reading. Not to mention, in childhood your brain is a little sponge primed for soaking up information. Less so in adulthood. 

I’m not dumber than I was when I was a kid. It’s not that my brain stopped working. It’s that much more of it is now taken up by things like pet care, job, housework and cooking, planning and maintaining my routine, shopping, budgeting, returning calls and emails, etc.

"8215","Talk to both a psychiatrist (drug doctor) and a psychologist/therapist (talk doctor).  The psychologist should be doing three things 1) help point out dysfunctional thinking 2) offer alternatives aka cbt, mindfulness so whenever you get into a negative thinking cycle you divert the negative habit to a positive one.  3) setting up and monitoring some goals you do outside of ""class.""

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Now as for why the psychiatrist, aka doctor who does meds but not a GP.  Most GPs do not know enough about the psychiatric medicines and all the nuances between the various dozens of medication.  The doctor may get lucky or he may not and you will do better with a specialist who knows when to switch and when to increase the dosage, and what to do when you get this side effect.

&amp;nbsp;

But just because you have a disorder that can cause hyperfocus, does not mean just ADHD meds can treat it.  If your other neurotransmitters are messed up you can still have more hyperfocus/obsessions than you normally would.  For example if you have lots of energy (norepinephrine) but are bored you will seek out sensory experiences.  Yet lets assume your norepinephrine is normal and your dopamine is normal or high but your serotonin is low.  Then you will avoid stressors and anything that can cause you to worry for its the serotonin job to calm you down.  When stress occurs and you have low serotonin you can feel emotionally numb, with low want to socialize, and whatever negative thing happen will trigger a negative and *self critical* spiral.

-----

In other words what I am trying to say is **you may feel like a fraud** but that does not mean **you are a fraud**, when your body is out of balance such as messed up neurotransmitters, hormones, metabolism, etc it is **going to cause you to feel something is off** even if 80 or 90% of the stuff is okay, but that 10% can make you feel like shit.

Thus instead of thinking yourself permanently a thing, please get a second opinion from a medical doctor.  Do not try to self diagnose, do not even try to say I have symptom X thus my Y must be messed up, the brain is complicated and that is why we are going to see a **medical expert** to help you figure how to sort this all out.  I gave you **possible explanations** based off neurotransmitter and symptoms but I can do the exact same thing with autoimmune system issues, or endocrine issues such as thyroid issues, thus we are using a doctor to do medical things.

I second coffee, or whatever your caffeinated beverage of choice is. (I've read a lot lately about the beneficial effects of the compounds in green tea are on focus. I've been trying to drink more of that, but I've got to kick this caffeine monkey first.)

My biggest tip is to break your task down into the smallest possible micro tasks. If you've got a test to study for, just tell yourself that you will read and take notes on one page, then take a break. Or write one paragraph of that paper. Even one sentence, if that seems too big. Sometimes you will find once you get going you can do more than that little bite, but let yourself take the break at that point if you want it.","goazk2g",1,1613966856,"2021-02-22 04:07:36"
"8220","Therapist. I was seeing a guy as part of an integrative pain program. He kept noticing these patterns and finally figured it had to be bipolar or adhd. Mind you, I had seen him for over a year at that point, maybe two. And had seen another therapist for a year (he retired) and I saw another therapist for about 6 mo before that. So it took some time to connect the dots.

Also of note, I found some things that discussed adhd as an underlying cause of at least some cases of fibromyalgia, because the brain is distracted by every body sensation, including (very normal) pain. Now you’re struggling with just cfs, so I don’t know how that applies. I will say that pain is more manageable and easier to ignore (except headaches. Then I’m down for the count).

But I had the same feeling with fatigue before pain issues. I knew *something* wasn’t right and no one could find anything. And I too assumed it had to be physical.

As for the hypochondriac thing- I understand that too. I was constantly trying to find out what was wrong. But people with adhd tend to be really good at hyperfocusing so can spend hours trying to look for whatever the hell might be wrong with us. And being easily distracted, look up whenever a new “symptom” occurs. Plus adhd tends to be comorbid and/or cause anxiety, and health related anxiety is still anxiety.

Good luck to you. I can’t say if it is correct for you or not, but I believe strongly that it could very much be the case. I’d try to find some screening tests and see what they turn up. They won’t be definitive, but they could point you in a direction.

Also keep in mind that many doctors just don’t know adhd. So you may hear some dismissive comments. It’s worthwhile finding someone that knows about adult adhd. Because you can be successful with adhd until you’re not. It just means that you were able to compensate until then.

"8232","I'm in the process of being diagnosed (went to college counselor, they told me to go to a medical professional to get formally tested, as they believe I have ADHD, but they cannot diagnose), and the reason I decided to check it out is that the reasons I had told myself for my previous failures just didn't make sense. 

I'm 27 and am currently in grad school (for the second time...) changing careers from an engineer to a high school math and science teacher. I failed miserably the first time in grad school when I had to do more and more long term projects. The reason I (and school counselors) gave for that failure was that I was depressed and very anxious about not being the smartest in the room (graduated high school with 4.0, graduated undergrad magna cum laude).

Then I went to work in industry and once again blamed depression and anxiety about not being smart enough. I also realized that industry wasn't what I really wanted to do. The problem was, I wasn't really depressed anymore. I was living with my husband (no longer long distance), and I had a dog who was serving as an ESA. I actually felt pretty good and not depressed.

I then left industry to go back to school to become a teacher and I'm not depressed, and I'm certainly not anxious about being smart enough for the work. I *know* I'm smart enough and truly believe it. But I was still having massive procrastination issues and just not being able to focus. 

In addition, whenever I've had issues in the past, the strategies that worked were ones recommended to help with ADHD.

After learning more about ADHD in my teaching program and learning that it's possibly under diagnosed in women, I started doing more research and I felt like my life read like the textbook case for an intelligent woman with ADHD. So I decided to check it out.","dbrofxq",2,1483043851,"2016-12-29 20:37:31"

"8234","Exactly me! I've come to terms with going to work and just accepted that in my routine. I almost prefer work days because the obligations are it of my control and I NEED TO go. Lately, when making plans with friends or going on 1st dates or really any errand... I'm learned to make a ""maybe"" plan. This way I don't stress about it the entire night before and have to flake out of it because I'm overwhelmed. I just check in with them in the morning of, and either push it till later in the day if I'm behind or confirm because I'm feeling like I need the socialization. Something else that's helped with that is organizing my weeks tasks into 
1. Today (take out garbage, call the bank, wash your hair)
2. Tomorrow (go to work, call mom, laundry) 
And 3. Soon(upcoming tasks that are due in a  few days) 

This way I can feel accomplished and not shut off instantly with a huge list of tasks that I am expected to do! Sometimes I even start my daily list with something simple like ""eat breakfast"". This way I can cross something off right away and feel accomplished from the start:)

I figured it out slowly, why people wrote me off so quickly, which added low self esteem and underconfidence to my list of hurdles to jump in making connections with new people. Not that I've had trouble making friends, but i'm referring specifically to the deeper connections (the ones that go beyond sports, activities, common interests; where you talk, laugh, feel comfortable, and empathetic for a person you love--platonically) which are not common for me, even to this day. Communication is give and take, and I am a classic ADHD case in terms of listening. What's worse, is I felt a lot of ADHD shame and never made an effort to own my disorder or try to explain my apparent lack of interest. Zero acknowledgement.

In highschool I had no friends because I was super annoying and pissed everyone off because I could never sit still and couldn't stop talking and annoying people. 

In primary school I did well, but in highschool I dropped out of the harder OP classes (In Australia we have ""OP Classes"" which are required to get an ""OP Score"" to get into university/college - or you can choose to do basic classes instead which are far easier but you don't get an OP Score) - not because I was dumb, but because I couldn't focus and couldn't keep up with the work. 

In highschool I did some certificate classes e.g. Certificate 2 in IT, Certificate 3 in Multimedia. I remember enjoying the classes but I also remember spending 90% of the time mucking around and not being able to keep up with the work - the only reason I passed, was because a month before graduation all the teachers ""pushed"" and helped all the students who were failing to complete all the work (they basically just gave us all the answers) - I assume because the school would look good if they had more people pass. 

I remember in primary school when I was super slow at doing school work because I would always be staring out the window day dreaming or being distracted by something and never being able to sit still, always fidgeting and tapping things or building little structures on my desk with my pencils and rulers and stuff. 

When I ask my mother about all these things she blows them off, says its normal things kids do, and says that my problem was my computer and video games - she reckons that if I just had of focused harder in highschool instead of playing video games I would have been fine.

---

&gt;

&gt;The __rebound effect__, or __rebound phenomenon__, is the emergence or re-emergence of [symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom) that were either absent or controlled while taking a medication, but appear when that same medication is [discontinued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation), or reduced in dosage. In the case of re-emergence, the severity of the symptoms is often worse than pretreatment levels.

you dont have to change everything for everything to change in your life.

I like reading because its a meaningful and useful activity that i dont feel quilty about (even if i manage to read only two pages: thats still better to me than mindlessly scrolling all day). Especially if a book is easy to get through like the one i mentioned, it just feels wonderful to see yourself progress through it.

Also, YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE YOUR MEDICATION WITH ALCOHOL.  I should mention that your case shouldn't actually be a problem, because my understanding is that the extended release of Concerta only lasts for 8 hours.

Also, don't use an inhaler at the same time as Concerta, make sure to eat something (so you don't get nauseous - it can happen), and avoid citrus (it makes the medication less effective.)

"8314","The best way I can describe the meds is that it is like a walking stick. Some people need the stick to get from A to B but still have to put in the effort and walk to get there. 

I've recently started on meds myself. I tried other avenues before starting on meds (occupational therapy etc) but always felt like something was holding me back from getting what I should out of it. From my experience so far it has made such a positive impact on my life. My focus and memory recall is so much better, along with other things. 

I will stress though that it will not stop you from procrastinating, or help you focus on what you should be focusing on. While my level of focus has drastically improved, I'm finding it pretty difficult to steer that towards things I should be doing and not  spending hours on the Playstation. But I am aware of it and am working on changing my behaviour. 

You should also be prepared for the possible side effects of the meds. My 1st 3 weeks was a horrible experience as I unfortunately went through a long list of side effects. I seem to be left with circulation issues where I've been even wearing gloves inside. For me though the benefits of the meds far outweigh any negatives, so I've decided to stay on them. Of course not everyone deals with side effects but you're better off being prepared than not.","gv0kyz0",1,1618784023,"2021-04-18 22:13:43"

"8321","I wouldn't say I've got past trauma, but definitely anxiety made worse by things like caffeine. I was scared to try Adderall because of my anxiety. However, it did nothing to my anxiety. I didn't panic or feel anxious. It's my first dose today. I was told I should ease in with a partial dose, but I took a full dose.
   
Everyone is different, so there's a chance you might have problems with your anxiety with Adderall, but it's not the same as Ritalin or caffeine. Often, people find their anxiety and depression get better with Adderall. But if not, you can try Vyvanse or Stratera. Or you could take something specifically for anxiety along with Adderall. Don't think of Adderall as a typical stimulant. It works differently in our brains than in someone without ADHD and anxiety.

Most importantly, work closely with your doctor and make sure you have a plan for unexpected side effects. Keep in contact so you can find the med and dose that's right for you. I hope you find what you need!","e752sh0",1,1538639271,"2018-10-04 07:47:51"

Once I got diagnosed it all made sense. I would try anything to focus on getting tasks but my thoughts wouldn't stop so I would turn to drugs and alcohol. Once I started taking my medication my impulsivities and desire for my old coping mechanisms decreased significantly. I also learned from my doctor that substance abuse can be a result of ADHD. It's always good to be mindful of addictive tendencies but it could be partly due to your ADHD.

I've been put on Strattera twice, both time I noticed negative effects in under a week. Depressed mood, no appetite, just felt really out of it. Kinda manic. Mom thinks I should try it for a longer period of time cause it can take up to a month for the effects to start showing, but i'm not gonna go through that for a month. 

I could get the meds I need if my mother wouldn't tell every therapist/ psychiatrist/ doctor/ etc about my past drug use, which I get is important and should be talked about, but when it comes to helping be finally be a functional member of society, I don't really give a fuck about lying. 

I've failed every fucking grade since 5th grade and was never medicated. Junior year and I'm dropping out. Maybe if I got help sooner it wouldn't be too late for me, but it doesn't matter anymore, i'll have to get my GED and wait til I'm 18 to get meds for myself.

I have some trauma and obviously it made my ADHD symptoms worse too. But years of trauma therapy didn't do much for my hypersensitive emotions and my difficulties with life management. I used to blame my past for those problems, but that didn't get me anywhere. After my ADHD diagnosis I've accepted these misgivings as parts of me, and found some tools to help me work with them.

"8362","Addiction involves craving.  That's the simple biggest ""what am i dealing with"" difference.

Diving deeper, perseveration is when we repeat or extend a behavior in an oblivious, broken record way.  Going to the movies each week with an old friend who's really gossippy and always leaves you feeling shitty ISN'T perseveration, it's just a bad habit.  If you decide to stop, and still do it the week after without even realizing it because when it was time to buy tickets and send the email you just did it, that's being absent minded and on auto-pilot.  If you check fandango for films opening next week, and then click to see the week after, and then click to see the week after, and then click to see the week after, and 30 minutes later you're in 2018, THAT'S perseveration.

Addiction is a persistent, focused compulsion to behavior, regardless of the balance between cost and reward.  If you receive solve to quit going to the movies with your lousy friend, and find yourself suddenly coming up with excuses and rationalizations for going just one more week, just this once... That's addiction.

I think rockstar games does a great job of keeping people involved. I played GTAV like 20 times and I played rdr2 maybe twice because i like that one so much I don’t want to overplay it. Then there’s some games that I like playing that aren’t story based but I can play for a bit and kinda goes through phases. Skate 3 and bmx Pipe and both cheap free roam options but they won’t keep you engaged for that long. Also consider some more multiplayer stuff will have you playing for forever. At least when I had friends that’s what i used to do. You could probably use your adhd against your adhd as well. Unlink your credit card or paypal to whatever console or pc you are on so that way if you go to buy a game you will have to find your card and type in all the info every time and then you will feel so unmotivated to do so, that you won’t buy so many games and waste money.","giws5wl",2,1610389549,"2021-01-11 18:25:49"

I also had a chat about that with my doc and she was telling me that ADHD can cause depression (not a symptom but because of the symptom). Depression causes mood swings. So as you get a handle on ADHD, depression subsides and mood swings lessen.

"8380","My experience with vyvanse: It lets me think of one thing during a conversation, so it helps me find words and topics related to the convo, rather than bouncing around and forgetting/not thinking about relevant things. However, it does not help me with word recall inherently. The meds help with speaking slower and sticking with one train of thought, but my overall memory is still not that great, it's the one area I've not improved in much. I have less difficulty expressing myself because things flow, but I don't know that I use a more relevant vocabulary. I've just said the same thing in three different sentences, I must be tired

When it comes to known terminology though, I'm a little better- if it's something I use or see frequently I'll pick it up, but I have to use it often (once a week) or it's gone.

"8383","Hi, I'm going to hit you with some truth now. You are young but if you digest it fully you can use your current situation to benifit you in a way most will never have.

The big lie is that we need external encouragement from others. This is a well meaning lie but it does a lot of damage. The problem is, if we need and openly accept encouragement/compliments from others then we will also accept insults and negativity as well.

 It is a never ending trap of seeking approval and avoiding criticism. 

Do yourself a huge favor and disregard both from here on out. When someone compliments you, smile, say thanks,  be gracious but do not agree internally. When someone puts you down just shrug it off. It can help to visualize an invisable suit of armor that the insults and compliments bounce off. You stay peacful while that goes on outside. 

You are the only ones opinion that matters. Do what you want. Build yourself in the manor you wish to be. If others don't accept it then it has nothing to do with you. If you can use your situation to learn this you'll live a free life. Peoples insults will be easily shrugged off as well as their compliments. You'll gradually stop feeling the need to strike back too. You'll realize they never learned what you have. You may have empathy for them.

If you get put on a pedestal by others it means nothing. If you get put down by others it means nothing.  This is the path to being actually free.

This does not require being rude, cold hearted, brash etc. In fact if you can do this you'll have an inner peace and freedom that will serve you forever and a reservoir of energy most people spend on this stuff. 

Your parent's are doing their best despite what it looks like. They are trying to steer you using what tools were used on them by their parents, misguided though they may be. Forgive them inside if you are able.

"8396","Sorry to ask, but what does GP mean? Is that your doctor? 

I (27M) live in the Netherlands and I told my doctor about the mental issues I was having, he got me in touch with a lady who was doing Social Works at the same doctors' office. I explained my feelings and thoughts to this lady, and ultimately she got me a referral letter so I could go the psychologist. The psychologist tested me for ADHD+ADD and the result was finally that I indeed had ADD. I was so glad to find out about this after more then 15 years of suspecting it.  
I have been to the social worker before a couple of years ago with the same issues, but they couldn't really help me at that moment. I think this was mostly my own fault because I didn't explain the mental issues I had well enough, not sure what you told to your doctor but you really have to be honest and make clear that the issues you are having are severe, otherwise you probably won't get a referral to a psychologist or therapist I think.

Write thoughts and feelings and then you can go back and see how they change. If you start noticing things like anger outbursts or having a hard time controlling emotions or hearing voices, stop the medicine and go see your doctor. You are already at risk and taking the medicine does put you more at risk but from what I understand it's something that could be a problem while taking the medicine but If you stop the medicine the symptoms should stop.

"8439","I had the same problem as you. My mom is super anal about a lot of stuff, typical strict Asian mom. She would punish me for the smallest thing. Till today, I can't cook using a wooden spatula because I physically cannot bring myself to touch it. It reminds me of all the beatings I had as a kid when my teachers complained to her about me not submitting assignments on time. 

So I would always lie about homework, and about a lot of stuff really. Executive dysfunction sucks, and anything she asked me to do, I wouldn't be able to do it for a long time, so I would just lie and say I had done it. It got to the point where I could lie without batting an eyelid and she would actually believe me. 

One thing that helped was not lying to my friends. I used to compulsively lie to my friends too, until one day I realised that most of the things I lied about weren't even necessary. Like, why was I wasting effort trying to maintain a lie that didn't need to be told in the first place? I could just tell them the truth, and if they didn't accept me because of who I am, hell, I need better friends then.

I started with making it a personal policy never to lie to my friends (except white lies I guess). Soon, it helped me regain that sense of guilt whenever I lie to someone. I worked with that guilt and took it over into not lying to my mom. She still gets mad at small stuff but I realised that this is her problem to deal with and I am not responsible for her anger management issues. It was very liberating.

"8451","I wish I had more useful advice, but I found this interesting:

&gt;I'm not depressed, I just don't care about school at all. But I logically recognize how important a degree is to my quality of life and how much harder it will be without one. I also recognize the continuing disappointment I cause my parents.

I've been in the same position, especially while in school. I can't even count how many times I *knew* that life would be easier if I had the motivation to start things early, only to wait until it was almost time to get to bed to get working (which is miserable). There would even be times where I'd be proactive once, recognize how great it felt...and then revert to old habits at the next opportunity.

I can't say this is your problem, but my problem was that the ""logic"" wasn't important to me. Logically, I should get out of bed soon after I wake up, so I'm not running late to work, but I don't. Because my work is flexible, I can come late, so I do (even though I shouldn't). 

I guess for me - and it's something I still struggle with - was finding a level of accountability, usually through consequences. For you, you say that you understand the logic behind having a college degree. However, it doesn't necessarily seem that important (I could be wrong) - because the benefit of having one isn't enough to make you care. When I felt unmotivated, sometimes it was better not to look at the goal, but rather the consequences of failure. Sometimes, avoiding consequences was more important than reaching a goal. But for that, you have to find a set of consequences that you find compelling. If skipping class and missing deadlines leads to an outcome that doesn't bother you (failing courses), you might have to find something that does.","d09lk7x",1,1456168615,"2016-02-22 19:16:55"

People know you have a phone and believe that gives them title to call you whenever, and expect you to answer or call back. Get angry if you don't. 

Checking the voicemail isn't a big deal for me, just talking to people is. Anticipating the *content* of the voicemail may make me anxious, though. ","d0woiq7",1,1457745674,"2016-03-12 01:21:14"

Benefits: (widely variable from day to day and situation of course)

 Being able to better self observe what is self sabotaging and what is helpful behavior. 

Being able to get out of a rut, or at least have a fighting chance of doing so.

Being able to interact with others better -so as not to reinforce  the tendency to isolate when those interactions end up badly.

Less impulsiveness

As for therapy, I feel as if that's more helpful for the comorbid conditions like depression and anxiety, haven't felt that it ever addressed the ADHD symptoms. Could be due to practitioners neing untrained/under trained  and more familiar and confident in dealing with those other conditions.

The most terrifying is when I forget something so utterly that it never comes back within moments of it happening. Example: I went to put fuel in the car. I arrived, got out, put the nozzle in the fuel tank hole and pulled the handle. Click. Pulled the handle. Click. Click. What?

I went inside and got the attendant who pointed out that the reason it was clicking off is because the tank was full. Bit that made no sense, it had the warning light on when I went in!? Or did it?

Yep. It did. It turns out I'd fully refilled the tank, put the nozzle back on the holder, immediately forgot I'd done it, picked the nozzle back up which had auto cleared the previous fill, and attempted to fill the car again. They wondered what the hell I was doing.

"8509","About the book reading specifically:

This comment also will probably only apply if you take public transportation often.

I had always wanted to be good about reading regularly. I have a v severe ADHD. Something I've learned about having it is that we will struggle a lot with transitioning from one activity to the other, even if the next activity seems awesome! So a lot of what I do to deal with ADHD is focusing on MAKING myself just rip the band-aid and make that transition.

So, I've always wanted to read Dune, and I've had a copy in my bag for ages the same way everyone here has been reporting. So, I had to invent a system for myself: every time I sit on the train to commute, I check my phone for notifications and THEN I tell my brain: ""No matter how unattracted I am to the idea of reading right now, just shut up and start."" And then 2 minutes later I'm loving the book and sad when my commute ends because I wanna keep reading!

TL:DR

My advice as someone with intense ADHD: the key is just STARTING. Just START the thing you should or want to do. Just convince yourself to give the thing 5 MINUTES and then bam you'll be like holy shit I'm actually engaged in this next activity now haha","ei26jpv",1,1552038882,"2019-03-08 09:54:42"

"8518","""Hyperfocus"" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD.

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

"8541","Sorry but no, its not quite that simple. Its too generic to say if someone without ADHD takes Vyvanse they become more energetic. 

First thing that people need to get to grips with about medication, they affect people very very differently. Its why there's no one size fits all even among meds. 

To give you an example from my own life, I'm ADHD-C, but without medication, I can't take a step out of bed, much less, do any meaningful work for extended periods of time (extended being 15mins and above lol). The meds made me energetic, and that made me get out and do shit because I had the energy to do it now, along with the motivation, working memory, and all my skills being usable once again. 

Just because you feel more energetic if you take too much, doesn't mean that's how others feel too. In fact, if I take a double dose instead of the regular one, I feel calmer and more in control of my body instead of energetic but unable to control it on a 30mg dose.","ehcpy9k",1,1551220246,"2019-02-26 22:30:46"

"8558","First and foremost, you can ask in the nicest way possible and he needs to understand that his defensiveness is something *he* needs to work on, too. The responsibility cannot be solely on you. 

That being said, my husband usually appeals to my desire to be a good partner. Sometimes flattery like, ""can you be the best wife ever and do ____"". Or if I don't want to do it right now, we make a compromise on when it will be done by. Again, I want to be a good partner so I'm more motivated to keep up my side of that agreement. 

Don't ask when he's in the middle of something. If he's playing games or working, people with ADHD have a hard time switching to a new task. The best time to ask is when he's about to switch tasks anyway (e.g. ask to do dishes after dinner before he goes back to leisure time).

These will have varying degrees of success depending on his mood, your mood, whether Mercury is retrograde with Venus (/s). I can tell you what absolutely will *never* work. If my husband talks to me with anger or annoyance or disappointment. My mom talked to me like that and my shame makes me defensive. I totally understand his anger and I know my actions are frustrating. I need to learn to control my defensiveness.

"8563","No and I find it weird. There are two problems with that. One is that entrepreneurs can never be sure if they can pay the bills, and the second is that it heavily depends on networking and making business contacts. 

Now for networking and making contacts, since I tend to interrupt, foolishly insult etc. people, and they on the other hand bore me, I am not exactly a social butterfly. I think it makes sense that for reasons like this most ADHD people tend to be kind of asocial. We could be fun and entertaining if we wanted to, but there are too many hard feelings on both sides like why are you such an asshole who never listens to others and on this side why are you all so boring with your stupid ""small talk"" ""hi how are you today?"" crap can't you all say something interesting? So this makes one kinda not good with and not liking people.

Now of course if a product or service would just sell itself... but in my experience entrepreneurship is endless salesmanship. You don't have the advertising budget your corporate competitors have so you network and cold call the living shit out of it, your phone never leaves your hand.

It is also very common that all the failures and negative feedback from others create low self esteem for ADHD people. This means depression and all that. From this angle, lack of a fixed paycheck would be devastating. If you don't trust yourself enough, it does not work. You would be afraif of failure every month.

As for motivation or keeping interested, negative motivation does the job. I have no positive motivation i.e. don't actually like my career, but I am scared shitless what happens and if I would get unemployed and not able to support my family and feel like an utter wreck etc. so that keeps me going.","dd3f9dw",1,1485776513,"2017-01-30 11:41:53"

"8588","Just about to come in and make a snarky comment about ADHD circlejerks and that you are all idiots.

There is no advantages to ADHD, there are no positives, no benefits. If you believe otherwise you are uninformed and in denial.

&gt;I hate always telling people I will do something, then not fucking doing it. I hate how people I care about interpret my actions, or inaction, as malicious or callous or narcissistic. I hate trying so hard to do right, be proper, and recognize what is expected of me, then being called inconsiderate anyway. I hate how fucking hurt and helpless I feel when people I like judge me based things that never crossed my mind. I hate feeling like a failure. And most of all I hate that I’ll be like this forever.

I hate it all too - it's gotten to the point where my wife wanted a divorce and I just fell apart. Every single thing there I've had happen and I'm sick of it. I can count on one hand the number of people I consider ""friends"" - people I could call up out of the blue and ask for a favor. Half a hand would be enough really.

The last few weeks I've decided to just go ""fuck it"", and get on with it. I know I'll screw up, I know it'll be hard, but I want to do so it'll be done. For me personally, and from what I've read, the issues with ADHD involve impulsiveness, distractibility and motivation, so I came up with this method for myself:

1) Stop. Think.  
2) What's important?  
3) Do it. Own the issue.  

It's garbage night - I could do it in the morning, but I probably won't. Stop, think - I know I'll probably forget or be late or whatever in the morning and not have time. What's important? Putting the garbage out. Fuck it, I'll do it now.

Dishes in the sink - Stop, think - it's already pretty late, I'll do it tomorrow. What's important? It can wait, getting enough sleep. Yeah, that'll be OK. Done.

Wife mentions something - maybe something to do, or something to buy. Stop, think - I'll forget this - 100% guarantee that. What's important - not forgetting. Do it - into my notebook it goes. Don't have the notebook? Into my phone, or on my hand, or on a scrap of paper - and then into my notebook.

Step 3 is maybe my favorite - ""Own the issue"" as my friend put it. Stuff like doing the laundry, cleaning up, walking the dogs - just own it. Take control of it. Sure, my wife does it to, but if I'm home first, why not just do it? Own the issue, make it happen - don't do it because you expect something in return, just do it because you can and you should own the problems.

Ever. Single. Little. Thing. It's tiring, but you know what's nice? Getting shit done. Making people happy. Feeling good about myself. Know what's great about lists? Crossing that stuff off. Looking at a list that is nothing but completed tasks - yeah, its dumb I have to jot it all down, but it gets done.

Highlight of the week has to be my little sister-in-law saying to my wife ""he's like a whole different person - what happened?"". Close second is every time my wife says ""thank you"". Third is having an apartment that is squeaky clean.","c9vcekj",66,1368078852,"2013-05-09 05:54:12"
"8589","Some one else said it. Get a good therapist who can teach you how to manage your symptoms for the time being. Diet, exercise, and interesting hobbies too to help you. 

Then when you are old enough, go on your own. 

As much as I don’t agree with your mother’s methods, I can see how the detail of you being an addict (although not sure to what) could be an important detail to a doctor. That could make them think about the right medicine that could be best for you. And that is the ultimate end goal. Maybe try to find a doctor that won’t care about your past and take it seriously that you want help. 

I self medicated with alcohol because it calmed me down after stressful days at work and made my mind quiet. I was very honest with my doctor about how much I drank.

"8591","For me luckily I guess I never found out about my ADHD until later in life. So when I was young I would blurt out stuff but it was mostly intelligent and relevant, if a bit tactless. I was quite unabashed about my witty little brain and wasn't apologetic about it. These impulse replies actually helped me socially. Let's face it, for young children social interractions are quite primal and if you're not bullying (or at least showcase that you can), then you're bullied. My ability to ALWAYS come up with something meaner quickly than whoever tries to verbally abuse me was super useful.

Another observation is that most people tend to watch and filter their words. For me I opt to focus more on my mental state and what I think about. If one always think with empathy, then one's blurt outs will always be socially acceptable, no matter how unfiltered and quick they are. Then of course, when I'm not in a good mood I just shut up.","c9tam36",2,1367821248,"2013-05-06 06:20:48"

This was not a conscious decision for me - it was a straight up survival skill.  It wasn’t until after diagnosis, someone else pointed out how much I’d been compensating without realizing it. 

Also, I’ll add this - pre-diagnosis/pre-meds, what counted as life holding together decently (as I said in the first paragraph) was a very very LOW bar to me. If I could get out of bed in the morning, and survive until my kids went to bed when I could collapse back into my own, I counted it as a win. Now that I have some margin, clarity, and something different to compare it with,I can look back and see how close I was to total exhaustion &amp; collapse.

"8624","I understand what you mean. I think you still do think linearly, but you do it at a level of consciousness that you can't pull answers from. I feel that way about most of my knowledge - I get a feel that something is right or wrong, but I cannot tell you why or where I know it from. Luckily for me, in today's age I can just hop on Google and search based on my knowledge for a source.

I think a good example of your predicament would be common core maths that people make fun of vs the mathematics people who have used it for a long time know. A person who has used maths for decades does not really think about the steps you need to take to do simple addition, subtraction and multiplication but with common core that is often still taught separately. This makes it difficult for people who are experienced to understand it and reason about it well.

The only useful piece of advice I could give you is to reason on paper about such things. This way you can have traceable steps. You could also try to reason linearly yourself: to answer A is I you should be able to document a reason for this. Then document a reason for the prior all the way up (technically you'd do it other way around).

I have similar issues with conversations though - I seem to bring up things which seem to not make sense to people. That is, they do not automatically see the connection. I always figured it was either because I was an idiot (although, since I made the connection I didn't see it, but kept it as a possibility in the back of my mind) or the people I was talking with just couldn't follow me. I never actually thought that it could be ADHD related, but it could make sense - one of the executive functions that ADHD can affect *is* problem-solving.

So I guess I can relate to a degree.

---

On the communication note: I've thought that just the fact that humans can communicate on the level we do is amazing. I mean, we use language that doesn't really hold up scrutiny and a lot of things are context-sensitive and we know not everybody is aware of the same contexts. Yet we can still manage to communicate information so well. I think that we actually overestimate how well our communication works in regards to things such as news and science. I think that's the reason why people want the news to include an indication of how they should feel about certain types of news (eg the death of someone portrayed as a bad thing when it is one), because it reinforces people's understanding of the world and how they should feel about it. After all, if you get the news ""Comcast is offering their new high speed Internet in your area!"" it is pretty difficult to know whether that's a good thing. It seems like one, but if you know about Comcast you'd know it is a bad thing. That is why commentary for news seems rather important - it would tell the people who do not know the context around Comcast how to feel about it. This is why the media can have such a huge effect on people's opinions.

Also, what the hell am I writing about? This is so far removed from where I started at. I'll just keep it for the sake of keeping it.

I've been doing *fine* for the past year or so. Not great, but *fine.* Finally to a point where I didn't feel like a total loser for not being able to do what everyone else could in the exact same way that they did it. It took years to change some of my bad habits and that was without medication. In school it was hard to turn anything in on time even though the assignments were easy. Anything I managed to complete on time would get an A+. I've stayed up nights thinking about every single assignment that I haven't turned in and I have recurring nightmares about not doing/turning in homework. I've been out of school for almost three years now. I had to leave that mess before it destroyed me even though I should have gotten help from the get go. I only recently got help and honestly, just hearing a professional psychiatrist tell me that there's nothing wrong with me, that I'm just wired differently was a huge weight off of my shoulders. Seriously, I felt better almost instantly. I've been on medication only a week and I can already tell that this is the beginning of a new chapter of life for me. I can tell that I don't have to do just *fine* for the rest of my life. I can do well. I can do really, really well. 

First thing you need to do is calm the fuck down, it's going to be okay. Forget about what others are going to think about you and do what's right for you. Go see a psychologist with your concerns.

"8684","First you need to learn how your ADHD subconscious works (what it likes, what it avoids, how it pushes off tasks..), then you can test strategies and use tools to help you. 

So for example, if you notice that you've repeatedly pushed something off that you need to do, ask yourself why your ADHD subconscious doesn't want to do it? (is it difficult, boring, undefined..) 

Ask what's the absolute first step you'd have to take? (find a broom, call for help, look it up online... etc)

Give yourself permission to do it for 5 minutes and stop (you tell your brain this, knowing that starting it is the biggest problem and your brain will likely keep working past those 5 minutes)

I'm building an app to help you use strategies like this, but there are lots other tools and information out there.

"8698","If you don’t mind, I’d like to share a coping mechanism that’s recently started working for me. 

Recently, I came to the realization that’s when my wife asks me to take care of something that’s already on my to-do list, whether it’s “Oh, you’re about to do $task? Don’t forget to also $thing while you’re doing it,” or “Hey, can you do $task today?”, she’s only mentioning it because she too has a brain that processed the same info mine did and came to the same conclusion: $task or $thing needs to be done.

Yay! Both her and I have functioning brains! But why do I feel grumpy when she does that?

Enter my good friend RSD, the little goblin that hides in the back of my psyche and loves to jump out and kick my legs out from underneath me whenever something could be remotely a criticism of me. And his trigger words are “I already asked you to...”, “You forgot to...”, “Why didn’t you...”.

And what comes before “I already asked you to...”, “You forgot to...”, “Why didn’t you...”? Yup, you guessed it: “Don’t forget to also $thing” or “Hey, can you do $task?”

So I’ve associated requests that come from someone else with the RSD goblin making an appearance, and like any good neural network should, I’ve shortcut past the stuff that happens between input (“Can you please...” followed by forgetting) and output (feeling like a total loser who can’t accomplish anything anyway so why even try??). 

Since coming to that realization, whenever my wife asks me to do something that I was already going to do, I congratulate myself on having a brain that came to the same conclusion as her regarding things that are important to do. I then tell myself that the mental shortcut I was taking previously is incorrect, and was just a way to shield myself from possibly forgetting to do the thing and the resultant RSD that would come with it when it was pointed out (again...) that I forgot to do the thing. 

So, TL;DR: When someone asks me to do $thing that’s already on my list, I remind myself that they’re confirming my decision to do $thing (and I thought about it first, so I win :-P ), not setting me up for future failure. 

I can set myself up for future failure all on my own, TYVM.","gr1cmd2",1,1615831306,"2021-03-15 18:01:46"
"8699","At this point I know that I’m always going to end up doing everything at the last minute so I try to prepare for that as best I can. Have the day clear, make sure to get a good nights rest, have proper meals and snacks at the ready (including energy drinks if you need to pull an all nighter). 

I know it’s honestly pretty shitty but you gotta do what works for you. Be prepared for how your body works and don’t fight it, learn to work within the bounds of your ADHD.","gmmctda",1,1612816522,"2021-02-08 20:35:22"

"8702","I suffer from ADHD symptoms as well and I have also low emotional attachment to things or people in general.

However, often I'm emotioanally extremly attached to insignificant events in my environment, which are influencing me directly. Maybe this causes a kind of immunity regarding to other peoples problems and also as self defense.

ADHD patients have often a very sensible valuation system. Just after a few seconds I know if something interests me or not. My brain doesn't support things I'm not interested in or in other words things that are not making me ""high"". 
In 99% I'm not interested in other people because I dont't see benefits, don't see similarities, don't see something which makes me ""high"" or feel better.
Same issue with my mother. I love her. However, when I talk to her or think of her, I also face the same issues of life and especially my life again and again. When I talk to her on the phone, we talk also about my shitty jobs and a lot of other things which gets me down, not ""high"".

Writing this, I realize that maybe pushing away the downs a bit and seeing the highs in everthing could be a good strategy. Your friends moved? See this as opportunity to visit them there and connect it with something which makes you feel good - visiting a new city, stay there for a night while you are on a trip through the country, whatever.

For me the catalyst was my body filling out and my hair starting to gray a little, everyone started putting me in the “adult” category, and started to leave me alone about my quirks. I stopped being a “kid who needs guidance” and started being a “quirky artistic adult” to people.

But I also had time to learn how to operate my body. For example, if I don’t get 15-30 mins of high activity (usually running outside) my brain chemistry is unworkable for anything but sitting around and playing video games.. also I discovered that about half of my depression wasn’t actually depression. Those days when everything is boring and all music sounds bad and good is annoying and everything just sucks... turns out that isn’t depression, that’s my brain throwing a tantrum because it’s craving novelty, and I can satisfy it in surprisingly simple ways like sitting outside for a few minutes.

Actually come to think of it.. outside in general is important.. feed your brain a daily dose of outside novelty. Flip a rock over and look at bugs, dig through a shelf in the barn. Just anything to get some new “content”.","dyt6f0k",3,1526047121,"2018-05-11 13:58:41"

When I start to feel like, “I’ll never make it through this,” I remind myself that most people have imposter syndrome. That said, I do wish I had taken more related classes immediately prior to coming back to school. Every day is a stress and a struggle.

One silver lining that I’ve found to my late diagnosis is that I’m damn stubborn. I have failed at things so many times through my life that I’m really practiced at getting back up and trying again. And I’ll just keep doing that as I try to change my behaviors (currently procrastinating by posting this,) until I graduate. One big thing has changed, though. I don’t think I want to be in academia for the rest of my life. 

Good luck! 

If it’s not too rude of me to suggest, I’d wait until you can get your study skills manageable on undergrad or any even online courses before you go for your PhD. I wish I had taken some hard courses after my diagnosis before applying. I don’t know if the courses are just out of my league, I fell out of school habits, or I never really had study habits b/c I couldn’t even conceive sitting down to work on something just with my concentration.

I now know that all of my studying needs to be active- neurosci = diagrams galore. Also YouTube videos, making outlines, writing flashcards, walking while studying the flashcards, color coding, re listening to lectures while taking notes... but I still find it extremely difficult to figure out what the “key ideas” are, try to study everything, and don’t seem to focus on the right stuff for the exam. 

My advice might just be b/c I’m projecting my insecurities, so take it as you will. Your strengths and challenges are individual and different than mine. You’ll have difficulties w it no matter what, but I do believe we have extraordinary and unique talents that can help you get through a PhD if that’s what you really want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I met someone who is like me, ADHD. But he is stable and slow, and warm and smart in a slow kinda way. He is very personable and people like him. People find me ""prickly"" - I manage my adhd by being a bit autistic - everything needs to be a certain way, I don't interact with/block out a lot of people and have like 3 real friends. There's lots of people I low-key don't like (I'm not mean to anyone,  I just feel like I disappear when i have too many other people in my head) We are both inattentive type but would probably have been diagnosed as combined type when we were younger. He's the opposite personality of mine: genuine, sensitive, caring, very huggable.

I am fascinated by the sciences and have a good understanding of many things and a good grasp of written English, but clumsy af, and struggle to hold down even the easiest, most menial of jobs despite being highly educated (cant hold down a job in a field I studied either). he is dyslexic (hi bby if u are reading this I lv u even if u dont word good heh) and uses reddit to find weird looking penises to send me. I draw smiley faces and arms on them and send them back. We dont have deep conversations, but when we started dating I explained (word-vomited with liquid courage to hep) how very screwed up I was (been in mental hospital, take a bunch of meds, I had to give him my parents number incase I had an episode). 

He has a stable job and I am working hard studying to get a stable job so we an move in together. He is paid a barista's wage because he hasnt finished his approved manager's course that has two questions on a single assesment to go. I'll admit we are both stumped on those questions. its been a year and a half since we started dating and he started the assesment before we got together -  Go Team ADHD! I figure we have about 1.3 fully functional humans between the two of us. 

**I think the point I'm trying to make is that I knew I'd never be able to fool a high-achiever for long. Ive also been me long enough to know that it's not going to get better, so pretending otherwise is lying to myself.** I spent years thinking if only I found the right job, the right medication, got enough sleep I'd be peachy.  Its better to be up front - but **don't word vomit until you feel like the relationship is going somewhere, otherwise it's better to just \*be yourself and let your actions/behaviour do the talking for you\*** 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Look for someone who makes you feel warm, not hyperfocussed**

 A long term relationship consists of a lot more silently cohabitating and small gestures of kindness and warmth than sparkling conversation. You aren't a peacock, you don't need to dance around to attract a hen whom you will impregnate and never see again, you are sizing someone up as a life partner. Don't be fooled by what society says you should be looking for, look for a diamond who has been kicked around a bit but has a heart 3x the size of a regular heart and room for us battered up adhd weirdoes. It might be neurotypical, it might be someone with adhd or other problems of their own. My only caveat is don't be looking for someone to save/save you. Maybe they aren't an olympic swimmer in the sea of life, but they should be able to at least float on their own.

A WORD ON CHEMISTRY

**The kind of people that are fun to chat to aren't necessarily the people that make good partners. There's a certain type of person whom I get \*great\* conversation and chemistry with and in hindsight it tends to be other ADHD'ers or high energy types BUT THEY MAKE TERRIBLE PARTNERS FOR ME!!!!** I think innattentive types have fun with high energy people initially but the hyperactive types drain our battery super fast. And instead of complementing each other (innattentive types or combined types can work or neurotypicals if they are calm and easygoing- they don't disrupt my coping mechanisms with chaos)  ADHD'ers can end up just causing each other exponential problems if the areas they struggle with overlap instead of complement. The trouble with feeding off of someone else's energy is that if they are spiralling you spiral with them.","f7y7qda",1,1574088728,"2019-11-18 14:52:08"

"8763","First of all, thank you for your response!

Being blunt, yes I'm a big suspicious. It's very hard for me to fathom someone being top of their class through HS, and then when things get more difficult for the last semester of college or their first year at work, they suddenly can't function without needing medication.
I'd also argue that the 'things being difficult' is blown out of proportion and a small sample... their GPA went down over one semester, after they had secured their job, mind you... aka they rightfully did not care as much about schoolwork and maintaining their GPA. They've spent a year at work, doing a job that they (and most people) find boring/unexciting. I couldn't blame anyone, ADHD or otherwise, for being easily distracted/unmotivated at work.

The other main symptoms that they claim to be exhibiting is interrupting during conversations, and inability to finish things after getting the ball rolling. I think those are just symptoms of the millennial generation. Everyone thinks what they have to say is important, so they tend to be impatient/interrupt in order to be heard. And as far as not completing things, that's the #1 complaint about millennials in the workforce.

What worries me about medication is exactly what I'm afraid of... 2 worst months of your life? 2 years of experimentation? That gives me nightmares. I don't want them to have to go through that, if the symptoms seem manageable. Unfortunately, SEEMING manageable to a skeptic, and being manageable for the person going through them are entirely different things.

I really do appreciate your comments, and thank you again.

I came home from an epic day. I was exhausted and  little depressed. I flopped down on the couch, starving, but also too tired to make food.


**ADHD boyfriend:** Are you hungry? Can I make you pizza rolls?

**Me:** Oh. My. God. Yes.

**ADHD boyfriend:** (takes pizza rolls out of freezer and goes into the other room)

**Me:** (waits five minutes and then yells to the other room) Hey?! Pizza roll chef?

**ADHD boyfriend:** (comes back into the room) Sorry. Got distracted. (pours out pizza rolls into dish and puts dish into microwave. Does not turn on microwave. Goes into the other room.

**Me:** (doesn't realize microwave isn't on. Ten minutes go by) Hey?! Pizza dude? Where are my pizza rolls?

**ADHD boyfriend:** (Comes back in) Oh man. I'm so sorry. Adderall has worn off. (presses start on the microwave and goes back into the other room).


The microwave goes off. I know the pizza rolls aren't going to be done but at this point, I suck it up, get off the couch flip the pizza rolls, wait the extra minute and them take them out and go back to the couch. He comes back in and sees me eating pizza rolls and says ""Oh man, sorry, I totally would have gotten those for you."" I tell him ""thanks, I know"" and offer him some pizza rolls.

This story was not a big deal. Pizza rolls. 

But, things like this will happen ALL THE TIME. No matter what systems you have in place or how good your communication is. You can positively encourage and love him very much, but you have to understand on a very deep level what you are signing up for. 

Sounds dramatic, but I've heard enough stories from him about people that think they know what they're in for and then.....don't really know.

I started with just wondering wtf was wrong with me, then to just thinking it was some regular, random depression, then I started asking why would I be depressed. Then I noticed I had really bad social anxiety, again wondered how. Then I thought I might have OCD, but nope. Then I thought autism, nope (well close I guess, ADHD and autism seem similar) and then I finally thought it might be ADHD and did some research, and my brother has it. 

Then it finally hit me, it has to be fuckin ADHD. Seeing people's experiences and symptoms made me finally feel some comfort, I actually teared up when I had my revelation. Still have yet to be diagnosed because my doctor is on maternity leave but I will be blown away if it isnt ADHD. I'm 20 now btw.

How many capsules in the prescription, and how long is it intended to last?  

Honestly, 10mg sounds like a really cautious approach, whereas 20mg may sound more aggressive, but seems more reasonable to me.   Why prescribe a dosage that's rarely ever strong enough?

20mg of lis-dex (i.e. Vyvanse) is not as powerful as 20mg of IR or XR Dex.   
It's not remotely a high dose at all, and 10mg is probably barely noticeable to someone with ADHD.   
If you did notice it, it would probably be only enough to feel annoyingly ineffective.

Where I am at now sort of organically grew out of that. I kept pushing because I wanted to make things better at work, make improvements I saw that could be made that my position at the time really had no power to do. Found that I was actually sort of good at that sort of thing. Pushed more, and took my current job when the opportunity presented itself, not sure if it was a good move (it actually was, thankfully!).

"8803","As a kid my mom refused to medicate me, and I wasn’t medicated until high school.

While my symptoms never improved to the level they do while taking a stimulant med, the absolute next best treatment for me is rigorous exercise.

When I have a moderate to intense workout 3-4 times a week (I swam very competitively growing up) my symptoms were entirely more manageable.


There’s evidence to back this up as well, as both stimulant medications and exercise release dopamine, the main factor in symptom improvement with ADHD.

A story I like to point to is Michael Phelps, the US Olympic swimmer who broke the gold medal record. He was diagnosed with ADHD and his mother encouraged him to swim and train every day and his level of intensity was so strong that he was able to manage his symptoms without medication, and then become one of the worlds greatest athletes.

Hope this helps! Maybe you and your son can make a routine and turn exercise into a fun activity you do together, it’s not just healthy for people with ADHD!","evkxlf8",1,1564587798,"2019-07-31 15:43:18"

"8833","Unfortunately, you're not wrong here. I wrote about my similar experiences on this sub months back elaborating something similar, but it got buried to page 2 by the following morning. If I had to make an educated guess just by the average number posts talking about functioning in school alone, I would argue that most of the individuals who post here are teens and young 20 somethings.

For the 30+ folks it becomes much more difficult to relate to most of those issues since the problems we face are more complex and increase with age. Mortgages. Marriages. Kids. Bills. Physical health and not just the mental aspect. Increased accountability. Less room for flexibility. Less TIME! My god we have so little time at the end of the day.

And because of all of these factors, we don't have time to browse Reddit let alone make a post. In the 2½ years I've been browsing this sub, I've yet to encounter a single post post from someone older than me who has found any sort of meager success or overcame the anxiety and depression that goes along with the ADHD. And I contribute this to probably because they're homeless or too broke to even pay for Internet access. Statistically speaking: if you grew up poor and in a dysfunctional family, and in an environment that wasn't conducive to your upbringing, you are more likely to be homeless or end up in prison because you went undiagnosed your entire life. *citation needed*

I consider it a success just by discovering this subreddit alone because at least some of you guys took the initiative and put enough research in that it led you to here, as trivial as this sounds. There's currently 28,189 users subscribed to this sub as of writing this post, and there's millions more who never heard even heard of /r/ADHD and probably millions more who will go undiagnosed their entire lives.

Which is pretty ironic because I sometimes cruise the /r/bipolar sub every now and then just to gain some insight and clarity, and I it the culture there much more sound and full of good advice at dealing with their disorder. I could argue our ADHD prevents us from being able to plan out and break things down easily in the first place, so naturally their wisdom is more salient and progressive. But also I see a lot more adults contributing to the discussions which helps so much more because their wisdom pays dividends to the younger generation giving them the ability to plan out their future by learning from the older adults mistakes and their invaluable unique insight on adult life. Something this sub sorely lacks at times. This is not to say they don't exist however. I'll hear a mother of 37 years talking about her troubles at home with the husband and 2 children with ADHD and she gets great advice, but they're so few are far in-between, because like I said, there's very few users in the sub who can relate.

I can only speak for myself of course, but over time this sub has become a litany of circle jerk posts of, ""You are describing me"" and ""I need help with this class"" and while I'm not advocating they should stop, but sometimes it would be nice have a psychiatrist chime in every now and then so that they can break down the neurology and chemistry to uninformed people. I understand the legal ramifications of why they don't but hell... even an anonymous pdoc would be great to hear every now and then, they sure as hell aren't shy on /r/psychology. It's so rare to get an expert on here that it's no surprise that we're left to diagnose ourselves which in my experience can be dangerous. It would also be helpful if there were more articles that showed the latest news on ADHD, but most they're just the usual Dr. Barkley videos and articles which are pretty dated anyways. But hey, I can't complain very much about that, they're informative and those deserve re-ups.

As of August I unsubscribed from this sub simply because I wasn't gaining anything new that wasn't already being said 1 year ago, and also because my life hasn't changed for the better. In fact it has gotten worse, but that's a story which I don't like sharing. I'll drop by ever few weeks like I have this morning, and I am only responding to this post because fuck it, why not beat this dead horse some more, the medication is still keeping me awake anyways. It's just unfortunate that so many of us feel this way and I wish I had an answer to ameliorate all the reasons why. I mean it's pretty obvious what we need to do, we just never follow through with them. The tips and techniques I've learned here though have been invaluable to me, and I wish I could have used them 14 years ago when they were necessary, but I'm sorry to say they're not as effective as I'm an adult now, but that is also contributed by the external problems of today's economy and to a larger extent with society, but that is a whole other conversation and I'm not even gonna tap into that. 

Like I said, this is just my own point of view so treat it as as such. And sorry if I don't make a TLDR because this post probably wasn't for you anyways, so you might as well skip it.","cktvhjj",6,1411820902,"2014-09-27 12:28:22"

I’m a sensitive person who experiences emotions intensely, so I do get it, but negative emotions won’t kill us, we can handle them. Accept that you might get hurt. 

You can’t control if she rejects you. You can’t control that you have ADHD. You can control whether or not you ask her out or whether or not you tell her you like her. You can’t control how she responds. 

The best thing you can do for yourself is identify the things you can control, the things you have a choice about, and make the best choice. Then with the things you can’t control, you can accept them and you can do so knowing you controlled what you could.

It sounds like she likes you! Also, I appreciate your honesty in this post, I can relate and I bet most humans could relate, probably even this girl.

To be honest, my actual GPA for the 3rd quarter of my senior year was an actual 0.0. Yep. That's how bad it got.

"8870","Your story definitely strikes a tone with me and my personal experiences. It's essentially this feeling that your family is full of geniuses and that you'd never be able to match that level of prestige because of ADHD, which I can absolutely relate to. 

My parents attended the most prestigious engineering school in China before traveling to the US to get their PhDs in the top engineering program in their field at the time. My dad has an obsession with math and always hoped that it would reflect upon his children. When I was growing up, he would always compare me to my older sister, who, as time went on, became pretty much an impossible standard. I showed promise earlier on, but high school was a nightmare as I slid from the top of the class to simply an average student, which to me felt like failure. As I was struggling to hand in assignments and get myself to study, my sister was studying engineering at MIT. She went on to graduate with a perfect GPA after getting near-perfect grades in high school too - allowing her to get into pretty much any grad school or job position she would want. Meanwhile, my paltry GPA was bolstered by strong standardized test scores and I managed to make it to a decent school - just not one anywhere on the level of my family. 

I think that my family's values has reflected strongly on what I believe is success. My only goal in college now is to work hard, get good grades, good internships, put myself at the top of the class, then figure out what I want to do with my life. I also suffer a lot from social comparison bias: I feel a lot of resentment toward people who are better than me in some way. I struggle to put away failures and my mood is largely based off of my current academic performance. I feel actual hatred toward people who are from ivy league-level schools, perceiving them to be what I could have been. 

As you can tell, I can't provide any kind of solution to the problem given that I'm still putting myself through this struggle. The other comments in this thread make some great suggestions on how to change your idea of ""adequacy"". Good luck.

Long story short... lots of estrogen = less adhd symptoms.  Lack of estrogen = super adhd.  

Estrogen will be at its lowest between 2 weeks before to right before your period starts.  Mine is the entire week before.  

Once you start you should feel better mentally on the second day of your flow.  That is when estrogen starts to build back up.

It's no way to live.  I didn't even really realize the part about ignoring almost all the personal care until I became medicated.

I've only gotten where I am today by working 14-20 hours a day, 5-7 days a week with the occasional complete crash where I recharge my batteries and accomplish absolutely nothing for a day while people think I'm being super productive as usual.

Being medicated now, I accomplish way more in less time and even take care of personal things.  I haven't caught up my entire life yet but it is seeming achievable for once in my life.

Sometimes, you have to admit you don't want to have the social interactions. Faking it is sometimes shallow, like you described, other time you can fake it to make it. That's why there is a socially awkward penguin meme! It's not just you, rest assured.

It pains me to read this post. I feel ya, I really do.

The self doubt, the external expectations you want to fulfill but find cloying, the Negative Nancy mental hamster running the world around you into the ground with no apparent escape. It's rough. You CAN make it out of the spiral!

Sounds like depression, or anxiety, or something, man. Seek some help, professional or personal, and talk about this with someone you trust. Even if it's via the anonymity of the Unternet, here. You have reached out here, and that's a great step. Pat yourself on the back for that, ok? Some people never take that leap. We're a really sympathetic, understanding, and encouraging sub that wants to see you happy and engaged with your life. For me, hearing ""Me too!"" eases me out of my headspace and back to being the social butterfly my base personality is.

If you are open to the idea of meditation, search my comment history from today. I detailed how I do it and it really helps me out of the downward spiral that fucking mental hamster likes to take me on. Sometimes you have to kick that fucker in the teeth, other times you have to feed it sunshine and crayons!

Anyway, keep talking. Keep exploring your inner workings. Keep digging till you find your core.","c8iuxyt",5,1361415758,"2013-02-21 03:02:38"

"8923","Your mum could be closed minded about it, which isnt on you at all.

To play devils advocate though, it might be how she genuinely feels, and for good reason. ADHD is thought to be highly genetic, so it is not unlikely that a parent would have varying degrees of symptoms. It is also the case that your mum would fall into a category where there is no way she would ever have been diagnosed. As a result she genuinely believes it is normal, because it is normal for her.

My dad was surprisingly (and to a degree still is) skeptical of my diagnosis when i was 31. He is super open minded about mental health so it caught me off guard. It then became suppper obvious he had ADHD too, but he is 62, he was never going to have been diagnosed as an immigrant kid in the 60s and 70s in Australia. I realised that yeah, to him it is just 'normal' because it is his normal. 

The wanting to change is probably how she dealt with it as well, there was no medication on offer, no diagnosis, and no understanding it is a condition and not a behavioural trait you can just change. 

My dad now seems to get that he probably has ADHD, but he is also quite skeptical still, even though his social group are not. There is a good chance at least one of your parents have ADHD to some degree, and if they have just lived with it, they probably think it is 'normal'","ep3lc38",2,1559024715,"2019-05-28 06:25:15"

"8950","I disagree. I don’t understand your point about cancer. 

I think there is some good advice here, but ADHD requires a diagnosis. Undiagnosed is meaningless. It’s not a philosophical issue of having ADHD then being diagnoses with it. It’s a complex medical condition that requires thorough differential diagnosis. Until then it can be anything from a vitamin deficiency to an under-active thyroid to depression to bipolar disorder to a learning disability to a million under conditions. Whether or not you can get diagnosed right now has nothing to do with the fact that “undiagnosed ADHD” is not ADHD. 

OP is talking about not having meds - when I’m speculating they have never been on these meds for a condition they don’t know if they have - or if the medication will even work. If this sub has led people to seek out a formal diagnosis, great. But there are bigger issues at play for the entire community and that’s treating this disorder as a diagnosed medical condition. The stigma around ADHD is that people don’t think it’s real or take it seriously. Saying you have a disorder that a qualified medical professional hasn’t diagnosed you with is bad for all of us.","foruq4h",1,1588018848,"2020-04-27 20:20:48"

","c4ntchg",7,1336987717,"2012-05-14 09:28:37"
"8957","I can help with the prescription part:

As you noted, 40mg is the maximum dosage for the standard permit so your doctor can only prescribe you to take 40mg per day.


You can get 300 tablets (3x100 tablet bottles) per refill - and each refill will cost you approx $36


The max amount of repeats for each prescription is 4. So you fill the script once, and you get four repeats. 


So you shouldn't have to go every week - if you're taking 40mg/day then a 300 tablet, 4 repeat script should last just over a month. 


If you're worried about costs, does your doctor do bulk billing? Some doctors have a bulk billing wait list that you can ask to be put on, but many are also stopping it :/


I find Chemist Warehouse has the cheapest prices for medication - you can look online at their prices. I find it's best to go consistently to one chemist so that they know you (as it's a schedule 8 medication etc etc) 


Australia also has Ritalin (it comes in foil, not a bottle) and if you were diagnosed with ADHD before the age of 18, then Concerta is available on the PBS. Otherwise, it's about double the price. Check chemist warehouse prices to see :)

Vyvanse is even more expensive, but I don't have any experience with that so I can't say what the PBS reqs for that is like.


It's interesting that you're taking it every 4 hours tbh. How quickly did you go upwards?


It's definitely having an effect on you, but a bad effect. You don't want to be crashing or experiencing depressive symptoms. I'd be inclined to say try a different medication, but that's up to your doctor. 

How long does it take for the meds to kick in if it lasts you only 45min to 1 hr?

Also, when you're expecting it to work, what exactly are you expecting?

I was put on 5mg twice a day for one week, then 10mg for a week, then 15mg, then 20mg, and finally 25mg in the morning and 15mg in the afternoon.
I found only when I got to 25mg that I could actually feel the meds helping me, but it ended up being all too much for me. My sleep was shot, anxiety through the roof (which I had never had before) and I struggled to be in a good mood. So I dropped myself down to 15mg twice a day even though it hadn't worked when I was starting out, and whilst it hasn't allowed me to be 100% totally focused or function normally (if there is such a thing as normal), it has given me a slight edge over my adhd. 

I mean, I can't sit down for an hour and just work, but I'm less likely to forget a towel when going to shower and I can drive more carefully or can push myself to pay attention during a conversation etc etc.



It's possible your expectations are way too high. It shouldn't be a fist in the face. Imho it shouldn't even be a motivated totally focused feeling either, instead possibly shouldn't even feel it there. That's why at least a week per dosage is a good way to gauge it as it gives you time to see how it's really affecting your day to day.


For some people, medication isn't going to be a miracle worker. I really, really hope it is for you, but you might have to be part of team euhedralandalusite sorry :/

I don't actually know where I was going with this, but I hope something here may have helped :)



Also, you can't sleep? I think 20mg is probably already too much, especially combined with that anxiety","d1wq8by",1,1460247175,"2016-04-10 00:12:55"

the multi-core processor is the best analogy i have so far, because it's like my brain is different than a normal persons brain, (let's call them dual-core peeps)- when they have 8 tabs open on their computer, the computer can only focus on one (assuming the other core is taking care of essential background computer functions) tab at a time, so while you're loading one website all the others are ""put on hold"" (although technically this is also determined by RAM, so let's just say my computer has a nice 16gb of ram to hold all that random shit going on all at once) -  it with ADHD my mind is too good at doing lots of stuff at once that it doesn't put my plans to find the center of the universe on hold while also listening to my math teacher teach.

Here is my method.
   if you can answer the questions in sets of answering technique, skipping questions for later if your going to use a different approach.
  First time through, catch easy ones by only reading the question and ignoring your options, write it down if you need.
  Second time reading questions you will confirm your written response, then on the remaining options eliminate options you know are wrong.
  third time through you will do calculations and look up any needed references if it's open book.
   finally, you will double check all answered questions and guess on any remaining options.

ALTERNATIVELY: just be super adhd like me, do a bunch of shit and finish nothing. Find some new game, play it for a couple hours and never again. Think of a new program, finish it half way and leave it. Watch a few episodes of a TV show and then never again.

It's not so bad living this way, you don't have to be like everyone else. Eventually you pick up momentum on something. It's kind of like ""skimming the surface of life from one new impulse to the next"". ","cvon05d",1,1444021446,"2015-10-05 05:04:06"

"9024","I’m 35. Already started mid life crisis with my neck stenosis diagnoses 


That’s interesting. I’d love to hear more ? 

I was in corporate setting 

As time passed, I would from time to time express how I was annoyed cos I didn’t have time to get to the gym and how I love being in shape cos of the way my clothes fit but again not a body issue for me, I knew I’d get there just had to move my schedule around and I loved eating so still did that.

All of a sudden I start hearing all “OMG you’re fine!!!!!! Don’t ever let anyone tell you that!!!”

Tell me what?

Yes I’m fine. But there’s always a better that we work toward, a goal, an accomplishment, not better per say but just some place where you wish to go. Plus it releases my stress. That does not equate body issues.

Then this female coworker was like “um... you know how many calories that is right if you wish to lose weight?”

Um. First of all. I don’t want to lose weight, I just enjoy being in good shape. Secondly I know exactly what I’m eating and how many calories it is and it’s actually part of my diet when I workout. 

I don’t do crash diets I don’t calorie count. I lift and I eat. And I eat well. And when I eat I don’t like to be interrupted.

Again, no body issues there.

I was so sick of how one thing where you like eating healthy and are into fitness would be misconstrued by ones own fears and judgements. 

And this is the thing too. I’m not a crazy fitness nazi. I just eat healthy but I hell eat! But I make sure to look good while doing it! :p


No offence to any ladies out there. I know how tough weight loss is, been through it in the past. Just don’t like being mistaken for what my words actually mean.

"9043","&gt;One question, you have some info about The use of wellbutrin and ritalin ( methylphenidate ) for adhd in The same person? Is it good, bad?

It can be either Good and Bad.

Using them together is like getting a higher dose of either medication.  They have synergistic effects.

* So it may give you better ADHD treatment

* It may also give you worse ADHD treatment for if you go too high of dose of ADHD meds you actually see a decrease of focus.  (What is too high is dependent on the person due to genetics.)

* It may also increase the risk of side effects for the drugs are similar enough.  Thus you may get a higher chance of seizures with wellbutrin and methylphenidate than wellbutrin alone at that same dose (the higher the dose the higher the risk of seizures), same thing with agitation, irritability, etc.

----

But there is no ""real"" special interaction with this drugs like you creating a toxin in your body or your liver can't process both drugs at the same time.  It is just more dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake.  There are advantages and disadvantages of doing both drugs at once vs a higher dose of a single drug.  One such thing is that the wellbutrin does not wear off after hours so less of a crash but more of a chance of insomnia, and harder to eat since  wellbutrin does not wear off.

"9058","# There is no debate. *Both are tremendously beneficial!*

But there is no ambiguity whatsoever that ritalin and adderrall significantly reduce the symptoms of ADHD. The science is definitive on this point.

If you have doubts about the expensive Concerta or Vyvanse, try plain adderrall or ritalin first. Concerta is a long-release improved version of ritalin, and vyvanse an extended release improved version of adderrall.

Also, the ADHD drug market is small. If drug makers thought there was that much money to be made selling drugs to us, there would be a lot more companies developing drugs to treat ADHD. 

And counseling is tremendously helpful with the **numerous comorbid issues** that tend to come along for the ride. The effects of ADHD go beyond your ability to focus moment-to-moment. Get treatment for those too.

Being diagnosed late in life sucks, but it may have been beneficial in forcing me to find these coping skills on my own. I know how smart I am, I've been told my entire life I'm capable of anything, etc... So I am always fighting so hard to overcome my shortfalls. 
I am grateful I didn't fall into addictions or risky sexual behaviors, and severe depression. Hearing stories of those ADHDers who were undiagnosed as well breaks my heart. ","dzuqeom",3,1527725862,"2018-05-31 00:17:42"

Exercise is obviously a boon for your mental health no matter what, but what makes an exercise-related class so huge for an adhd sufferer is that you only have to show up. 

You don't have to worry about anything at all as long as you show up, you just do what your instructor says and watch the results come in and see yourself feel better after each class. As an added bonus, my thoughts are clearer the day after class. It is like a 2nd medicine, I swear by it now and am pissed I injured myself recently and can't go.

It takes a while sometimes but once you find the right concoction everything is entirely worth it. Just stick with it, don't give up. 

If you don't do well with Adderall you're more likely to do better with Ritalin/Concerta. They're a different family of amphetamines and if one doesn't work, the other family is usually the answer.

I dont think op was trying to say it i wrong to relate.

I personally spend more time in r/asperger which is my other diagnosis and I notice this a lot, and I think it is a problem because people further alienate themselves by thinking everything they do is weird and that their whole identity is based upon that diagnosis.

The intention isn't to say your problems are not real, it is to say you are still a human being and don't obsess to much about how this diagnosis makes you different from others.

At the end of the day you dont need a diagnosis to justify what you can or cant do, if you know you cant do something or find it too hard you should take your experience more seriously and not pay attention to people when they call you lazy","gwsbf3z",2,1620051959,"2021-05-03 14:25:59"

I've only ever had one psychiatrist (at keiser) ever request a drug test. You may try finding another psychiatrist (ask your friends who they go to) if you can. Another option may be to see if your general practice doctor would prescribe meds to you since you have already been diagnosed or at least they may be able to suggest a good psychiatrist to you. The last option is just not to smoke pot for a couple weeks and pass the drug test so you can move forward. But it sounds like meds may be a good option for you since you feel like you are still struggling.

[GIVE ME A KICKSTARTED SANDBOX COMPANY AND I'LL BE A MILLIONAIRE.]

Sometimes I'm convinced this is true. When I'm optimistic, I can daydream for hours about being a CEO/founder to a ""Create-a-job"" company. Google-esque office building, smart glass walls to create open space and retain privacy if desired, job interviews consisting of ""Hello, what do YOU think you can do if we gave you a sandbox and top tier materials to play around with?""

'Employees' would get a private office with a desk, computers, virtual reality gear, whiteboards, physical mind maps, a table to craft on, a music installation, headphones, eyemasks and earbuds (no, not for kinky purposes - to block the senses so they can *think*). 


A support team. 


- One person who will have their back even if they cost the entire company a million because of an ADHD oops. 


- One person who will accept the challenge of turning the lost million into a two million game because. It's. A. Challenge. Duh. 


- One person who antagonizes,  who yap yap yaps and says ""how about no"" to all your ideas until you want to skewer their eyes on your fountain pen - until then they tell you: ""Ha, just kidding John, I'm game. We're doing this."" 


- a simulation room. Earthquakes, tornadoes, inferno's, avalanches, motor vs. car chases, free falls. Anything to kick you into seventh gear, anything for the thrill and the adrenalin. Exit the room and conquer. the. world. 


- One to fight with. To bark at. To let out everything you've been keeping in because you have to be the better person and swallow all the misconceptions about ADHD, Autism, dyslexia, dyscalulia and whatever you have been diagnosed with. Because there will always be people who don't get it, and sometimes you have to yell and scream and pull your hair from your scalp and doing to empty space does. not. cut. it.","ehq0yfk",1,1551647154,"2019-03-03 21:05:54"

"9156","I would score within the top 1% of the nation on standardized tests. I failed so many classes that I spent every summer in summer school from 8th grade until 11th grade. I once had 3 straight months of detention in 6th grade for refusing to do homework day after day.

The teachers never realized that I was anything more than a serious pain in the ass, ""does not apply himself"" was a permanent entry on my report cards. I, however, always knew for a fact that I wasn't like everyone else; not that I was more intelligent, or especially bright or anything, just that I didn't belong. There was nowhere on the planet that I would be able to fit in. I liked it that way, but resented how much more difficult it made my life.

I somehow ended up as Sous Chef in a professional kitchen over a staff of 75 cooks several years down the line. It was overwhelming for me, to say the least. The work itself wasn't too overwhelming for me, it was all of the organizational and interpersonal responsibilities that crushed me. I couldn't take it any longer: I had to see a therapist. I was racked with constant anxiety, even when ""relaxing."" It was no way to live a life.

During my very first visit, at age 30, the therapist brought up ADHD when we were discussing my school years. She drew the lines between my problems and the symptoms of ADHD, and referred me to a local ADHD specialist to be tested.

I scored within the top few percentages of that test, too! Only that means that I have a ""thing"" now. The first 6 months were pretty tough to cope with; I never saw it coming. The more I would research and learn, the more I would reflect on my past and see ADHD just glaring right back at me. I felt like I had wasted 20 years of my life.

After the initial crush, though, my life began coasting into what has by far been the most positive and productive years of my life. I may have wandered aimlessly trying to please everyone else with my direction in the past, but now I finally have the tools I need to accomplish the things that I've always known were my real goals.

"9164","Hello! There are a couple possible reasons why this could be happening. 

1. the adhd brain perceives time differently and lives very in the present and gets used to the current way of life super quickly. Any changes from getting a haircut, taking a new route to work, even making progress In treatment can be adjusted to extremely quickly and soon perceived as the new normal. You forget what things used to be like and your brain kinda just goes yep this has always been this way. So this could possibly be what’s happening 

2. also many times when getting on adhd meds the first week or so can feel really great simply because things are finally a little easier. The problem is sometimes the adhd brain gets disproportionately excited about this and doesn’t look at it realistically. Then when the reality of how meds are (they help a little but need other treatment as well to be most effective) kicks in, the persons like wait these meds don’t do anything.

3. you could actually need a higher dose. However if they felt like they were working at the start it’s a way higher chance that the first two things I listed are happening instead. However there’s no downside in checking in with your psychiatrist about this. 

Meds a super tricky, I wish you the best of luck!","gixp3ce",2,1610404656,"2021-01-11 22:37:36"
"9165","I find it more effective than methylphenidate. Of course, individual differences may decide what is best for him, but I was on extended release methylphenidate for 6 months after starting a new job (my adderall wasn't lasting through the last 1.5 hours of my 9.5 hour shift) and had limited benefit. It was better than nothing, though.

The effects of mixed amphetamine salts (the generic name for adderall) last around 7-9 hours, depending on individual. Of course, it is likely there will be a bit of getting used to it, but it isn't TOO different from methylphenidate. He might find that he gets angry easier than normal or perseverates (staying on task after one would generally give up and try a different approach) more than currently, but depending on how the methylphenidate affects him, it may be less. I would implore you to give him as much time as possible before the school year starts again. At least one week, two weeks would be better.","ctxgh0u",2,1439168687,"2015-08-10 01:04:47"

It is not todays culture in my demographic for the planning/marshalling work to be done by one person. Nor should it be. 

I wonder also about having the kind of money to delegate tasks - the ""house science"" as i call it, the personal assistant, the career assistant? Working in teams which support neurodiversity? I wonder how my self-esteem would have fared then? 

Because right now it's a slow road back to feeling okay about myself when functionality has been so impaired. The upside of a (late) adult diagnosis is being a good warning signal for younger people, and easily rebutting people who dismiss the impact of it.

"9188","I crawled out the other end, but I have done all of the above. I was doing it because I was totally overwhelmed, and the stress was making me lock up mentally, so I would sleep because I was exhausted trying to fight the overwhelm-ness of every day, and I would fall more and more behind because I *needed* to take a nap instead of doing assignments (I couldn't stay awake, or wake up). Rinse and repeat.

Also, college is much less structured than all previous school. They assume that you will carry over whatever organizational skills you got in kindergarten/elementary/middle/high school and move on. Profs don't coordinate finals and projects so they don't bump into each other (a form of time management assistance), and you are responsible for getting yourself to school - no one will hold you accountable or help you. So if you don't have a good foundation, or don't have the discipline to continue what you used to do, you will suffer.

After 4 years of half-assing and scraping by, I looked at my performance history and noticed that I did better after dropping a class. So I begged my parents to let me drop to part time (12-15 credits to 9 credits per semester); after I did, I was much happier and much less overwhelmed, and thus more likely to go to class because I wasn't internally panicking before class from being overwhelmed. That's how I graduated.

Turns out the college pace isn't my pace; it takes more effort and time for me to absorb information than some people. I could tirelessly haul ass for the first month of school, but I felt like if I wasn't 100% every day, which no one is, then I would fall impossibly behind. All it took was one day, and my whole semester was screwed. When I dropped my course load, even if I had fallen behind a day, I had enough time to catch up in my three classes. And if I was on track, I had time to enjoy the other aspects of my life, which kept my mood up and frustration low, which resulted in more motivation - even if it was forced motivation lol.","d34fu2g",6,1463168468,"2016-05-13 19:41:08"

"9202","""Hyperfocus"" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD.

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

"9205","The core problem that ADHD victims face is motivation. The reward centers of our brains are wired wrong, so unless an activity offers immediate reward, like tv, video games, and going back to bed, it is unsettlingly difficult to motivate ourselves. This is why reading a book for a homework assignment can be nearly impossible, but reading for enjoyment is easy. I have a solution (at least what's worked for me). I've always been the classic case of high potential - low performance. The majority of my academic failures have stemmed from an inability to get shit done. It wasn't until recently that I found my edge: competition. I can motivate myself by basically tapping into years of frustration. I use this to create a ""reward"" for myself. If I craft a paper that I'm confident will be the best in the class, then that will make me feel really good. I dangle that sense of pride (and ego) in front of myself like a carrot, and it works quite well. In retrospect, I've been unintentionally doing this to myself with English classes for years, but now that I've recognized it, I've started applying it to everything else, and it's worked quite well.

"9207","Hey, I just wanted to put you in perspective: I live in a country where ADHD (especially adult ADHD) is NOT a thing AT ALL. Like, even the best and closest to ADHD area neurologists/psychiatrists DO NOT recognize adult ADHD as a real thing. There is NO way I can get ANY treatment here except for what some really third-4th line, off-label meds I can find and get my hands on in here. For example, I'm taking Bromantane and Stablon right now, not sure if it's helping much, but at least it MAY help from what I researched online. 

So yeah, as I know in Canada it's not as big of a struggle to get proper diagnosis and treatment. Get your ass up and do what should be done. Go and spend some time (maybe you can't find a good doctor in 1 day, but you can do a few steps towards your goal of getting diagnosed, medicated and going thru psychotherapy for a new beginning of your life).

November of 2019 I had just finished up a year of therapy with an ADHD specialist, and had just worked out the right dosage on some new meds with my new psychiatrist.  In Feb 2020 I probably had the most control over my ADHD then I ever have had in my entire life.  Then boom, tons of mental hard work lost.

First two weeks were vacation.  Then months of anxiety.  They constantly gave us vague instructions that we definitely had to do but also probably could get away with not doing but definitely should and also the instructions will certainly change at a moments notice.  Such a complete lack of order and structure was a nightmare. For me the worst part is they told us that we were responsible for contacting the parents of our homeroom kids to explain what was happening (even though that DEFINITELY seems like something the admin should be doing, but sure).  I have mild phone anxiety, but that coupled with the lack of direction gave me straight up panic attacks for the first time.  Like, living with ADHD I always believed logically that people with GAD were telling the truth but like... it's one of those you have to see it to believe it things, you know? And after feeling like my head was on fire, like my body was burning up, and my wife touching me and reassuring me I wasn't, and it STILL persisting (plus the trouble breathing, dizziness, etc.) I definitely believe our brothers and sisters with GAD now.  


At the end of the summer though we rearranged my office/video games and entertainment room and our craft room next door so that all my office stuff is in a new, different space.  Sticking to schedules even when it makes not sense.  It's been working more or less, though the work is piling up.... though I did have a very productive day today!

Choose a music album that you don't mind listening to every morning (I used movie and video game soundtracks). Have the album autoplay when your alarm goes off and keep the music going until you walk out the door.

"9306","I read in a neuroscience book (I am pretty sure that it was written by Daniel Amen) that some people with ADHD subconsciously seek out high risk (like working at the last minute since the time pressure helps them work better), somewhat confrontational and even rude behaviors (ex: they'll banter or tease others for no real reason), or create disruptive situations (ex: moving around when they should not be like in a classroom) because it stimulates the emotional centers of their brain and this ultimately activates their Prefrontal Cortex (which is usually less active in brains of people with ADHD). 

So actually, being in those kinds of conflicting, emotionally charged, stressful situations helps some people with ADHD focus and concentrate. Generally, this kind of behavior is or borders on being disruptive so it's not really behavior that helps the person get along with others or maintain their jobs or studies.

When they can't find this kind of external stimulation, they turn to looking for strong enough internal stimulation by worrying and ruminating, focusing on problems, anger, and other negative emotion. Doing this is another way for them to make their brains function at the level they want it to. It gets complicated bc it might be that they have these kinds of thoughts because of preexisting conditions like depression or maybe these thought patterns exacerbate their depression/anxiety etc. The bottom line is that the stimulation has to be strong enough to cause a significant enough chemical change in their brains and it's generally easier to do that when it is negative stimulation.

It's not that they do it because they want to hurt themselves or others but after a lifetime of untreated ADHD, their brains have found a behavior pattern that seems to work at least in the short term when nothing else ever has and so it becomes a kind of instinctive fallback course of action.

I imagine these kinds of feelings, subconscious thoughts or habits would not just disappear because of a pill...In my case, I benefited from really taking a look at why I do some things instead of just writing them off as being due to ADHD. For example: After starting my medication, I no longer had as much difficulty with concentration or attention yet I would put off doing work until the last minute. I realized that for years, the anxiety and fear that resulted from the pressure of not having enough time helped me bang out some very good quality work so somehow, I started associating doing well with putting off stuff until I got freaked out enough. Unfortunately, you adapt to things, even anxiety causing things very easily so eventually I go to the point where it was impossible for me to finish in time no matter how hard I worked. Thus, taking medication didn't miraculously stop me from procrastinating on important assignments even though I no longer needed that kind of stressful environment to be able to concentrate. 

Not saying you have this issue but I do think you can look into your actions and explore this possibility and perhaps look into discussing this in therapy. 

Also, it could be that you don't need the medication and might instead benefit from an ADHD coach since you do not like the way the medication changes your personality. It might also be a matter of trying different types of medicine since you might react differently.","ckklrkp",5,1410930883,"2014-09-17 05:14:43"

I recommend you go see a doctor. It might help taking with you someone who knows you well and lives with you. Do you have a girfrind/boyfriend/wife/husband/mother/... that can go with you? Sometimes a person that can confirm information about your behavior may give the doctor the confirmation he needs.

If you intend to (and I advise you to do it) talk to your doctor about cannabis, I recommend that you take a prescription with you to show to the doctor.

If you are not satisfied, try another doctor. There's nothing wrong with that. I myself had to try a few before finding a doctor that respected and understood adhd.

"9359","This happens to me, even with medication, although medication helps manage the crashes and keep me from getting derailed.  It's been made 10000x worse by lockdown life.  The things that have typically helped me stay focused and productive with or without medication are setting firm boundaries between work and home life and creating work rituals to keep me motivated (i.e. going to a favorite campus spot or cafe to write, taking a walk or getting a tea from my favorite cafe, etc.).  Lockdown has made these rituals/practices much harder.  I'm home all the time, with dogs barking, and street noise, and my partner to distract me.  (She needs noise to focus and often has tv or a podcast on when she's doing administrative tasks.)  Plus, the anxieties that have come from covid lockdown make it pretty hard to stay motivated.  I definitely have some weeks where I'm very productive and other ones where I can't even tell where the time goes.  

Just be kind to yourself.  Medication will undoubtedly help, but so will returning to normalcy.  Our culture's obsession with productivity and self-improvement during this whole pandemic has made me mildly enraged, actually.

"9362","Graduating was an extremely stressful thing for me, because it took me awhile (and by awhile I mean a year or two) to believe that I had REALLY done it, that it wasn't all some huge mistake. I had this anxious fear that I was going to get a call one day telling me there was some mistake in my file, I had actually forgotten to turn some paper in or finish some requirement, and that I actually hadn't graduated. When I got home from the ceremony and my parents left, I just sat on my bed and stared at my diploma and just thought, ""I wonder how long until they figure out I took this?""

Most of this was due to my own stupidity and forgetfulness during college, so I had received certain special permissions and waivers and gracious bending of rules to allow me to graduate. I broke down in ugly sobs in a shopping center parking lot 3 weeks before graduation because I had just been informed that I had taken the wrong standardized test, and you had to take the test to graduate. I got an allowance overriding it, because you didn't have to pass the test, just take it, so Student Services pulled some strings and argued that I had taken the old version, and that I would take the right one again as soon as it was offered, but I should be allowed to walk. So the problem was solved but the anxiety took forever to go away. 

So, to answer your question, no graduation was not a happy achievement for me, it was just one more nagging feeling that I probably forgot to do something that lasted 2 years. ","ce4ekv5",4,1387336138,"2013-12-18 03:08:58"

The internet (and video games) are like crack because you get a steady stream of rapid dopamine hits (the reward) as you find novelty after novelty. When the rewards come less frequently, like when doing something more productive, the pull gets too strong.

You can try and focus it and learn something helpful, especially with one of the gamified learning sites. You can try and limit it by being away from it or locking it down when you're meant to be doing something better. The other thing that works for me is learning something new, as to start progress is quick, so new hobbies or skills. It's harder keeping interest of course!

When you look at most neuro-typical people checking phone every 5, and many now appearing gently ADHD, it doesn't seem a habit many can break. Even without allowing for dopamine deficiencies!","d9380m1",2,1477157414,"2016-10-22 17:30:14"

I am slightly slower than my colleagues at lab work particularly when I am first learning. As you do it more you be come more comfortable and quicker. It's not going to happen overnight and will probs not be noticeable to yourself but make sure you take a step back and see how far you have come.

Sticky notes and my lab notes book are my best friend and I have put sticky notes all around the lab and office. This helps when someone gives me a task or changes something on me. Also as you become more comfortable in the lab these things will throw you less.

I am inattentive and tend to think about things a lot. It may look to someone else as being slow brained but it enables me to have a better understanding behind what I am doing and how each step effects the end result. I received some feedback from a few colleagues about this and how they appreciated my understanding of the work I was doing. This also helps to make you more comfortable as you know or can hypothesize how this will effect the end result and how you can fix it.

"9445","Yes. This is hard and sometimes extremely hard.

My brain is usually miles ahead of the conversation that does not roll fast enough or I'm stuck at still thinking something that was mentioned couple topics ago.

This results in being out of sync in a conversation and most noticeably speaking when it is not my turn. Sometimes because I'm too eager to say what I want to. Other times because I'm not able to tell when it would be appropriate. Predicting when the conversation is about to deepen or veer off to another topic is hard.

_I have been trying_ to develop a habit of jotting down thoughts during a conversation or making some marks for the thoughts that arise from that conversation (can be anything: pieces of paper, small drawn characters, lined up raisins).

They help me in two ways:

- not being afraid that I forget something that I thought was really relevant and thus burst out prematurely &amp;rarr; can wait my turn a bit better
- being able to formulate my thoughts better and not losing the point after I utter the first-word &amp;rarr; dare to wait because not being afraid of forgetting and being more to the point 
- being able to concentrate more on what others say as I process my thoughts nonverbally

This tactic is not clearly useful in very casual conversations…

_In addition to that,_ I try to remember to reflect the body language of people who participate in the conversation. (General posture, hands, feet, arms, legs, etc.) This can help me to get a feeling that I can participate in other ways that speaking what is on my mind just then. I can also relate to others better and have patience listening.","eyqji6e",1,1567345150,"2019-09-01 13:39:10"

"9452","Okay, my husband was in the same boat.  They tried to stick him with the depression diagnosis, but that did absolutely zero for the real problem: his focus and memory and all that.

I can only tell you what we did, and hope you get something out of it.

First, I found THE BEST psych clinic in our city.  I called for an appointment ASAP.  I made sure they were equipped to handle adult ADHD by researching the fuck out of the doctors there.  We ended up seeing someone who wasn't a specialist in ADHD, but she was competent enough to be able to diagnose and prescribe meds for it.

Then get a GP referral for the appointment you've already made if necessary.  If not, no worries.

Prepare your case.  As fucking annoying as it is, sometimes you have to go to the doctor armed with a case to be heard.  Explain that you are aware of things like ""comorbidity,"" which is where people with ADHD also often have general anxiety, depression or something else.  Often those other problems mask ADHD and won't go away without treatment for ADHD as well.  And then OVERWHELM them with all the truthful ways you line up with an ADHD diagnosis.  Make it clear that these things negatively impact on your life.

If possible, have a partner or close family member go in with you.  They are often able to report from an outsider's perspective what you do, and keep you from downplaying your symptoms (which my husband most certainly does).  Or, if there is someone in your life who functions as your memory, as I did for my husband, bring them instead.  Needing someone else in that capacity is a pretty clear flag for adult ADHD and certainly made our psych sit up and take notice.

I know this is hard.  You shouldn't have to fight so hard to get the treatment you need.  But this is a fight worth fighting.  You can do it.","cgxiypj",6,1398024626,"2014-04-20 20:10:26"

Done that with ""Sandstorm"" by Darude as well, but not as much as that remix.

To the OP's original statement: I absolutely love techno/edm/dubstep. Blaring it does help me concentrate, but blaring just about any music at max volume (that way it drowns out all the other thoughts) will help me concentrate. But I just really actually love the sound of the techno stuff, I think the beats are fantastic, and it always seems to put me in a good mood, too. It's weird. Definitely my favorite genre though. It's a win-win-win for me because I get to listen to something I genuinely enjoy, it helps me concentrate, AND it puts me in a good mood.

"9461","Well, I was depressed for a year and a half, so I know I'm not now. But it's similar I guess. It wouldn't be wrong to say ADHD makes me a bit depressed sometimes, though it's not the soul crushing black void of chronic depression, more an acute variant.

I often go to play games during these episodes, and find that it usually makes things worse unfortunately. When I was in my teens, before I was diagnosed, I was gaming a lot. It was my refuge. Nowadays it just makes me more depressed because of how unproductive it is. It's still fun, but I just get anxiety from the sheer uselessness of it all, I know I should be doing something else so I can't really enjoy it. The only time I can allow myself to play games is if I'm in a good mood and already have been productive, otherwise I just can't take it.
 Also, games often involve failure and when I'm at my worst it sends me down a nasty spiral. I fail at something in the game, but I want to succeed so I try again. But each failure is a blow to my already dwindling supply of energy and it just hollows me out. Even if I succeed after a while, it doesn't feel like a success because of how depleted my dopamine reserves or whatever are, and then I'm just spent.

Book are nice though! I can't fail in a book, and I'm so happy I don't have issues reading like so many other with adhd.

Oh yeah, food is great! I used to have problems with this, but it kind of sorts itself out with a 9-5 job and a kid at home, with the routines and all. Though if I'm alone for a few days I forget to eat too. Eating a hearty meal then is such an awesome thing.","cyqhfer",4,1452251540,"2016-01-08 11:12:20"
"9462","If you get your thyroid levels checked before getting assessed for ADHD or depression and they are in normal range, I don't see how they couldn't take your symptoms seriously. If they did, I'd be questioning their competency and just go to a different psychiatrist. 

Normal thyroid levels + ADHD and depressive symptoms = ADHD and depression diagnoses (unless caused by another unknown medical condition)

Abnormal thyroid levels + ADHD and depression symptoms = secondary ADHD and depression (treat abnormal levels and symptoms should go away)

Before I went to see a psychiatrist for my symptoms, I got my thyroid hormones checked (I'm treated for hypothyroid).

"9463","48M, just diagnosed a few months ago.

When I was young \(under 12\), I was definitely hyperactive.  As I got older, I became an inattentive type and the hyper symptoms largely disappeared.  On rare occasions, when I felt really comfortable with a situation, I could get hyper and loud.  

My understanding is that this is common in adults, and while it may be perceived as ""growing out of it"", the executive function problems \(planning, following through, motivation, focus, etc\) remain.

In my case, I think it managed to completely mask my ADHD from everyone, including me.  It wasn't until a few years ago that I really seriously began to suspect I had it.  Like Snoedog said, it completely explained everything.  ","dzm670e",7,1527352435,"2018-05-26 16:33:55"

"9473","It’s totally fine to go off meds if you want.  Here’s what i have to share 40 years in. The shortest path is to run experiments. 

A week as a camp counselor on meds vs off is a perfect example of an experiment you can run. Compare A vs B. What do you care about? Test against those criteria and talk to someone about it at the beginning and end of the week. How was the ‘summer journey’ of your campers  impacted?  When were you a better LordofLaugh for them? Did you connect more with your peers better on or off meds? Did you actually have sleep issues?  That kind of stuff.  Were you still funny? Did you enjoy different parts of the job on or off meds?  From there you can make a decision based on data. 

I did not say anything in my comment about hyperactivity. I personally am not hyperactive. I would put most of what I shared in the inattentive pile.  I sleep way better on meds vs off.  But If I take the meds too early in the day, I’m up all night.  You’ll find your own combination to your own lock over time. 

Trying to stay objective is annoying sometimes, to be honest. Especially for ADHD brains. And take breaks from improving my ownership of ADHD.  But when you find a new fact, its empowering and you want more.   Many people do not ever get on top of their ADHD, which is too bad. ","ei1ildw",1,1552011479,"2019-03-08 02:17:59"

Music is a great way for me to fasten this process, because if I pick the right song, I can almost always make myself cry. Writing down what bothers me also helps sometimes. 

If the thing on repeat is an unhelpful negative thought about myself or my behavior, it helps to just accept that I had the thought and not to engage it. I'll say to myself ""Okay, that's a thought that I just had"" and stop myself from thinking further about it. If I repeat this every time I have the thought, eventually it will bother me less and less, until I don't even have the thought anymore. I think this is basically what mindfulness is actually. There is a difference between thoughts that automatically pop up in my mind, and thoughts that I actively think myself.

Other treatments (with the exception of behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapies) are often not considered 'empirically validated' because they have not been studied enough to provide a large sample size across multiple studies.

That, and other treatments are expensive and time-intensive. For those diagnosing and for parents a pill seems like a perfect answer--but they aren't thinking long-term and they're definitely not thinking about it's psychological effects beyond 'fixing the problem'.

"9529","Do not try to force him to do something he does not want to do, instead explore it from the bottom up and let him do it at his own pace, while making him comfortable.

While at the same time asking questions like this.

&gt;I want to go enjoy the nice weather, we can practice driving in an empty parking lot, are you up for this?

This is a situation where you changed the nature of the question but also changed the thought process of the brain.  You see this alot in CBT with depression and anxiety but also with sales if you have a talented salesman who knows how to make you feel comfortable and at home like you are family. 

If you asked do you want to go out practicing driving.  The answer will be no for he is afraid or finds it boring.   You instead telling him that an action is going to be performed, and then ask if he is up to it asks three questions but he starts answering the questions in a different order inside the brain and this makes him less stressed and more open to trying new things.  (Aspergers / Autism often have very deep interests and hobbies but do not try new things out of those interest or hobbies for it seems so overwhelming and they do not know where to start)

* Statement: First you tell him (not a question) that I am going to change my environment, I am going outside, where it is sunny

* Statement: You express to your son that you are fine right now but you could be better by going outside and enjoying the weather.  Aka this is like a shiney carrot in front of his face.  You are telling him you love him, his company, and you want to do something new and novel that is safe.

* Question #1  Do you feel safe right now?  Right now in the house are you stressed or not.

* Question #2 Do you like this plan?  You mention calming words like empty parking lot.  You also mentioned it was conditional for you used can.

* Question #3 Do you like this plan and want to do it?

 * Now this is why sales people can be good, for whenever your brain problem solves it uses various neural networks and some regions solve certain types of problems, but to perform an action you need to use the entire executive system to answer the who, the what, the when, the where, the why, the how, the context, and the intensity of change performed by you, and the intensity of the stimulus.

 * Your brain is hardwired that when you answer one of those 5ws and such to try to answer the other ones automatically.  It is like a math homework assignment that was just the first 10 questions  of Chapter 03, but you enjoyed it so much you do the first 10 questions of Chapter 04, 05, etc to the very end.

 * Now the human brain with these unspoken questions rarely uses the brakes but when it uses the brakes it does so hard.  By asking a leading question while at the same time the other person trusts you and is not stressed it is much more likely to get him to agree.  His brain is not trying to think of excuses, but excuses are also worries and obessions where his anxiety is out of control.  Worry is a different type of anxiety than fear.  Fear is an anxiety connected to sensory perception, Worry is an anxiety connected to **attention**, and you can't worry if you are doing something else that is cognitively demanding enough that you actually have to use your brain for conscious attention can't multitask.","cu8c9wv",1,1439998733,"2015-08-19 15:38:53"

I turned that thought process into a world processing view - I create a baseline ""theory"" of where things are, how things interact and change. I then scan this background noise for any changes, and then zoom in on the big change to extrapolate why the change happened and trace, and test the variables. 

Yes I'm not super accurate to formulas, but I can link and extrapolate data, and learn new data super fast. I can sort and relate data into the framework I already have.

"9540","Keep at it. These kind of drugs are very mechanism specific, and it will take time for you to find what dosage is enough. When it comes to stimulates, less is more. Think about it as a bell curve. Once you cross over the maxima of the curve the effects will only depreciate as you stimulate your brain. The idea is to create a dopamine rich, prefrontal cortex without bringing in too many other systems. 

I would suggest taking your medication with a protein and calcium rich meal. These will help absorbtion be more efficient. I take calcium supplements with my various medications as a possible example. 

Tolerance is your bodies survival instinct. As therapeutic as the medication may be, the body sees it as a chemical that shouldn't be there. In order to combat the excess stimulation, more dopamine receptors will be formed, thus reuptaking more dopamine. Since your body is unaccustomed to such amounts of dopamine it's no surprise it's trying to fight it. People who want to combat drug tolerance usually take magnesium supplements.

"9589","Omg YES!! This is so me. I never cease to be amazed by how much faster time moves than I think it does. Like... exponentially faster. What I perceive as five minutes is usually more like 20-45 minutes. 

This makes it all but impossible to get to places on time or plan and follow through on a productive work day. 

For example, I wake up and get ready for work, knowing that I have about an hour until I have to leave. I do something small like get dressed or wash my face and then I look at the clock and it’s like the time has jumped half an hour forward. So I try to rush and get ready in what feels like 15 minutes to me. But then I look at the clock, and it has jumped forward AGAIN- this time, 45 minutes forward. Boom- I’m already late for work despite my best efforts. 

Or at work, I’ll be working on an email that feels like it took me 7 minutes. But then I look up at the clock and all of a sudden it’s the end of the workday because it’s actually been 30 minutes, and I didn’t get to the rest of the stuff I wanted to get done. 

It’s so bad that even after having gone to the same job with the same schedule every day for the past year, I still CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME properly estimate how long each part of my morning routine will take in a way that will allow me to get out of the house on time. The ONLY way I can get out of the house and to work on time is to aim to leave 30 minutes earlier than the time I actually need to leave. So if I need to leave at 6:30 in the morning, I wholeheartedly aim for 6:00 am, knowing that I will end up leaving at 6:30. 

It’s an endless source of frustration, especially when I get told I need to manage my time better. The whole idea of time management ASSUMES that the person has an intact sense of time. But when the clock jumps forward half an hour each time you look back up at it, what are you supposed to do then????","gjwqm28",1,1611114825,"2021-01-20 03:53:45"

In between the 2 appointments with the psychiatrist, he had a conference call with my psychologist and had me go for a bunch of medical tests before he would prescribe.

I have also heard of psychiatrists who will prescribe based on a 15 min office visit.  Even my medcheck appointments are 30min.   So as with anything your millage may vary.

"9621","I haven't experimented with HIIT in particular yet, but I would bet it can be very effective for ADHD based on the fact that cardio in general is so helpful.

From what I understand, daily cardio (30-45 min) is recommended for ADHD people because it helps increase blood flow to the frontal lobe of the brain - and that area (particularly the prefrontal cortex or PFC) is where our problems with executive function seem to lie. Getting blood flow gets our symptoms decreased. HIIT will definitely cover this aspect at least. 

I believe, HIIT is supposed to train the body for faster stress recovery, and since stress can directly affect ADHD in a big way, I'd speculate that training your body to recover faster from stress may decrease the effects of stress on the brain.

Definitely let us know if you experiment with it! Would love to hear the results.

Also regarding the medication part, it can take a while before you find the right medication so don't be discouraged if the first medication you try doesn't work out. I myself am on month 2 ?i think? of trying meds and have still not found the right dosage or medicine.

"9627","You really sound like me when I was younger. I was fat all my childhood, then started losing weight at 12 years old by restricting immensely, once I learned about calories I started eating 1300 maximum, then lowered it to 800 (for reference, I'm a guy, and  I was around 5'4 and 87lbs/39.5kgs at my lowest). A bit after my 13th birthday I kinda realized all that restricting served no purpose (I watched the movie ""Fat Head"" which is a documentary about basically how a lot of what the media preaches on ""healthy eating"" is BS, especially the notion that fat and saturated fat are bad for you when they actually aren't) so that played a role, to me it seems like I was sick and tired of anorexia and watching that movie was the spark necessary to overcome it. I never made a decision to stop restricting though, it just came naturally. However, I lost control over my food intake. I started binging close to every day, often until my stomach really hurt (went up to 4000 calories in a day a few times, often purged after eating so much). 


Nowadays (currently unmedicated though I'll be back on meds in a few days normally) I ""try"" to eat healthy but don't have the best self control. Oh and if I have junk food in the house, there's no way I will control myself and not eat it all today.

I am now 17 and my anorexia hasn't completely gone away, I still sometimes feel very angry after eating unhealthy and have made myself throw up a few times in the last year cause of it, despite the fact that I'm quite lean (somewhere around 13% bodyfat) and muscular (workout like 3 times a week on average). 

I highly recommend you seek help for your disordered eating, as it's very hard to overcome it yourself. Best of luck.","dmpt3ua",2,1504842702,"2017-09-08 03:51:42"

"9645","I have worked on both the production side and the engineering side of a few factories (automotive). 

On the assembly line, the cycle time from part to part was like 50s. So ultimately there was only so much you had to do, not many steps you could forget, and once I got up to speed I could go on autopilot and let my mind wander as much as I wanted. But that will vary from process to process. 

Now what let me get away with letting my mind wander, is some of the processes had ""poke-yokes"" build into them. Which is a Japanese term that sorta means ""idiot proof"". It is a way to eliminate errors, by making it harder or, ideally, impossible to do something or assemble a part the wrong way. 

Now, some of what you are building may have systems build in that you haven't noticed yet (the holes on a left hand leg don't line up with the holes on the right side, or what have you). Unfortunately you probably won't be in a position to develop these systems, but it is something to think about when you are building them, or when you do make mistakes. Think about ""how can I make it impossible to make that mistake again"". If your management is somewhat decent, they should appreciate feedback like that... As an engineer I always loved it when operators actually have thought about how to make themselves more efficient, or their station more ergonomic. Because even if I helped develop the process, they know it much better than I do. 

Anyways. The most practical advice I can give you. Is count your screws. 
If you assemble part A to part B and put in 6 screws, after you put in the 6th one, look and point at each one and count them to yourself. 
The most important part is the pointing. When you point to the screw your eyes will  naturally follow. Even if you are mentally 1000 miles away, if your brain is expecting to see the silver head of a screw and it doesn't, it'll snap you right out of it. It sounds dumb, and might look dumb sometimes, but I can personally attest that it works.

&gt;

&gt;___Mary Celeste___ was a British [merchant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_vessel) [brigantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigantine). The ship is famous for having been discovered on 5 December 1872 in the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean), unmanned and apparently abandoned (the one lifeboat was missing, along with its crew of eight and two passengers), although the weather was fine and her crew were experienced and capable seamen. In fictional accounts related to the ship, she is referred to as ___Marie Celeste___, first by Sir [Arthur Conan Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle) and later, by others.

&gt;When found [derelict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derelict_(maritime\)), *Mary Celeste* was in seaworthy condition and still under sail, heading toward the [Strait of Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar). She had been at sea for a month and had more than six months' worth of food and water on board. Her cargo was virtually untouched and the crew's personal belongings including valuables were still in place. None of those on board were ever seen or heard from again and their disappearance often is cited as the greatest [maritime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping) mystery of all time. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;The question of why the crew left *Mary Celeste* has been the subject of much speculation. Hypotheses include the effects of [alcohol fumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol), [underwater earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_earthquake), [waterspouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterspout), or human actions ([piracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy), [mutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutiny), or errors of judgment).

"9663","**Main points bolded, the rest is support/elaboration:** This may not apply to you, but for what it is worth, most of the time, I didn't feel like I had a Ferrari brain. For the sake of discussion, some reasons I think this can happen (to me, to you, to someone else).

1. **It is so time-limited, in my experience.** Especially if you have the widely fluctuating hormones that go with having only ovaries (I can't speak to the complexities of anything else) -- estrogen levels impact your symptoms. Around your period (especially right before) you probably feel more spacey and forgetful; I understand this is also true post-menopause, assuming no hormone treatment. However, the two weeks after, you'll probably start feeling better and better (zoomier and zoomier) up to around 2 weeks, when you start over with a dip, then a crash into your next menstruation. Rinse, repeat. (This is what I took away -- for more, please look at someone who has both the time and detailed knowledge to give you solid details!)
2. **The outcomes are of such mixed value.** It is important to claim our unique gifts, partly *because* we still experience so much stigma. That said, we also need to balance this with understanding our unique struggles -- and different people take different paths, and risk going overboard in different ways (overstating gifts, overstating flaws, overstating statements). I think it is true that just like our ADHD flaws are extensions of normal human flaws, our ADHD gifts are extensions of normal human talents. I might have more ideas sometimes, but not necessarily better. Sometimes it is several reddit comments. Sometimes it is several pages in the first notebook I found in the moment, detailing a monologue that could be titled ""ExplicitInformant: An autobiography on why I'm *not* being melodramatic or whiny when I say that everyone thinks I am a poopsicle, because honestly, people really do think that, without exception -- well except for people who didn't open the metaphorically opaque wrapper of my social persona -- and maybe I am really a poopsicle or worse, a poopdog or poopburger or poo-ding, and what if that pun is the pinnacle of my ability to act on my creativity.... oh whyyy gods whyyyyyy""
3. **Crippling social anxiety (or depression, or both).** When I bottled it all inside starting sometime before puberty, it became this kind of vague, muffled background of existence that was nondescript. It was something I never shared with others. I am not going to get distracted looking up the science, but I think there is some science to support that children learn to form autobiographical memories through conversations with adults (e.g., the cheesy, ""And do you remember what we did yesterday?! :D"" kind). My experience was that because I learned not to share me with others, it took me a while to learn how to notice and remember myself moment to moment. It was like going through teenage identity crises in my 20s instead of teens. 
4. **Even knowing who I am, my memory feels like a bystander at the race, or the driver who remembers ""fast, and quick turns, and near misses!"" instead of the details of ""Hosting City, Fantasticland, specifically the Quaintly Memorable Suburbs north of 9th street.""** My memory usually doesn't capture everything there is to what I think when I am in the relatively rarer zoomy Ferrari moods. My energy and enthusiasm for tracking it waxes and wanes, and my review of it is unreliable, meaning altogether, I think waaaay more than I remember. I only know that now -- and to the extent that I do -- because I've been trying to consolidate my notes made over the years. I am between tensely amused-because-there's-no-other-option and deeply pained by all of the writing I don't remember but that I resonate with, that I think I could have done something with if I'd seen them at the right time --- except I am the one who *wrote* them... Or, alternatively, writing that exposes a side of myself I didn't know about that strikes me differently after years -- like to the tune of ""Oh, this person is so wrong, how could they even think that-- oh yeah, right, again, this is my writing. Wow, this really puts a different spin on my autobiography... although it does support the poo-themed substance of my soul. D:"" 

**Most (more than 3/4ths) of my ideas are slight variations on a misdirected theme.** I would say the vast majority (like 78%, as someone who likes to be conservative with percentages) of what I ended up writing in my first 27+ years of life was ""zooming"" on the same exact theme, with only details changed -- *""Life is bad right now but I can't give up because I don't want to yet. So okay, I have to take action. So I am going to. But reasonable action this time. So by reasonable I mean [details], philosophically speaking. And here is some more philosophy. Now that I am juiced up, here are my* very specific goals and action steps *and some preemptive (poorly timed) trouble-shooting that I have not determined is necessary yet. And here are the places I will take each of these goals, and now here they are elaborated in this new goal-management philosophy I just read about. That is all for now. See you again next week when I tell you about how I did none of it and I am a poopsicle.""* One of my current lasting projects is creating a kind of weird anthology of all the applied or self-created attempts at project management and self-motivation that I tried... :|

**Hopeful takeaway:** Part of posting this is that this is what I wote -- and if I double-guess it too much, I'll get to where I'll never contribute to anything again. I hope it adds something. Partly, I hope it helps destigmatize the iadvertant stigmatization of lacking these hyperactive elements, that can sometimes be the byproduct of trying to destigmatize hyperactivity/impulsivity/whatever this is. Especially as I think hyperactivity might be mandatory for diagnosis in Europe (?), and is still more often noticed in the US than inattention, and so would more often be the target of destigmatization attempts. And to make the point that women with traditional ovarian hormone cycles can have a weird relationship to hyperactivity and inattention in general.","d982emm",2,1477454119,"2016-10-26 03:55:19"

Now. That said - having had them - and gotten them from ADHD meds (thanks bunches Dexedrine!) they are very discomfiting and icky and horrible and I am so so sorry that you're experiencing this.

\-Drinking lots of fluids - especially making sure to replenish electrolytes. Hydrolyte and the like are your friend here.

Nobody said it was a get out of jail free card. Some may use it that way, but nobody promotes or excuses that behaviour.

Being unable to organise tasks, for example, isn’t “adhd” when life gets on top of of you for a month and you’re a bit depressed..... it’s being happy/content/okay... while knowing you have 3 assignments due in two days that you haven’t started, doing them all the night before, Getting two in late, if at all, and doing this on repeat your whole life. It’s debilitating.

Chest pain is a symptom of a heart attack - but just because you have chest pain doesn’t mean you’re having a heart attack. You need to see a doctor/specialist who can confirm you’re actually having a heart attack. 

There are literal studies that show an adhd brain is generally different to a “normal” brain.

"9722","This question is awful close to home -- counteracting time dilation is certainly one of my most enigmatic personal obstacles. I wish I had a proper answer for you, forcing yourself to adopt a complicated scheduling and alarm system is likely to be counter-intuitive or just will go completely unused (at least, in my own personal experience).

The key is in making things as simple as possible. While I don't have a proper answer for you, I can share something sort of similar...

Getting out of bed quickly and early in the morning is hard for me, I will too often lay in my bed for hours semi-conscious. Not really sleeping, just too lazy to get up. I've learned that the trick to getting up is this -- jumping out of bed is not going to happen. If you try to fling yourself out of bed in the morning, chances are you're going to fail most of the time.

So I wiggle one finger, which is always easy enough to do without fail. Then another, then all of them, then my hands, and my arms and shoulder and so on. The process takes only a few seconds and is likely a lot more comfortable than trying to catapult myself out of my sheets at 6AM.

The problem, if I may posit, is not so much the absolute, objective duration of the task, but rather the procrastination and avoidant behavior resultant of overestimating the difficulty, length and impossibility of the task -- and in doing so, one perpetuates a self-fulfilling prophecy, and needlessly paralyzes oneself with the percieved immensity of the task ahead.","caedt4e",20,1370645476,"2013-06-07 22:51:16"

If you feel like 10mg once a day sustains you through your productive waking hours, that's great.  But it sounds like both the prescribed dosage and the associated number of daily doses might be inadequate to give you much help with your symptoms.

If 10mg gives you no ill side effects and your doctor has never had you titrate, you may want to ask them to have you attempt to slowly increase the dosage until you find it working better for you.

"9729","Mine is more like a solid wall of mediocrity. I cant never get past the below average/basic level of anything it feels like and its embarrassing to even mention how much time I've put into anything because it seems like it was all wasted time. 

I dont have a comfort zone or adequacy at anything, so I am pretty much always learning things as a beginner or lower intermediate at best--even if I have logged a substantial amount of time in reality.

I think that may set me up for being more willing to try different things where other people might be more focused with pushing their hobbies and strengths

In terms of making close friends--I'd say the oversharing can get some interesting conversations but I am pretty unideal as an option. It takes a lot of energy to focus on being a respectable conversational partner and I am exhausting to listen when I can't seem to be clear or concise. I am somewhat annoying and kind of awkward to be around for many people as well and I don't offer anything to people that they can't get with a lot less effort from other people.

"9747","""Hyperfocus"" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD.

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

"9750","I dont't struggle now, but I used to because of a lack of clear boundaries and an unclear sense of my own strengths. The partners I would pick were absolutely terrible matches for me, and the only things we tended to have in common were sexual things - because they were exciting. What helped me was thinking hard about what *sort* of person would be ideal based on my personality including ADHD - independent, patient, good listener, open to exploring new things. I've been with someone like that for five years this month, though it took some time.

I think the ADHD part of your story is impulsivity. In addition, it seems like you don't really know what consistently excites you in another person - but that is part and parcel of being in your 20s. You're not expected to know all of that yet, and it usually takes quite a bit of exploring to find out. Try not being so hard on yourself about that.

If people consistently say you act immaturely, *listen to them*, and ask why, then take that criticism (it's not easy!) and work on the things that have been said consistently. Listening and reflecting and working on these things is the single biggest non-pharmaceutical thing you can do to improve here, in my opinion.","d1r2q1n",5,1459883642,"2016-04-05 19:14:02"

* Relief - Now I know why I'm flighty and forgetful.  Why all those little mistakes and missed details seemed to constantly derail my life.  Why something as simple as a handshake involves anxiety while I over-analyze grip strength, eye contact length, and whether I'm holding on too long.

* Anger - why did nobody notice?  Aside from decent grades, I'm pretty obviously textbook ADD.  

* Something approaching pride - I got where I was despite all of it.  I developed coping skills that (mostly) worked for me.

Things will always be a bit more difficult for you than for some others.  The good news is that you know why, and that there are ways to fix it or, at the very least, help.

"9764","I think that around this time, reading became associated with needing to memorize/learn what was on the page, which means my brain checks out because I probably don't want to do that. Over time, my brain started associating reading with stress and struggle, so it tries to distract me constantly while I'm reading, in an attempt to keep me from experiencing that pain. 

Once I was in college, it took hours to read my textbooks every day, so I couldn't have leisure reading time even if I wanted to (and by the end of the day, I didn't even want to *look* at a book). In that way, reading became exclusively a chore and a source of stress. I hadn't read a book for fun in years, up until this past semester. 

I realized all of the above, and on a weekend when I had less to read than usual, I went to the library and picked up a book I had genuine interest in and was dying to read (*The Autistic Brain* by Temple Grandin...I'm a neuroscience nerd). My brain only fought me for the first half of chapter 1, and then I finished the whole thing in a few days. Reading my textbooks was actually EASIER after that!

Generally I play it off like it isnt a big deal, because it isn't. Theres an anti-adhd feel to society that needs to be phased out. Acting as if your medication/adhd is just another part of life (instead of a huge part of life) is one way of getting rid of that stigma.

If this is for school, try to identify any campus resources that could help (virtual or on physical campus.) These might not just be ADHD specific. If you can find an audiobook version, that can help a lot. I often paired audiobook with the hardcopy and would switch between the two. If you're reading an ebook or PDF you can often find free Accessibility software / screen reader apps to turn it into audio.

It also helps to break down long readings. Are the 450 pages equally important? (If its nonfiction, probably not.) If it's fiction, I found it helpful to look up a short summary of the plot and then actually read for details. I felt less stressed that I was missing something basic because i had a vague sense of the plot. I could take time to read the chapters and zoom in on what I suspected was going to be important parts / details. Active reading strategies are crucial for us ADHD brains. I also tried reward myself for making it through a chapter. Try to write down key points / short summary after every chapter, too! This is an annoying but important active reading approach. You can just skim your own notes before class to refresh your memory.

Be compassionate with yourself. Take breaks, please. (Time them if you need to.) Even neurotypical brains are having concentration issues right now.

"9809","So honestly, I had no idea about adhd and then I took an online test cos a friend sent to me.

Then I read up about it online, and here and realised I should talk to a doctor about it.

But, for me the worst tings were Procrastination, distraction and executive dysfunction. It got to the point in work where I had to ask people to send me bullet pointed lists of what they wanted and where to start. If people asked me to do something on a call, I would immediately forget about it as the call ended. 

I think lockdown has done a number of things to adhd folks as it's constantly boring/stressful which are big adhd triggers. For me things were getting worse and worse. 

This is the online test I took - it is not a diagnostic tool, i am sharing it as it helped me to understand which of my behaviours related to adhd, and helped me to research it before speaking to my doctor. You will need to speak to a doctor for a diagnosis. - https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/adhd-quiz

I'll also say, that Borderline Personality Disorder has a lot of overlap - a lot of adhd people might score highly for this - but there are key differences. But it may also be worth looking into to if you're unsure of what's going on with you.

If you can't see/afford a doctor - the highest yield positive activities for me that helped over the years are Regular high intensity exercise (every other day), and a very strict sleep schedule. Bed time and wake time that doesn't flex or change.","gnj2o84",1,1613392988,"2021-02-15 12:43:08"

"9816","Kinda just blame seeking here. SSRI side effect profile is very mild, considered an extremely low risk drug. It is a first line treatment for so many psychiatric disorders, you wouldn't even know if you never needed it without first taking it anyway. If you were manic, that's another issue entirely, as they would indicate possible bipolar which is a contraindication. 

Adderall on the other hand has a pretty brutal side effect profile, commonly including anxiety. I speak not just from medical experience, but from my own time being prescribed to Adderall for years.

Do whatever makes you feel best at the end of the day, but I would be exceedingly cautious with taking Adderall daily without at least some break periods.

Further, Klonopin is a benzo and is rarely used as a long term treatment. My guess is that it is only temporary to get you through your current situation.

If you really feel like you were manic on SSRI's you need to tell that to your doctor, as you may want to try mood stabilizers. You may not even have ADHD at all, but rather inattention was caused from bipolar. It's tough to tell with psychiatric illness, as there is a great deal of overlap/comorbidity.

"9817","First of all, I always write down things profs say about what will be on tests.  Even little things, like,""if this were a test question,  I wouldn't care about x because of time constraints but I might ask about y."" It helps with knowing what to focus on later. My in class notes are pretty bad, but I look over them almost solely for things like ""this table will be given on test,  don't memorize"" &amp; ""ignore sections 3.5-3.7"" and it seems to give me a leg up.

Right before a test, I read/outline my textbook. It's slow but it's the reason I kill curves in all my classes. After I'm done outlining, I think about the major concepts I'll need to know and make sure I can really articulate them, and connect them. (This sometimes means skimming outside sources.) If I gave the tiniest uncertainty I look it up.

After this, I do practice/old tests if available, and see how well I'd do. Go over wrong answers and things I realized I was still uncomfortable with.

Last, I skim PowerPoints and class notes. I often carry these and my chapter outlines with me on test day to keep things fresh; I also continually mentally self test.

A few times as I doze off, I'll wake up because I'm just not breathing. It's pretty annoying, actually. 

I read [a theory stating that it has to do with](http://www.mynaturesrite.com/sleep-apnea.php) the mechanism in the brain that shuts down muscle activity to prevent you from acting out your dreams. Sometimes the brain shuts down too much, like breathing. Apnea can cause daily fatigue, mental fog, irritability, etc..

I have daily fatigue, pain, lethargy, mental fog.. it's infuriating. 

The interesting thing is, when I was about 10 years old, I used to have a *lot* of energy... running, jumping, climbing. Here's the kicker: I also used to sleepwalk. 

So I wonder if the mechanism in my brain used to be underactive, and fail to shut my muscles down during sleep, causing me to sleepwalk, but also allow me to breathe enough. And now that same mechanism is overactive. I no longer sleepwalk, and seem to fail to breathe enough.

It has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research. It is not listed in either of the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. This means that Dodson, his explanation of these experiences, and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism. 

Although this sub's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven theories), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and this post has therefore **not** been removed.

"9845","So I am still at it some ~2 weeks in , I have to say that it contributes really well at me doing stuff. I can't say that's the only change I made in my life but I do believe it helps that I cut out my biggest dopamine input (video games). I can say that I didn't cut totally but like the biggest chunk of it, for example I was capable to play like 10h a day of one specific video game , since I stopped playing that particular video game I off course have more time to do more things , I can play random games from times to times as long as I can see that I don't get addicted to it I will only play between 10mn and an hour , and that's OK. If I see that I get to much into it I put the game on my black list.

I also started watching a lot less movies , I changed my way of living , eating differently , learning about good food habits , my only source of dopamine I d say is watching a lot of YouTube video on the things that excites me, not like cats but more things about add/ADHD , bio hacking, bulletproof diet and things like that . 

But the thing that is helping me the most is definitely learning how to make lists! 

I self diagnosed some 20 days ago , and cutting dopamine sources from my life is in the top 3 things that helps the most (2 other are lists and changing life habits) .

I think I have to say that I don't have meds and I don't think I ever will cause I live in France. I have a appointment with a specialist in about 2 month and half. Also I don't have a job, and I barely didn't get out of my flat for the last 9 month , and slowly restarting .

The best thing that ever happened to me was finding out. As every body I wish I found out earlier (soon 33 yo).

Cheers and thanks for the advice !

* My advice is to write down all your ideas in a brainstorm fashion and then pick from within them while you scan them with your eyes, and use the pencil to cross off bad ideas.

Why this will help?

* Your mind is not good at keeping lots of stuff in your working memory.  It is a smaller jar than other people's brains.  Thus shuffling things around in your mind is harder for your brain to do and sometimes you may forget an idea and/or it is harder to to expand those ideas into all the possible scenarios for if you expand to far you may forget things.  Your brain gets this at an instinctual level.

Thus by putting everything on paper you do not need as strong of a working memory.  You are now using your sensory and motor parts of your brain **to help with the task**.  4 heads working together as a team often work better than 2 heads if the 2 heads had problems.  Thus your brain does not need to spend as much mental energy trying to remember everything and more mental energy on the actual solving of the problem.","ckt6rvr",0,1411747826,"2014-09-26 16:10:26"

"9862","I was on Adderall for over 10 years and I felt the exact same way that you're describing. I had surgery on both feet and had to be on narcotic pain killers for a little over a year and shortly afterwards I had a PTSD like event happen to me psychologically and had to be put on anti-depressants and benzos for all the many panic attacks I was having the first few years afterwards. Because of those two things (being on pain killers for the first time in my life and then weaning myself off of them as well as being put on the other two medications), the Adderall that I'd been on for over half my life no longer worked. My doctor worked with me to try a few different types of stimulants until I'd found Vyvanse. For some reason my body metabolizes the instant release stimulants too quickly now. So stimulants that are extended release such as Vyvanse work really well for me as they release throughout the day. But I know exactly what you mean when you say that your medication makes you feel like doing those small things that you want/need to get done without the dread that you otherwise feel. It took my work (I work in a \*very\* noisy office processing medical documents electronically) nearly two years to figure out that I was not faking when I told them that I really DO have ADD. That when I disclosed it to the company/HR, that I was not just trying to get attention or anything. I have to work with active noise cancelling headphones AND ear plugs in when I was having to come in and commute everyday. But now luckily my work has started a new work from home program where they provide the computer and chair you just have to have internet and have met certain quality standards to be able to work from home.

So the next night, you can do it. But it’s hard. Every choice to focus is harder. It wears you down and running up a hill is hard work. You won’t always have the power or will to do it. Instead you’ll hate yourself as being lazy, etc.

I am no doctor, but I love medicine.  Sometimes I can give you some pointers on what to look out for with that med (side effects you need to monitor for) but I am not a subsitute for a doctor and I can not tell  you what will be the best med for you.

Finding the best ADHD med for you is trial and error.  There are 6 or 7 mainstream type of ADHD meds but most people do best with the stimulants or strattera (3 of those 7).  Same thing with anti anxiety meds many different types of meds but usually there is a larger cluster where most people do best with these types of meds.

Unfortunately you can't figure out which med is best for you until you try it.  You do not know if you are in the bigger cluster or the smaller cluster until you try the med.

"9889","Hi there, having dealt with the same issues myself, I have found that focusing on constant training / practice in being compassionate and mindful really helps. It's easier said than done, but with time it gets easier. 


Before speaking (1) I pause and ask myself: Is what I am going to say or ask *of objective value or worth*? (2) What is the goal point of my comment in simple terms; and (3) How can I get to that point in linear steps? This really helps me decide whether or not participating in class discussion is worthwhile when I often get too excited and want to volunteer *all* the time! It helps me focus on being more selective with my words.


Per listening, every time someone is speaking I have to remind myself that (3) People don't just spit out words for no apparent reason. Obviously what they are saying is important to *them.* And they are *sharing* a gift of thought in the form of spoken word. If I reject their gift by not listening, it hurts. Not to say that *everything* everyone says is worth to listen to, but just because you listen, doesn't mean you have to accept what they are saying. 


On the ""they are talking too slow"" comment. I try to put myself in their shoes. I wonder how awful it must be for them to hear me rambling too quickly! I also try to imagine people I am talking to are people are those I care about and love. It sounds kind of silly, but fostering compassion for someone really helps with being more patient. I wouldn't tell someone with a speech impediment or native language issue *Get to the point already!* or *Hurry up!* so why should I do so for other people?

"9892","I should add that no facility will likely have all positive reviews and there will be some angry ones. When people aren’t ready to do the work involved in healing, psych wards are difficult and painful places to be, since you are put in a position where you are facing your own inner monsters when you don’t want to. 

From my experience, being ready doesn’t feel like being ready. Being ready was being tired of what I was dealing with every day and being willing to “show up” and try. A lot of it felt like failing at the time (anger, hurt, fear, disbelief, rage, offense, regret), but as I faced all those emotions, in time I realized that a major part of my problem before was that I was in a mental position where it hadn’t been safe for me to feel those things. It never feels mentally or emotionally safe, it is always a “risk”, but it’s worth taking. And psych wards enable you to be in a place where you know you will be physically safe while you are grappling with your emotional safety nets, unknotting unhealthy ones and building better ones.

Consistency does help me a lot but I've been getting up early for over 15 years now between school and work and it hasn't helped me be any less tired or more productive in the morning, whereas any day that I get to sleep past 8:30 or so I have infinitely more energy regardless of what time I went to bed. I know a lot of people with ADHD have delayed sleep phase disorder, which is something I'm interested in looking into for myself since it seems my natural sleep cycle pretty consistently runs between about 11pm-8-9am.

In my case it's almost entirely opposite of yours, where the earlier I have to get up the more time I end up wasting first thing in the morning because I'm just that much more tired and sluggish, even if I went to bed early and fell asleep right away.","gw2su3k",1,1619546681,"2021-04-27 18:04:41"

It does get better as you get older -my symptoms have declined somewhat with age - and I mostly conquered the things that devil you right now. 

I hope it's OK to share what's helped me - it required a lot of patience, and spending the lucid time I had creating a physical structure for my life where *one thing* goes in *one place alone*, putting that one thing back *immediately* whenever I was done with it, and making that a habit until my unconscious 'lizard brain' just goes there when my frontal lobes fail me. 

So, for one example, my drawer for cycling clothing - I have a bunch of plastic bins from Ikea. All my gloves go in one bin. All my arm and leg warmers in another. All my hats, ear muffs, and neck buffs go in another. They ONLY go there. Whenever I am done with a ride, I go through every pocket in my jersey and backpack, and put everything back before I do anything else. My headphones go on ONE shelf next to my bed, next to where I recharge my phone. I then hang the backpack on the ONE hook it gets hanged on. And so on.

It's almost physically painful at first, but as it becomes an unconscious habit it does get a lot easier. And always knowing where that one thing is going to be removes a lot of paranoia and fear. 

I think of it like we have a 'tax' on our brain that others don't have. Over-compensation of habit and external structure are our only salvation.

"9902","There's no scientifically correct water consumption.
With our without meds.

Required water for your body to stay healthy varies depending on many things like temperature, food you've eaten (some food may dehydrate you), and various toxins you consume like alcohol, cigarettes, vegetables and processed food.

Personally I drink 0.5L in the morning when I take meds. And then up to 1L spread through the day, and 2L during hot days and exercise.

If I start experiencing headaches I immediately drink 0.5L

I'll also add that I drink a lot of coffee and milk.","fp19jbk",1,1588228360,"2020-04-30 06:32:40"

Medication helps you regulate your focus, not in that you automatically focus better but that your mind is clearer and your better able to know when your off focus and redirect yourself. 

If that makes sense! I've only been on medication for a month and a bit now, 30mg Vyvanse, so it's still possible my dose is too low or it's not the right medication for me. 

Having tried Concerta up to the highest dose and feeling 0 difference (not even increased energy, or stimulation...I litterally felt the same at all levels) and Strattera which gave me panic attacks, I can say that finding the RIGHT medication is life changing. 

I finally feel the cloud being lifted and have the mental energy to try techniques for regulating my executive functions :) It's not perfect, requires hard work, but I am able to start those habits and maintain them unlike before.","drl8lrk",1,1513892588,"2017-12-21 21:43:08"

I'm curious, because I have one of the most rare types for women, and I find that I get along with people of my same personality type the best.

"9934","Take a free [Vipassana course](http://www.dhamma.org/). The catch is that you have to sign up for ten days if you are a beginner, and everybody has to take a vow of silence until the last day. There is a short session at the end of the course where they ask for donations, but aside from that, they don't solicit at all and I haven't gotten one call or letter asking for money.

They feed you two meals a day and give you a bed. I had my own room, but I think it depends on the camp. It is completely secular and not affiliated with any religion. 

You can sign up for a five minute session during lunch where you can ask the teacher questions, but aside from that, no talking. The teacher convinced me to start sitting crosslegged (I had been using a chair). I didn't think I could do it, it was so painful, but by the end of the course my legs adapted. 

They want you to do ten days because they believe that is the amount of time necessary to teach the technique to where the student actually has an experience that demonstrates it's value. Around day 8 or 9 I had an ecstatic experience.

"9939","(Sorry this ended up super long!)

I was diagnosed and started medication at 9 years old, so I don't remember a lot of details (I am now a few weeks away from 20). What I do remember is being frustrated a lot. I remember my mother making me sit down at the kitchen table and telling me I *had* to do my homework. As soon as she left I put my head down on the table and started kicking my legs and day dreaming. And she came back later and yelled at me for not working and I got so frustrated because it was like I *couldn't* work on it. It felt like there was a physical wall in my head that kept me from being able to concentrate on it. I remember that she started sitting with me at the table and every time my attention started wandering she would pull me back to the work. And this would go on late into the night. I remember being so frustrated because she kept pulling me back but I physically *couldn't* do it, I couldn't concentrate. I remember crying a lot during those sessions. I remember mom getting frustrated and yelling and giving up. But in class it wasn't so bad. (I know now that that's because I was doing homework after class, when my adhd batteries were fully drained and we didn't know how to refill them, but in class my batteries were full). In class I really didn't realize anything was wrong until someone scolded me. I read a lot. I started hiding the book under my desk because the teacher kept getting angry with me. I talked all the time to the people at my table. I thought they were my friends and it devastated me when my teacher pulled me aside and told me that she had been getting complaints from my table mates about how annoying I was. Apparently I literally never shut up and I was always talking to them when they were trying to work. They also complained about me constantly moving and fidgeting. But I didn't realize anything was wrong with my brain. I was just so *bored* in classes, all the time. The work was boring and I would rather read, so I did. And the homework was hard and I would rather play, so I did. I got in trouble all the time. It kicked in at age 7, and I was convinced my 3rd grade teacher hated me. I couldn't understand why she was always angry with me and punishing me. I thought the same of my 4th grade teacher. She was so frustrated with me that she got nasty, and that just confirmed to me that she was just a mean old lady. I didn't understand why all the other students liked such a mean teacher. I didn't understand that it was me who had the problem, I just thought the work was hard and boring and the teacher was mean. At times I felt stupid, because all the other kids were getting their work done. They didn't think it was as hard as I did. All my previous classes had been easy, so I thought either the work was hard or I was stupid. It was confusing. I didn't know that my ADHD had developed and that was why everything was hard.

And then I got the diagnosis. A family friend recognized the symptoms and told my mom to get me tested. So she did, and I got medicated. And it was incredible. Things weren't hard anymore! Things weren't boring anymore! My teacher was nice to me! My friends were nice to me! I didn't read anymore. I waited until recesses or break or after I had finished my work. I didn't get in trouble. I started making more friends. I joined a group of girls and sang in front of the classroom. The song was about *how much we loved our teacher!* Just weeks ago I thought of her as a devil woman! And then I realized that the problem had been with me all along. I cried then. It hurt realizing that and it took a few years to adjust to the idea. But god, school was great now! I blew through my work. I had tons of extra time because I got everything done so fast. I rarely had to take home homework because I would get it all done at school. Things weren't so good at home, but school was amazing! It was like being in Antarctica for years and then someone moves you to Tahiti! Things weren't perfect, and I still have to work at it, but I can only imagine what my life would be like if I was never diagnosed. I probably would have abandoned school entirely.","d9eb75e",3,1477856451,"2016-10-30 19:40:51"

You were dealt a shitty hand, and you've grown from it by being more creative. The only thing the ADHD is responsible for is making certain tasks more difficult, though. It's just the disorder. The growth that you've experienced because of that difficulty is something to be proud of, and it's in no way shaped by your ADHD. That's all you, and it's not a lie. It's probably the realest part of who you are, since it's the part that grew out of hardship.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at 25. Like you lean leaned towards creativity because of your ADHD, I leaned towards developing my communication and critical thinking skills. In my classes, to compensate for not having completed my homework, or not having studied, or whatever, I developed stronger rhetorical skills and the ability to think more critically than other students. It was a way to get passable grades*in spite* of my ADHD. I used these skills as crutches to compensate for a lack of subject material knowledge. 

In my first job, my boss said my ability to talk through everyone's ideas on a team made me the best natural leader he'd ever seen. It was one of the most rewarding compliments I've ever received. He would come to me with managerial problems, because he felt my skills lent themselves towards solving those problems in ways he couldn't.

I now take Ritalin and work with a therapist to keep help my life organized, and I'm going back to college after dropping out several years ago. But I still have those skills. I'm still a great critical thinker, I still have a knack for being able to communicate in a way that makes people feel appreciated and motivates them towards our goals. That's all me, not the ADHD. But now I have an opportunity to develop the skills that previously held me back, too. I can round myself out.

You're creative when you zone out. You'll still be creative. That's not going anywhere. But now, you can have a little more control over when it's time to zone out and when it's time to work. The skill is all you, and that's not going anywhere. It's just the blocker that's getting removed.","dcncvgz",1,1484866647,"2017-01-19 22:57:27"

I’ve found the only way to avoid the clean, folded laundry sitting untouched in the basket for a week is to put it away immediately after folding it. But I really hate doing laundry, and I always complain about it 😅

Until you find a new serious girlfriend, it will be hard to stop comparing girls to your old one bc she is your main frame of reference.  You are very clearly better off without her - she didn’t respect you or how much you cared about her, but it’s normal to have trouble getting her out of your head.  I’ve been with my SO for over 6 years now but even though I hated my ex after we broke up and my SO is nothing like him, I still compared them some for the first few years and even now still sometimes think about my ex out of habit.  I could not be less interested in being with him but thinking about the same person for so long is a hard habit to break.  The best thing I did for myself was 1. Try to improve myself for my own sake, not to get him back (even though, like you, I did want him back at first) AND most important 2. Not let myself think about him voluntarily.  Whenever he came to mind I would immediately force myself to think of something else.  It sounds stupid, but it really helped change my mindset.  He still came up in my head, but less, and it kept me from romanticizing him.  Now I just remember the shitty parts and how I’m glad we broke up lol.

Keep working on yourself and pushing through - it sounds cliche, but this really all will seem so distant someday.  Also, if you can take some possibly mean comments along with some good advice (and maybe you can’t, which is fair!), r/relationships might have some good moving on advice.  If you don’t want to post, maybe search for old posts?  There’s some crazy stuff on there but people really do try to help people with relationship issues too.

"9999","First of all, do you need your phone, tablet, or computer to do your project? If the answer is ""no"" to any one of those, then turn off that device and put it in a different room.

If you need your phone and/or tablet, put those devices on ""do not disturb."" In other words, disable anything and everything you can app wise and txt msg wise, but allow emergency contacts to call you if they need to speak with you. Then put your phone nearby, but not within arm's reach. The idea is you don't want to use it for distractions, but you also want to be able to hear it in case you get an emergency call from a family member.

Next, is your computer the biggest distraction? Start using timed website blockers. You can tell Firefox and Chrome to ban you from visiting a website for X many hours.

Also, don't be afraid to hold a study session with other classmates to keep you motivated and to allow you to build up a momentum. You don't have to physically invite them over (because of the plague), but you CAN ask if they want to do Zoom, Google Meet, or whatever they use.
