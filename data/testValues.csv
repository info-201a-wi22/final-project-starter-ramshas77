"5","It really pisses me off how easily doctors hand out these SSRI scripts and depressions diagnoses üôÑ

Find another doctor! Don't give up- your doctor is uneducated and misinformed about the actually reality of adult ADHD and the study upon study that have been done on this exactly.

I'm 32, wasn't diagnosed until I was 29/ almost 30.
My psychiatrist did the exact same thing to me..said if my school and teachers didn't call my parents as a child bc I was misbehaving in class then it wasnt ADHD. Didn't test me, ask me anything except that one question. I had just recently read a bunch of studies for women as undiagnosed adults particularly and knew he was wrong.

He also wrote me off as your has and gave me a script for Wellbutrin. Which is funny bc one of the side effects for this medication is weight loss- especially at that time I was already ""underweight"" according to some height and weight charts and while I thought my weight was fine I know losing much more would dedinitely put me under a healthy weight for my mere 5‚Äô2 height. Plus, I was not depressed.

I was very lucky to have an in-law at the time who was seeing a GP family doctor who specializes in Adult ADHD. And he is hands down the most caring and wonderful doctor I have EVER had. He‚Äôs not only informed but actually interested in the complexities of ADHD and the comorbities that follow. It was like night and day.

I told my doctor and she told me to try taking 1 per night instead of 2, but I completely forgot over the past month to take them at all, so I only started taking them again after I failed my comps and literally stayed awake for hours thinking about it over and over.
It was recommended that I start therapy, but I was worried it would cut too much into my study time, and I figured if I could get my ADHD under control my anxiety wouldn't be so bad, so it was low on the priority list. Now I'm realizing my anxiety is a bigger barrier than I originally thought, and I scheduled an initial appointment at the student counseling services.
As for the study buddies, that's complicated. The other grad student who does what I do is much older, and we don't totally get along, and I don't trust him because one time I asked him a question about something that I was thinking about doing in my research, and my advisor emailed me later that day asking why I was asking about it, so I feel like he's tattling on me and I'm not comfortable with that. I don't really have close friendships with any of the other grad students either. When I failed my comps, some of them asked about it, but when i told them they were just like ""Oh...."" and no one offered consolation or to go out with me to cheer me up, etc. So after that I kinda just gave up on trying to be friends with any of them, they don't seem to care about me.","ea6paa8",1,1542829764,"2018-11-21 19:49:24"

Strattera is tricky. Even after a dose rise you need to give it like 8 weeks. Smart prescribers tend to rocket the dose up to the adult standard pretty early, based on side effect tolerability. But if you have some other issue needing addressing you'll probably want to avoid it and its complexities for now anyway.

What side effects have you experienced on stimulants, and at what doses? Maybe a pattern can be discerned.

"44","Hi, sorry for replying to the same comment twice, but I just wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate this. I think my psychologist has been trying to explain basically what you just said, but for some reason seeing it here has helped make it click for me. 

I think I‚Äôve never realized just how many negative thoughts I have. I think I‚Äôve always associated ‚Äúanxious thoughts‚Äù with things like ‚Äúoh no how am I going to pay the bills‚Äù and the like. More ‚Äúcomplete sentences‚Äù of anxiety, if that makes sense.

Considering what you‚Äôre saying about conditioning and CBT, however, I‚Äôm realizing that I have anxious thoughts all the time‚Äîthey‚Äôre just not as obvious. I‚Äôm always reacting to my physical sensations, I‚Äôm always freaked out that something I feel will get worse or will always come back, I‚Äôm always telling myself horrible things about what‚Äôs next or what‚Äôs currently happening... and I‚Äôve never really tried to change the thought part of that. 

I‚Äôve always been so focused in the physical. I‚Äôd feel tired or would ‚Äúcrash,‚Äù and I‚Äôd get upset over it and wonder what‚Äôs wrong with my body/energy. I‚Äôd ignore the fact that I was just thinking about how much longer I have to work and attaching misery to those hours (even though I was fine beforehand), and instead focus on how miserable and tired I now felt. I‚Äôd get tense in my shoulders and get upset, obsessing over things like posture and exercise, without realizing that I was already focused on my internal before the stiffness happened. 

I guess I kind of assumed that if physical things were happening, then they took priority, and I can more or less ignore the mental side of things. Which is probably the opposite of what I should have been doing, honestly. But it‚Äôs really hard to tell yourself ‚Äúthink better!‚Äù when you‚Äôre experiencing pain/discomfort. I always used to say that I have a poor brain-body connection.

I think one of the reasons it‚Äôs been hard for my psychologist to get through to me is because she asks me stuff like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your narrative?‚Äù and I never know what to say, because I never feel like I‚Äôm making scenarios in my head. I just ‚Äúfeel crappy.‚Äù But now I‚Äôm realizing that my ‚Äúfeeling crappy‚Äù is more than just that, and that abstract or unclear sensations/thoughts still count as narrative too. Telling myself ‚ÄúI feel like crap‚Äù is a narrative. Trying to decipher every physical sensation is thought. 

Another reason is that she‚Äôs prescribing things like controlled breathing and meditation, but those also don‚Äôt really help when I‚Äôm so focused on the internal. Arguably, they make me even more internal‚Äîand since I don‚Äôt realize what I‚Äôm doing, this makes me think even more about how ‚Äúeverything sucks‚Äù or ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs wrong‚Äù or etc. Breathing to relax my shoulders is just as useless as exercises to relax my shoulders‚Äîthat is, if my brain is going ‚ÄúYOUR SHOULDERS ARE TENSE AND IT SUCKS‚Äù the whole time. 

Christ this reply is getting long. Point is, I think you hit the nail on the head. Even applying your tips for self-talk this morning has been fascinating‚Äîit makes me realize just how much my brain tries to go back to anxious thought. Telling myself ‚ÄúI am currently eating, and the food is good, yum,‚Äù results in my brain trying to drag me back to ‚ÄúWHAT ABOUT YOUR BODY THOUGH? WHAT DO YOU FEEL?‚Äù Witnessing that pull is really educating and revealing.

I‚Äôve also noticed that, as soon as I focus more on self-talk instead of letting my brain run wild, I get more traditional anxiety symptoms: tight chest, a little nervous, heart beating. Which sounds bad, but I actually think that‚Äôs good too. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm pulling the sheet off the anxiety, revealing it, not letting it manifest in things like tension and lethargy. I‚Äôd much rather have conscious anxiety than unconscious, and I think the self talk is helping me detect that more. I used to have this happen when I first tried meditation‚ÄîI‚Äôd stop feeling tired, but would feel my heart and chest. And I liked that better then, too, but I didn‚Äôt know why it happened. 

**TL;DR: Thank you for taking the time to write up this comment. It‚Äôs helped me already, and it‚Äôs given me something to talk about with my psychologist. I really appreciate it.**

EDIT: Now I just have to see if I even have ADHD anymore, considering I was so painfully unaware of just how anxious I am. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with ADHD by 2-3 doctors, but who knows. I didn‚Äôt know about any of the above, so maybe I misread the ADHD symptoms too.

As far as stimulants, well, I find that my ""enthusiasm"" tends to stay more ""regular"" while medicated, although it does decrease my stress tolerance, meaning when I am in stress scenarios such as in academics, my anxiety heightens much more than if not on medication. One reason I got off of it, as well as a feeling of further altering my perceptions, and not wanting to be dependent on a pill the rest of my life. ","dy2smcx",1,1524857252,"2018-04-27 19:27:32"

"59","I think you make a reasonable argument for the point you are trying to convey but I disagree still, and I believe it comes down to a fundamental disagreement in what it means to have a disorder or disability, and one's mindset about it. 

You see, I don't think people have all the choices that people give themselves credit for. Some things just aren't a choice. 

Do you really believe that it's laziness that caused you to sit and discuss whatever it was with roommates instead of going to do the laundry? I don't.

I believe this because I know that ADHD is an impairment of the executive functioning of the brain. And on a very simple level, you didn't do the laundry because at that time, given the circumstances, you were incapable of doing so. 

Think about it. 

Laundry is a pain. It's not immediately rewarding. We can talk about laundry and how it sucks. We can also talk about laundry in a different way and say ""Hey it can be fun right!?"" but our brains instinctively know better. 

Our brains know there is no immediate reward in doing laundry. Before even considering it, our brains know where the immediate reward is. It's right there in front of us, it's bs'ing with our friends and that back and forth and deep conversation and jokes that are making us feel good. *Right here right now*. 

If laundry even comes into our train of thoughts during that activity, it will immediately be shoo'd away because no no no look here we're having a good time. 

If laundry happens to *stay* in our train of thought IE: ""I really should put this on hold and go do the laundry"" then that's where the fun begins. That's where we hit a brick wall and no matter how much our brain screams at us ""DO THIS DO THIS PLEASE JUST DO THE LAUNDRY"", the stimulus will not let us go.

So you can say that it's laziness and that's fine if that's what you believe. But just be warned that an attitude of ""I can beat ADHD if I just try hard enough"" is futile, and ends in a vicious circle. I speak from experience because I am living that as we speak. 

edit: To have unmedicated ADHD is to constantly swim upstream. Just because the current can get too strong doesn't make me lazy. ","cj3tt3h",3,1405979838,"2014-07-21 21:57:18"

When you go in for an adult ADHD assessment it helps if you can bring a person who has known you since you were a child (like a parent) and can vouch that you had symptoms when you were a child. Having this person come with you just gives you more authority and will make the Dr feel more confident about making the diagnosis. 

You have to present with x amount of symptoms and these have to have been present during childhood, or something like that.  You're a med student read the DSM. It helps if you can show a bunch of negative stuff you can attribute to the ADHD like poor grades, struggling in employment, relationships etc. Depression as a result of never been able to achieve or follow through with anything.

I had similar concerns before my assessment but the Dr was really good. They looked at my history and diagnosed me within 30 minutes. They didn't for a minute question whether I was faking it. In my experience most doctors want to help. I almost cried when they treated me sympathetically. Don't feel guilty or afraid. If worst comes to worst you can always get a second opinion.

But yeah: bring a support person to vouch for you, read up before you go and link the DSM symptoms to real shit in your life. 

I hope this helps good luck.

"88","I have Inattentive ADHD and depression and had been with a type A person for 7 years!

We were both each other's first serious relationship and met in freshman year of college. I am someone who cannot take a hint to save my life, so I spent the first few dates (that I didn't know were dates) as really fun friend hangouts lol.  When we started seriously dating, I think the biggest hurdle for us was my emotional irregulation/ rejection sensitivity, he used to remark that I have a cry scheduled every other week, that was also before I was diagnosed mentally, and it really put a strain on us when he was also going through a rough time in school in year 3. It wasn't until we had a lot of time to communicate about how I process emotion differently, and both learn to deescalate the emotional tension when things get sad.

I have learned to take my blunders less seriously (not like not owning up to it but like, not profusely apologizing and crying), like I was MORTIFIED the first time I forgot that I already told him the same fun trivia multiple times that day, like it still happens occasionally but we can laugh about it now. I overtime realized that my self-doubt that I freak out over about is probably the one thing that makes him the most upset because there's not a whole lot he could do about it.

I think the most valuable thing this relationship taught me is to value myself so much more than someone with mental illnesses. It took me years to realize that instead of someone with difficulties, I'm someone who overcomes difficulties. I didn't think I was someone with a terribly low self esteem but he's like Mmm no, you deserve to feel even better about yourself. And that's really great haha.

We live together now, looking back now it was such a long emotional journey that I'm so glad we stuck around for. We are still negotiating on how much mess I'm allowed to keep, but at least now I'm have my arm length radius around my desk to be piled under paper stacks. I think there will always be differences between him and I, but I feel so much more comfortable now that we worked out a solution for every one of them!

Good luck! I hope you guys have so many more fun dates ahead of you, you can do it! She asked you out she's really into you already.","fwby75a",1,1593400278,"2020-06-29 03:11:18"

If your therapists are good at all you shouldn't have to say much before they pick up on the problem. If they aren't then if you can, get out of group therapy and get someone who can focus their attention on YOUR issues! You don't want to get fed up, it never helps, but you need to let the actual professionals know that this is causing problems for you, and they need to be receptive to that. Be very polite but very insistent about the fact that this person is causing problems for your therapy.

I was hard on myself as well, especially with how my behavior impacted others.  It's just something you have to learn.  Even people who do not have ADHD have aspects of their personality that they are not comfortable with, and learn to deal with them through interacting with other people.  This will be a good experience for him.","c2pqr45",1,1318033649,"2011-10-08 00:27:29"

To me, the curse is really that we KNOW what we're doing won't help.  We KNOW we should be doing something else.  We KNOW that if we just [insert activity here], we would be so successful.  Yet we still can't.  

Now diagnosed and with a prescription for a medication that really does help me, I still struggle.  What's CRAZY is that the thing I struggle with the most is actually taking my medicine.  I've adjusted my morning routine SEVERAL times, but I've found that if I don't eat before medicine, I probably won't eat all day.  I've been on this stuff for 2 months and lost 10 pounds (I was already a healthy weight - I'm getting close to underweight now, but probably could lose 10 more pounds before it was actually dangerous).  Thing is, I pick up breakfast at work - they have a big cafeteria with good, cheap food.  And it's convenient.  So then I get to my desk and start eating and working.  And then forget to take my medicine.  And then remember and STILL don't take it... :/  The inertia is too much.  Overcoming and breaking out is so taxing, and it seems crazy.  I'm yelling at myself to do something, but I'm not doing it...  I WANT to.  I know all the benefits I get from my meds.

For me, feeling bad and kicking myself about what I can't do just ensures the task will be impossible. But if I am confident (or pretend to be) that I will do it, in fact I am absolutely certain, then it becomes a lot easier. It's like trying to hold sand in your hands - the harder you try to squeeze your hands and hold it, the more falls out. 
It also helps to remember that I do like the subject I'm studying, and that my ability to sit in one place/perform on standardized tests is not related to how much I like it! This makes me not worry about studying the ""right"" way, and I read/study for enjoyment. This is a longer term strategy as you do of course have to tune it to yourself, but even in the short term just remembering and refusing to feel bad about my quirks, even if they're causing me trouble, frees me from a massive energy-sucking mental burden.

I also had these side effects when I was on a lower dose, but I don't think I noticed them, as I was off my fluoxetine at the time and I was feeling more anxious. I'm also concerned that it might be unrelated to my medication. 

I think the headaches might be a dehydration thing. I don't drink enough water in the day. I'll start drinking more. Today, I'm feeling really headachey, foggy and woozy, but I think it is because I had almost double the amount of sleep that I usually have and my body isn't reacting well to it. I'll monitor my symptoms throughout the week and see if anything changes. 

The sensitivity thing isn't a huge issue for me. I always make sure I carry ear plugs and such. The only time it becomes a problem is when I am in the car with my mum. She vapes and the smell of her liquid is incredibly overwhelming, but she won't stop doing it.

When im taking reading comp tests (or english tests in general) ill completely missread words and confuse the whole text (luckily underlining things and rewriting them helps me kinda work thru the misreads) generally with reading every 7-8 paragraphs ill have to reread in order to fix my comprehension of it. Thats probably 3-4 when im reading for school. And then when im reading online or from my phone (or like one of those portable readers) its usually every other paragraph. 

I sucked in latin because i would CONSTANTLY loose my place on a passage and get words confused and endings switched places on words.

It uses special paper that enables the pen to record your writing and store it digitally so you can upload it to the computer, but thats not why I am telling you about it. It also records lectures. Then you can click a word on the paper, and it will play back what the teacher was saying when you wrote it. So if I missed the definition of something, but happened to write the word down, I can go back and listen to what it was. SUPER helpful for me. They also taught me how to take the audio file off of the pen, and use a speech to text software so I also have the lecture in the form of readable notes.

"179","I have the same problem. Here are some suggestions that may work.

* Try meditation. You can find short guided meditations on YouTube. Here are some: [One](https://youtu.be/hzsV6ZwZvlQ), [two](https://youtu.be/OoM57Z8dRUY), [three](https://youtu.be/7wFX9Wn70eM). [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/) is a good app for meditation, too; [Xhalr](http://www.xhalr.com/) is a website for controlling your breathing.
* Writing in a diary sometimes helps. For both the meditation and the diary, I recommend using an app to help you remember. Someone else just recommended the [List:Daily Checklist app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dancingdroid.dailysuccess&amp;hl=en), and it's helped me a lot.
* I run almost every day. It's what keeps me sane. If you are on medication, make sure you consult a doctor regarding an exercise schedule. Also, if you don't have time for exercise, walking 10 minutes a day, three times a day (morning, noon, evening), is also beneficial.
* Make a list of things you enjoy. When your mind starts going down the rabbit hole, say to yourself, ""STOP."" (I have to add that medication has tremendously helped with my ability to do this, when I remember!) Then direct your attention elsewhere to something you enjoy.
* In addition to the above point, I really recommend going outside. A lot of times I find that my mind becomes squirrely when I'm in my house (or other place) for too long. Going outside once every hour, or getting up and walking around, helps this. 
* Do you have pets? Getting up and paying attention to your pets is also a stress reliever.

Obviously this isn't a comprehensive list. I'm currently reading a book about [CBT techniques.](https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Behavioural-Therapy-Dummies-Branch/dp/0470665416/) The wiki [also has some CBT suggestions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/search?q=cbt%2C+flair%3A%27tt%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)

The first two just shorten how long the medication lasts while **grapefruit can cause toxic buildup of his medicine which is very very bad.** Potatoes, no matter how cooked will mess with the length of the meds. Ensure your son has luke orange juice or pineapple juice he can drink in case of either a drop in blood sugar or the meds getting all out of whack. If this happens I‚Äôd recommend just going home, he probably won‚Äôt be able to focus if either of those things happen, he‚Äôll probably feel just absolutely terrible and panicky and nervous in one such case.

"207","ADHD may both be in the normal range of variation and also be 'real'.

Let's use an analogy.

I had poor eye sight. It started when I was about 12. I couldn't see the white board in unless I sat in the front of my classroom. I could read, I had no problems eating or dressing myself. I could do school work. I just couldn't see more than about 15 ft away.

There's nothing pathological about my eyes. They were never damaged. I never had a pathogen that harmed them.  It was genetic. My parents are near sighted too.

So I got glasses.  This glasses made it possible for me to do things like learn to drive, navigate busy cities, do well in school. Getting the glasses cleared up the headaches I was getting from trying to squint to see.

You could imagine a woman in a hunter gatherer society being near sighted and it mattering not at all. My responsibilities would be caring for children and preparing food, tending garden plots. You could say my symptoms were only a problem because I live in a modern society.

But the modern society didn't cause my near sightedness. That existed independently of the social world around me.

ADHD is a constellation of persisting, severe symptoms. It's defined behaviorally. But if you looked at my cornea, you'd see it was shaped wrong, even though my near sightedness was diagnosed by asking me questions. ADHD brains have differences that can be measured. 

So yes, ADHD is real. Yes you probably have it (although false positives happen). And there's nothing wrong with a medication that allows you to function in the world we actually inhabit. 

Stigma will persist. Heck, people used to call me nerd and four eyes. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø","eztuasw",1,1568138794,"2019-09-10 18:06:34"

You'd need to do something that would make the liver more effective, which I'm not sure can really be done.

And keep in mind that doing the magnesium and tums is a bad idea with Adderall. It can lead to sudden spikes and quicker dropoffs in effectiveness. Basically, it uses the stuff all at once instead of more gradually. I usually take mine with milk, which keeps the gut from being too acidic, but tums will make it more basic than it should be.

"234","I was in the exact same boat. Teenage boy who was suddenly growing like crazy but had never ""learned"" to eat. I also just physically couldn't scarf down food like my cousin could. Like half a loaf of bread for breakfast and such. 

So I got skinny, had problems with blood sugar (ever been in a queue at the store or somewhere else and you felt like you're about to pass out and get all sweaty and have to sit or lie down?) and was just all around miserable. 

My advise would be to check out some health forums and such for people trying to lose weight. And just do the opposite. They advise each other to not have snacks around, so try and buy snacks in bulk and have them always available. Nuts are best of course, doesn't really matter which ones, maybe don't overdo it on the peanuts if you're allergic ;), but everything goes really. And keep them where you will see them and always within reach. Next to your computer, or the TV or next to your school bag so you can throw in a small packet before leaving. 

Eat late. It will probably fuck with your sleeping but this is most likely a problem anyways. And I find it easiest to eat late, maybe with a show running or something. Liquid foods are also a good idea but keep it simple. Nothing gained by making these awesome smoothies once or twice and then forgetting about it because it's too much trouble. Peanut butter is also nice. If you can stomach just eating it out of the jar (I did it with a knife). If your mind is occupied otherwise, you forget how weird and disgusting it is. Drinking full fat milk is also pretty great. A litre is 640 kcal and gives quite a bit of protein whilst also being easy to gulf down. I stopped it because of the poor cows though. 

Of course this is all pretty shitty advise and I should say that you should do sports to get an appetite, only eat healthy foods, cook lavish meals with amaranth and couscous and such, but if you're in a situation like I was, then getting calories into you is much more important than eating healthy. 

Maybe you can get your parents to help. They could even keep an eye on the healthy thing ;)

And if you like cooking just the tiniest bit, you could try and make bento boxes. Like in Japan. Just rice and then whatever vegetables or sausages you want thrown on top and put in a box. Takes a bit of effort to get up and make it but you then have a meal that all done, in a nice little container, ready to eat whenever.","f2ahsug",1,1570113506,"2019-10-03 14:38:26"

The book itself goes in to detail about how different vitamins and hormones in your body interact with the signal receptors in your brain. And also how these interactions affect your ADHD symptoms. There are tips and advice on supplements you can try backed up with peer reviewed sources of information.

"266","For me? I see a school counselor every two weeks. She also has ADHD. Most of the time we just end up chatting about random things instead of school stuff but I always walk out of there feeling inspired to keep going!

Plus there is accommodations for ADHD as it is considered a learning disability (at least in my school) and they can give more time for exams and teach you good time management! 

On top of that, I am taking the least amount of credits I can while still maintaining my full-time student status. 

It was terrifying at the beginning and I almost didn't show up to my first day I was so stressed out, but I'm so glad I did. Teachers in college (at least the good ones) are much more understanding than high school teachers and less strict, in my experience. 

Honestly I love it. There's always new projects to work on and things to learn, I'm rarely bored. 

What helps me out is this: Grades are just a number, very few employers will ever ask for your grades. D's GET DEGREES. Focus on just showing up to class and the rest will follow.

But once it's rolling downhill, aligned with ""gravity"", we hyperfocus and dive into tasks deeper and longer than other people.  

&amp;#x200B;

I remember constant fights with my parents about homework.  My siblings would do it each day when they got home, and sit there until it was done.  That was torture for me, not only would it make me restless and irritable, it was inefficient.  If I could just find the right timing when I'm in the right headspace I'd breeze through it, but ""just sit down and do it!"" would drain my willpower dry in a few minutes.  

Eventually I convinced my parents that doing it in my room was much better than forcing me to sit at the kitchen table like my older brother did, but there were a few times when I'd get behind and they decided to crack down and force me to sit there in silence until I finished.  No matter how many hours they'd keep watch and force me to work, I never caught up...after a couple hours I'd be going at a snails pace while I fought the panic rising in my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

The most valuable skill I've learned is knowing when to apply my willpower.  I suck at looking busy though, even if it's 6pm and a deadline is 16 hours away, it's more effective for me to go home and play video games for 6 hours before coming back than to keep pushing through...my worst nightmare is to work under a micro-managing boss who springs hard deadlines again.  (I literally pushed myself until I couldn't form a single sentence without at least one long pause to recollect my thoughts, ""just push through it"" is shit advice.  I ended up totally unable to do my normal work for 2 days, and I still needed help to cross the finish line)

&amp;#x200B;

Conserve your willpower and use it effectively, don't fight yourself.  Sometimes taking an hour to hang out with friends is the best way to allocate 3 hours you have to finish an assignment.  Go with your flow, you have to shape it to stay on course, but never try to force your way against the current.

This may be something you'd want to talk to your doctor about, to see what suggestions they might have for keeping your pills to yourself, but it's probably mostly going to come down to you having to keep your pills somewhere else or refusing her. The benzos can't be great for her drug abuse issues, either... :/  (and the ritalin could do her trouble with the anxiety, too; it's why I didn't stick with it beyond a few weeks). 

ADHD is quite heritable, so it's not surprising to have many relatives with it. Growing up, my sister and I referred to our youngest sibling as ""the poster child for ADHD"" - and my parents kept mislaying or forgetting the paperwork to get the testing done... Since I wasn't nearly that bad, I never considered I might actually have ADHD until a therapist suggested it. But, honestly, going home is like attending some sort of Distractable Olympics or something

I can see the appeal of having the effects last longer, being in school... Long days where you can't always guarantee that things needing the most attention will come earlier - I time my meds and the timing of my forecasts (they're due at a certain time, but I can get them done whenever before that) together, since it's almost always going to be the same.

As someone who had to try multiple medications before getting to Vyvanse, I totally understand not wanting to fiddle with meds during exams. I basically lost a couple months of work trying stuff that didn't work/had bad side-effects for me. It still isn't totally perfect, but it's amazing how much easier things can be with the meds, and I end up wondering some days how on earth I managed to get so far before lol.

"340","Experiencing emotion more intensely isn't bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder typically don't experience events more intensely than other people--the reason why it is a mood disorder is because mood is generally unaffected by environmental triggers. The reason why mania is terrifying to behold sometimes isn't because of the intensity of the emotion, but rather the fact that it isn't caused by anything external. A manic person can be fired from their job and still be giddy and grandiose. 

Experiencing emotion more intensely than others is a problem of emotional regulation, which is common in mood disorders but also a symptom of BPD and BPD traits.

"354","I'll try to keep this brief. 

I was undiagnosed until the age of 26. Growing up I was always one of the smarted kids in all my classes, yet my grades we're pretty much garbage. I had several teachers who went way out of their way to facilitate me, they took a special interest in me and gave me work or assignments they felt would hold my interest better. I am extremely grateful for these few teachers. Aside from that I had a horrible time trying to keep focus in class. I was distracted by every little thing, I was always disappearing into my own head. Made it through school with average grades, but very high test scores. Not wanting to take out massive loans for college I enlisted in the military. The program I was in during my time in the military started out with two years of school, one year of classroom, and one year of hands on, before being sent out to the fleet. This school was much more fast paced and much more time intensive than high school. Through much pain, agony, and hours struggling to focus I made it though, again with mediocre grades. Same thing happened when I got to my ship. There was a lot to learn about the specific format and I struggled. Here though I slowly learned how I learn, and how I can best attain information. I ended up doing extremely well in my field. After 6 years I left the military and began work in the civilian world as a service engineer, repairing machinery in factories. I loved working with my hands and I loved fixing things, but that was unfortunately only part of my job. I NEEDED to take frequent breaks because I felt like my brain was chained to my work and it drove me insane. I grew very unhappy with the career and decided to quit. After 4 months of unemployment and growing doubt in myself, what I wanted to do, and who I even was anymore. An old friend hooked me up with an interview at a FedEx Office. At the interview I was asked what do I want? I didn't know, I asked her to specify what she meant. She told me ""what do you want to do? what do you want to be? how will you get there?"" I thought for a single second, and the question I've been asking myself for months with no answer came to me. I told her I want to go to college and pursue a career in the field I now work in. Months later she told me she hired me because of my response. I started college the next fall. While at this job one of my coworkers said I reminded him of his son, who has ADHD. He asked if I ever got checked out. I told him the thought never even crossed my mind. I did some reading and watched a lot of videos about ADHD and it was like my whole life started to make sense all of a sudden. I cried a lot the more I learned. I didn't feel bad because there was something ""wrong with me"" but I was just so happy that I really started to understand myself. I saw a number of doctors and was diagnosed at 26 years. I was prescribed medicine. It helps, its by no means a fix to anything, but it does help. A few years later I am still in college, and one of the best students in my department. I'm in a very competitive (3 slots for over 100 applicants) working for one of my ""heroes"" in the field. I still struggle every day with my ADHD, but learning more about how I can handle it, medication, and just knowing and understanding what I'm dealing with helps a lot.

I also always do what I call ""the idiot check"" before leaving a hotel room: check inside the shower/bathtub for left items, then move all dirty towels one at a time into the tub, check every flat surface &amp; drawer in the bathroom, then repeat in the bedroom.  Next, I look under all of the furnishings (especially the bed) &amp; if that's all clear, I strip each layer of bed linen individually to make sure nothing got eaten by the sheets.

While I am not an expert, I can share my own story which will hopefully be helpful. Personally, I wasn't diagnosed until my fourth year of university. My first experience thinking I might have ADD happened on a night when me and a friend were jokingly taking a variety of online quizzes together we found on some subreddit. One of them happened to be one of those online ""ADD initial assessments"" (of which you can find similar ones simply by googling), where I scored off the charts. Initially, we laughed it off and joked about ""how much of a gong show I am"". However, a few days later I stumbled across an [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/adhd-is-different-for-women/381158/) about women and ADHD, talking about different presentations of the condition, and how frequently it went unnoticed due to outdated diagnostic criteria. Digging a little deeper, I started reading more anecdotes and lists of symptoms, each one resonating more than the last. I found story after story of individuals living life, who like myself, were able to succeed in school, work, etc. But hidden beneath that was a chaos that seemed to far exceed that of those around you: extreme procrastination followed by all nighters, a consistently messy room regardless of how hard you try to keep it clean, and overwhelming guilt about the fact that you can't seem to keep your life together in the ways that everyone else does.  *(Disclaimer: I don't want to assume your gender. Regardless of the fact that many of these articles were written about ""women and ADHD"", based on what you've said, the issues raised and the differing diagnostic criteria seem very applicable in this situation).*

Interestingly enough, when I first brought it up with my doctor, she similarly gave me a survey, and then just started asking as my behaviour as a child, what my past grades were like, whether I got in trouble a lot at school, what my current average was, etc. Given that I had always had good grades, gotten along She said based on my responses, it was unlikely, but she would do a follow up if I brought some old report cards in. I felt so ashamed that I **almost** didn't bother going back in - in fact, it wasn't until I was talking to my family one evening and my sister asked ""does our family have any history of ADD? My doctor and I have been talking about it and I seem to have a lot of the symptoms, and they said family history is a big indicator"". At that moment, it was revealed that not only had this been an ongoing concern for both of us, but my father and other sister had ALSO been diagnosed by doctors in the past, but had just chosen never to follow up on it. Armed with this piece of information, I got the courage to go back to my doctor and be a little less passive about it, and be honest about the extent to which I was struggling to maintain my lifestyle. (By this point in university, I had started hitting my breaking point - my procrastination on assignments was getting less and less feasible causing my grades to slip, my room was so messy that I lived in shame about it and could never have people over to my place, and I could never seem to pay attention to class on the days I managed to attend).

&gt;I worry that I'm just trying to blame my laziness on something else, and that I'm blowing a normal thing that everyone deals with out of proportion

This is probably one of the most relatable struggles that I've heard come up around discussions around ADHD. Even after being diagnosed, I still struggle with this. (Honestly, I am still uncomfortable admitting my diagnosis to people, or that I am now on medication, for fear that they won't believe me or think I am somehow ""cheating the system""). But more and more evidence is surfacing that this is the kind of mindset that actually ends up delaying diagnosis. It seems like this same fear of laziness comes from the same place that drives you to put in so many hours of work, or feel so bad about underperforming. 

Following from that, my first piece of advice is **do not be afraid to be your own advocate** - there are countless tales of dismissiveness from professionals, often related to the reasons you've mentioned. The reality of the matter is that not everyone is an expert in the condition, and many still live with narrow or skeptical views of what ADHD encompasses. Depending on your situation, it might be worthwhile to bring it up with your doctor, or seek out specialists for ADHD that might be more qualified than a general therapist to make assessments. Additional, do some googling to see if there are any groups that meet up or organizations related - many communities have centres dedicated to ADHD (or even just learning disabilities in general) that offer different drop in group sessions, or other resources that might be helpful. 

Regardless of whether you choose to continue out seeking a diagnosis, there are some important things to keep in mind. The somewhat depressing truth is that, much like many mental health disorders and learning disabilities, there is still a lot we do not understand from a scientific perspective, and because of that you're likely to encounter some level of inconsistency with how the condition is diagnosed, treated, and even just discussed. 
While I obviously do not know you, I honestly believe that your fears that you are ""lazy"" or ""blowing things out of proportion"" are probably unfounded. The fact of the matter is, you know you brain and how you function better than anyone else, and if you're identifying with these symptoms of ADHD, then you have the potential to embrace this and try and start moving forward. If you eventually reach a point where you might want to consider medication, this of course will require you to seek out professionals. Regardless of your choice on that matter, there are things you can do to start improving your situation. For myself, and many others, one of the most useful things is using this revelation as a stepping stone into changing your mindset. The more I read others stories, strategies, the more I am able to separate myself from this idea that I am ""just lazy"" and start embracing the fact that I just function in fundamentally different ways than the majority of people. For me, it has become about making an effort to actively think about the way that I think and work - since I have started identifying my work habits and really thinking about them, I have been able to start strategizing and trying to create situations that were better suited for me. Rather than floundering trying to do what I thought I ""should be doing"", I've been able to embrace less conventional, but more realistic goals and tactics. (E.g. I know I procrastinate, but I also know I often hyperfocus. I've embraced this by reaching out to friends, and asking them to set up short, 30 minute meetings far in advance of an assignment due date to ""start talking through the assignment"", which often is just enough to rope my brain in. While this still often yields me doing an unhealthy amount of work all at once, at least it's not the night before the assignment is due :P )  Don't get me wrong, I've still got a long way to go - I'm typing this from a room that's horrendously messy while procrastinating other work... but the more I engage with myself and with others on the topics, the more I can both understand and embrace my strengths and weaknesses.

"368","I was in a similar situation.  I was prescribed 25mg XR because my doctor thought it would march my schedule for college and work.  But I didn't enjoy it because I could feel it wearing off and losing effectiveness (not really feeling the second dose kick in at all).  So I chose IR because I can take it whenever I want and not be awake for a long time.  I think you would benefit from IR better.  My advice:

- Take IR about 30min before your morning class (unless you want to get used to the rush and have it settle down so you don't seem cracked out).

- Around noon is where your first dose should wear off. (I find that IR lasts a little bit longer than XR to some extent oddly enough).  You could take the next dose when you feel it wearing off.  Or take it when you get back and take it before homework.  I would take it before I do my homework, but not too late (the latest I was told was 4pm).  I just would do that because sometimes the crash of adderall can be very draining and sucks.  (Drink a lot of water, eat regular meals and snacks).

- One last thing you may want to consider...
XR has a better crash/come down than IR.
But IR is easier to take ""breaks"" on (using 1 dose a day on weekends) so you can tamper off a bit and give your brain a break.  Versus XR where you're getting 2 doses no matter what.

TL;DR

I recommend IR since you can spread out your doses better throughout the day at your own will.  They both have benefits that I find useful and wish could come with both.  But it's all about what your schedule is like and what you prefer","crdl2bt",2,1431998347,"2015-05-19 01:19:07"

Can I try both/all of them? (best final approach possible, IMHO, very results-based)

&gt;What I also mean is ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù, or the boring state of not wanting to really do anything at all... not enjoying many things. and just the blah feeling, or you only ever doing the things that you REALLY enjoy doing, and nothing else is ‚Äúfun‚Äù.

Brain fog and lack of motivation aren't the same. Brain fog is a collection of symptoms such as forgetfulness, a lack of mental clarity, confusion, and an inability to focus.

&gt; (just don‚Äôt say depression). I‚Äôve been like this my whole life, and I couldn‚Äôt have been born depressed! My whole life has been blah like this...

Why do you think you can't be depressed just because you've been this way as long as you can remember? What exactly is stopping a chemical imbalance from occurring since childhood? Chronic low mood is a problem that has nothing to do with age. The fact that you think ""you were born like this, it must be normal"" kind of contradicts itself when you're making a post like this about not feeling the way you think you should. How do can you tell what the world looks like to everyone else if you have never been able to see color before?

It could or could not be from environmental factors in your upbringing or biological factors or both. Forget what you **think** you know and look up what these things actually are.

Depression has a clear definition from a medical standpoint. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007

(Fun fact: Brain fog could be a symptom/sign of depression. Poor nutrition or vitamin deficiencies (like D3/Folate/B vits/Choline/etc) could cause any of these symptoms as well. There are so many things it could be and they could be feeding one another.)

____

And of course these CAN be independent to one issue or another, but it is extremely common that they come along **with** ADHD. Your symptoms could be ADHD + DEPRESSION, Depression + malnutrition, Malnutrition + poor sleep, whatever.

&gt;I hate reading text in general and would just rather watch videos because of videos ‚Äúregister‚Äù for me better. 

Learning style preference, mixed with the fact that videos are inherently more stimulating. I just stopped trying to read and started watching videos or listening to audiobooks because of it. It works better for me so I make due.

Personally, I think you very clearly sound depressed from the what you are saying and how you are saying it. You just might not realize it because you dismissed the possibility with false assumptions of what it is.

You should definitely see a professional to help you deal with whatever is troubling you. Getting ADHD meds, antidepressants, or just a better perspective could seriously do wonders for you.

See your primary doc for bloodwork for health checkup, mention your issues. See a psychologist/psychiatrist for other non-nutrion related diagnosis, and then see a psychiatrist for treatment if they find anything with your mental health that can be dealt with. Psychologist/therapist could always help regardless of any of these.

"402","The symptoms you talk about do indeed seem to be symptoms of withdrawal.  However, you should not have them with Adderall, as Adderall has a half-life of about 9 hours, so by the time you wake up in the morning all of the medicine is out of your system, assuming your last dose was 8 hours before you go to sleep.

You can have a small effect like a headache, but if you are up at night then something very odd is going on. 

Edit: My explanation has people thinking I don't know what half life is, so I am going to clarify. I have a degree in psychology and studied the effects of many medications.  Yes a 10mg dose of adderal taken at 2pm will still have about 2.5 in the morning. The key point here is that the withdrawal you will experience is from 2.5mg to 0mg.  Which is not enough for most people to cause significant withdrawal symptoms. 

So in the end a headache, ya that is acceptable and should not last for more then the day.  Being awake, sweating and sleeplessness are to strong of symptoms. So yes, OP should be concerned there is something bad going on. ","d43sf6c",12,1465575554,"2016-06-10 16:19:14"

With that said as you went in to see a psychiatrist for another issue its more likely you have depression due to your toxic family issues. I also think caffeine withdrawal, and the decrease in drinking and drug taking are taking a toll. You used drugs &amp; booze to cope with both your adhd and underlying issues.

I would wait and see  as long as your not feeling depressed all the time or suicidal. Also are you keeping to your dosing schedule ?  Skipping doses with ritalin makes me feel like shit but skipping an entire day doesn't. I know this is a bit cliche but are you exercising daily ?

http://www.spcollege.edu/sapappeal/

And other tips, keep it to less than one page. More then that and I believe your school can not accept it. Do not write about stuff like, I had trouble in class, I was in the wrong major, and stuff of that type. Only put down the facts of your illness and how you plan to combat it. That is what I did. Granted, this was my freshmen year before I was diagnosed. I was in the process during that semester, but was waiting on an official diagnosis. It came after the semester so I used the fact that I had a previously untreated mental illness. If you can get your doctor to say your depression was not good during the semester then I believe you should be fine.
As for sending me it you can, though I do not know how much help I would be with that, but I can always take a look at it.","chh5qrb",1,1400015051,"2014-05-13 21:04:11"

"449","No. I'm ADHD and I think it's such a turn on (sexually and like emotionally) when my husband can sit with me and be honest and open and put all the complexities and loose ends in his head out on the table, and be relaxed enough about it to not get to the point right away. Tbh I'm completely ok with him never getting to the point as long as his eyes light up and hes into what hes saying. It's rare, but I cherish it. 

Conversely, while hes neurotypical, when I go off on an everlong, all-encompassing tangent on an obscure topic that I'm excited about, and I suddenly feel sheepish and try to reel it in, he will prod and beg me to finish. He jokingly claims a major reason he married me is he figured at least he'd never be too bored, and very seriously claims that one of his biggest turn ons is watching me really into and excited about things that are new and foreign to him, which thanks to ADHD, I am constantly and exhaustedly finding new fodder for. 

Does everyone get it? Nope.  His brother low key makes fun of me and calls me weird, strange, kind of abnormal behind my back. But my husband doesn't stand for it, and more importantly, he loves just the things that come naturally to me. 

Don't try to force yourself to be neurotypical for the sake of love, because A) Heavens how boring and B) She'll never get to know you. If your eccentricities scare her off, let them do it now, not after you lose energy and time faking it only to eventually tire of the act, and C) Trust me shes  not that great of a life partner if she lacks the patience, empathy, and curiosity it takes to enjoy unfiltered you.

"480","(Tl:dr: maybe not technically, but if you space out frequently or aren't interested enough in a sport to practice, that hurts your ability.)

I don't think it's directly related, but I suppose it could be indirectly correlated. I think some common ADHD traits make sports more of a challenge, and not in a positive, character- or skill-building kind of way.

I played softball and soccer when I was a kid and would space out while playing outfield/defense. I didn't have enough interest in either sport to practice enough to get good so I could play more active positions. Unless you're really good you tend not to have a consistently active role in the game. And I don't have enough of a competitive instinct to care whether I win or lose. 

I'm not very interested in watching them either. All the interruptions (time outs, commercial breaks, injuries, etc) especially in football, but also baseball, basketball make those excruciating for me to watch on TV. 

On the other hand, although these aren't sports per se, I have spent probably literal years of my life on roller skates. I loved roller skating, and I was more than willing to put the time in to get good at it. I have a kick scooter now and I love riding that thing around. I like swimming too. So I guess maybe the appeal is these activities have a lot less structure, and are more about improving your own skill than competing with others. Plus if you do poorly you're only going to disappoint yourself and not an entire group of people.

So yeah there's a lot of ADHD stuff tied up in all of that but I don't think it's a direct cause or determination factor in sports ability.

Edit: I just looked it up and athletes are actually slightly more likely to have ADHD. Maybe it depends on what type of ADHD you have. I have predominantly inattentive type, but if you tend towards hyperactivity it may be very different.","fwr4q2x",1,1593733698,"2020-07-02 23:48:18"

"485","Definitely social anxiety, although not necessarily related to performance. 

I recommend finding an industry or role that you are comfortable with and moving forward with that. It didn't take me long to realize how much more comfortable I was as a freelancer than a full-time employee, and I did that for 10 years before big tech. It felt nice to be ""free,"" to be outside the main management chains and to just be able to concentrate on what I did best‚Äîcoding‚Äîand not be bound to all of the other stuff. In that environment, I was able to strive, and able to function more like a senior employee despite the lack of title. 

As for being unsure of my performance, I don't think that's limited to people with ADHD; Imposter Syndrome is very common and big companies, and when I was in tech, there were posters up internally saying things like ""You are not an imposter! You belong here!"" and courses dedicated to helping employees feel more confident in themselves and their roles. Virtually everyone I spoke too, no matter how high their level or how long their experience, said they felt like an imposter, and that they didn't belong.

Your social anxiety question is nuanced, I think. I feel like I'm obnoxious to be around, but I don't know how much of that is ADHD-- not focusing on others when I find them uninteresting, being hyperfocused on my own interests, not having patience for small talk and social niceties-- or if it's just my personality.

"547","While I can only add my own anecdotes to this, as a combined type I feel you've hit the nail on the head. 

Hyperactive types will receive a lot of negative social cues encouraging them to curb their behaviour since it's often too much for the 'average' person to keep up with. It's not even necessarily blurting things without thinking, they could well be thoughtful relevant things but the mere act of blurting can be a source of irritation. Since these negative cues come in from all sides all day every day it tends to be very stressful at best. This can and often does lead to anxiety as a general association between social contact and negativity can accumulates over the years. 

This is merely speculation but I feel that for combined types it could be especially bad. The hyperactivity will promote a lot of negative cues from others while the inattentiveness may cause other cues that could lead to positive interactions to be missed. What's more as anxiety begins to build this will only serve as a further distraction from social cues which in turn will cause more anxiety.

At any rate regardless of the cause if someone feels they are suffering from anxiety some form of assistance should be sought. Whether it's a one on one counsellor, a support group, or what have you. These are the people that have the patience and the wherewithal to help overcome such obstacles and there is absolutely nothing wrong with seeking help to do so.","c62xw12",10,1346704114,"2012-09-03 20:28:34"

"553","Now I mention two medications earlier in my post.  Intuniv and Kapvay.  Let me clarify /u/niczar 's post.  Well Intuniv is also known as Guanfacine Extended release.  The instant release form of Guanfacine which goes by many names but often the name tenex has an effect treatment period of 4 hours while Guanfacine ER (Intuniv) lasts 12 to 24 hours depending on some minor genetics.  Both the IR and ER treat ADHD but we found the ER version works better due to it ""being at consistent plasma levels"" in your body makes it less like a see saw and more like a constant change in your body and this treats ADHD better. Guanfacine was originally developed as a blood pressure medicine.  Intuniv / Guanfacine ER was recently approved in many European countries but the instant release version has been in europe for a very long time.

Now Clonidine is much the same thing with it being an instant release medicine.  Kapvay is the extended release pill, and Catapres is the extended release skin patch of Clonidine.  Now the difference between Clonidine and Intuniv is as follows.

 * You have many different types of norepinephrine receptors / sensors.  In humans 9 different DNA sites make norepinephrine receptors / sensors.  Some DNA sites can make only a single type of nonrepinephrine sensory, while some of them can make multiple different types of sensors depending on how much of the receipe is used just like in cooking you may have a complicated receipe to make a cake with frosting, or you can use just part of it to make a cake, or you can just use part of it to make a cake batter.  In addition to those 9 DNA sites your body can also make even more different types of norepinephrine sensors where it makes a combination receptor with nonrepinephrine+another neurotransmitter such as it does at several places in the body and brain such as when it makes combination receptors with norepinephrine+opiods also known as norepinephrine+endorphins but there are dozens of different combination receptors norepinephrine can make.  (Combination receptors are known as hetero-oligomers or heterodimers when it involves two different neurotransmitters, and homo-oligomers or homodimers when it involves two different subtypes of receptors of the same neurotransmitter)

 * So in humans those multiple nonrepinephrine sensors can be broken into 3 categories.  Alpha 1 category which has Alpha 1a, 1b, and 1d.  Alpha 2 categoryr which has Alpha 2a, 2b, and 2c.  And beta category which has beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3.  Now these 3 different subfamilies can be described as having different effects almost complete opposite effects for the Alpha 2 family decreases an internal cell messenger called cAMP while the beta family increases cAMP, and the alpha 1 family modifies different internal cell messengers and increase calcium.

* Now with treating ADHD the goal is to increase activation of the Alpha 2a family of subreceptors for norepinephrine.  Now triggering Alpha 2a has some anti anxiety properties and blood pressuring lowering effects.  That said triggering Alpha 2b, and 2c have increased blood pressure lowering effect and anti anxiety properties.

 * Intuniv is a drug that can turn on Alpha 2a, 2b, and 2c receptors but it is 10 times stronger for Alpha 2a being turned on vs 2b and 2c.

 * Kapvay is a drug that can turn on all three Alpha 2 receptors on and it is roughly equal for those 3.  It can also affect another neurotransmitter called Imidazoline.

 * Intuniv is desired for ADHD for it often gives less side effects at treating ADHD than Kapvay.  Intuniv can make you tired, but Kapvay is far more likely to make you tired for the Alpha 2b and 2c being activated more produces a greater change in energy levels, anxiety, and blood pressure.  Kapvay while its not as desired to treat ADHD is a better/stronger anti anxiety medicine and blood pressure lowering medicine.  Which one is best for you depends on the person but if the main goal is ADHD you often try Intuniv first, but if your main goal is to treat other conditions you may use Kapvay first.

Both of these medicines can be used by themselves or in combination with stimulants.  Both of them are very common to find in the US and other countries since Clonidine has been used in medicine for 40 years, and Guanfacine has been used in medicine for 30 years.

That said the extended release forms of these medicines may not be available in your country or they may be more expensive.  In the US within the last year the patent and exclusivity period for Intuniv expired so now we have 7 manufactures of Intuniv so the price difference has rapidly changes in the last year in the US.

Kapvay also recently lost its exclusivity period for it being the ER version of Clonidine so now multiple makers make Kapvay.  Do not forget with Clonidine there is also the extended release skin patch which goes by the name Catapres-TTS (the TTS stands for transdermal / skin patch delivery).

I bring all of this up for some countries do not have the ER forms or if they do it may be more expensive yet the IR versions are approved for other conditions but not for ADHD without your doctor prescribing it ""off label"" (off label means the drug was approved for something else like blood pressure, yet the doctor can still prescribe it for ADHD).

If the meds helped, they helped and there is nothing at all wrong with that. Most people have to titrate up over time and theres nothing wrong or unusual with that either. You're taking them because your brain makes the wrong chemicals do the wrong things, not so you can get all speedy or whatever. I would say go back on them. Up side?

It has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research. It is not listed in either of the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or ICD.

Try to find somebody who understands you and stick to this person or plural. Great advise for social anxiety I know.

"618","Story of my life the past few months. I started a new job 5 months ago and I'm still making the same careless mistakes. This job involves a lot of attention to detail and very complicated tasks with multiple steps to each one and I kept forgetting how to do them. Even after writing cheat sheets for myself, I would forget little things. My boss and coworker (the only other person there that does this same job aka the one that had to fix my mistakes) finally confronted me about it, although he was much nicer about it than I think yours seems to be (the boss, not the coworker. She was condescending as hell and made me feel stupid all the time). I apologized and explained that I have ADHD and that I was in the process of discussing medication options with my doctor. Since then they've both been more patient and understanding and they've asked what they can do to help me with the issues I was having. I explained why it was happening and showed that I was taking steps to fix it. And since then I've also just been finding ways to make myself slow down and pay attention, which hasn't been easy. Try talking to your boss to explain your ADHD. They may be understanding.  As far as the late thing, that's something you just have to get under control. I've lost many jobs over the years because I was Always late. It's been my biggest issue as far as work. Luckily, I've only been late one time with this job because NyQuil made me sleep past my alarm. I've made it a priority to really work on that and I guess it's worked. If you have to, make yourself get to work an hour early every day and just sit in the parking lot until you have to go in. That way, if you're running late, you're not actually going to be late. Don't berate yourself for your mistakes. I know how easy that is to do, because I do it a lot. I'm learning how to be more patient with myself. When I mess up, I do get down on myself but then I think of why it happened and how I can prevent it from happening again.

If this is the case please go to your doctor and mention your issues.  Even things like the sensory issues they have medicines that help such as SNRIs (which are different than SSRIs) or certain forms of anti-convulsants such as Gabapentin which act as mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety meds, and turn down sensory overload.

Break your tasks down smaller, into something you can finish in 15 minutes, increase that time until you find your limit.

"637","Let me put your mind at ease.  Treatment and medication is not going to be a cure all.  Those tools you have in place?  They are only going to enhance what traditional treatment is going to provide for you.  Let me give you a little background to explain why I say that.

I am 34 years old.  I was finally formally diagnosed at 15 or so years old with ADHD.  Prior to that, I was just described as a ""hyperactive child"" and my parents just shrugged it off.  At 19 I was taken off of meds, with doctors citing that I was an adult and adults ""don't have ADHD"" and it is a ""childhood disorder.""  I was mislabeled as bipolar and incorrectly medicated for several years.  I finally got the correct diagnosis back and the correct medication but that stigma stuck with me and between that and being in and out of having insurance I was on and off the medication for a while.  A month ago I had a complete meltdown because of it because the only support I had was the medication and that stress finally got to me.  Now I am working on implementing some other tools.  I am researching other supports I can create for myself that will help me get through everything I have to do.  I am a working mom and the primary earner in my family and I cannot afford to fall apart, so I get where you are coming from.  ","cxq0dpz",3,1449468562,"2015-12-07 06:09:22"

I was late for everything. And my bosses would talk to me like I was just a lazy piece of shit who didn‚Äôt want to grow up and realize you can‚Äôt sleep all day. It really fucked me up. Once I was diagnosed and went on Adderall, I used the Adderall to wake up. I had it on my nightstand with a glass of water, and as soon as my alarm went off, I‚Äôd take one and go back to sleep. Once the Adderall kicked in I‚Äôd be wide awake and ready to take over the world. 

From that point on, I took pride in always being on time or early to work because I‚Äôd been so ashamed before. And it kinda made me angry when I realized it was never my fault, it was my condition, and people made me feel like shit over something I couldn‚Äôt help. 

I really hope you can get diagnosed and treated. Just remember this: you may have to go to more than one doctor. Some doctors are biased and don‚Äôt like to give out stimulants, and they‚Äôll just try to give you antidepressants, or they believe outdated information, like that only kids have it.

My dr called in a new script and hid it in my purse. 

My mother will never know anything about my medical ‚Äúissues‚Äù. I no longer live there but I have chosen a non family friend as emergency contact. My family will not interfere with my health ever again.

But now I get what half this thread rants about occasionally... The people that ask...
""Well I mean, don't you think maybe you're diets bad or it's something else"". No... No bro.... I've tried everything I've found.

Every single appointment I have gets written in my datebook, entered into my phone, my computer calendar, AND the crazy notebook I keep beside my desk to write down every single thought or activity I have done, or will do, all day long. And then I set alarms to remind me a 2 days out, 1 day out, the morning of the appointment and an hour before I have to leave. If it's not in the calendar, it doesn't exist and they shouldn't count on my appearance at said meeting.  I know it seems like a waste of time and that it would be a lot more work, but I have to be honest, it really does help me focus, is a good reminder, and I keep them so that if i ever have to go back and double check if i've done something or talked to someone, it's there. I date a new page every day. Occasionally I flip through my week to see if there is something I've missed.  It's made me MUCH more efficient and seeing it on paper in list form really does help me stay focused and on task, and to be able to refer back to it about what i was doing, if I happen to get distracted.

"679","Yeah so in my experience I've been prescribed for 3 years.. in the Beginning it was easier to take days on and off ... then all of a sudden a life change happens or you have a deadline and things can get harder faster if you are not aware... I've taken adderall for short spurts and long periods. When I've taken it for 3/4 months straight my euphoria lasts for the first 1 month, then after that I loose the I can do everything stage and then catch it again with increased dosage (*self prescribed at this point). Maybe you need more depending on your body or maybe the meds are just working and ur not high anymore. Whatever it is... after 2 months I realized my script would go faster and I'd have to either take a break or find a friend to help me out until I get my script.. I'd hate to trade bc then I'd owe someone so I'd wind up buy some off the street to supplement me when I ran out.  Then I'd fill my script and it would be like xmas. After 4 months (of everyday use/abuse)  could would take 30-60mg at a time ..usually twice a day.. it took me a broke bank account and some soul searching to realize I was out of hand... 

The point is.. dont go that route lol.

Now, what I do is I only take it when I'm going into work in the early morning. I'll make sure I take 2-3 days off a week just to give my body a break.. I take a ton of supplements to take care of my kidneys and liver and to replenish what the amphetamine depletes me of.. when I do this.. days off arent bad.

"694","This falls squarely into the ""speak to your doctor about medication"" category. I will, however, point a few things out unrelated to a specific medication.

These kinds of meds change brain chemistry, hopefully for the better. However, often with that change come new challenges. Such as noticing things we never noticed before which are bothersome, or we might feel full of energy and a need to act, but can't do the things we suddenly want to for some reason.

This is one of the reasons most people must do more than just take meds for mental issues, the meds rewire the brain and we need to relearn how to think properly and control ourselves.

I have no idea if this helps or not. I any case, speak to your doctor and/or some mental health professional about this sooner rather than later.","feg6d8r",1,1579079071,"2020-01-15 09:04:31"

"715","No, there's nothing wrong with it. You *need* the medication in order to function in a way that makes you happy and able to live more fully than you otherwise would. People usually compare it to glasses for sight-impaired people or insulin for diabetics, but this form of dependency is more akin to people with generalized anxiety disorder being dependent on anti-anxiety medication or clinically-depressed people being dependent on anti-depressants. They provide a net benefit and improve your quality of life, so there's nothing wrong with it.

tl;dr If your medication usage is improving your life, then it's not bad to be dependent on it. It only becomes bad, and turns into addiction, if taking the medication actively harms you and yet you feel compelled and unable to *stop* taking it.","cwrvd9d",1,1446912441,"2015-11-07 16:07:21"
"716","So I'm finally, after 39 years of getting tangled up in how to deal with this disorder, getting some stuff straight. I always wrestled with the conflict between knowing beyond a doubt that I am intelligent, and the fact that I can't accomplish some things that are common, everyday tasks. Like, for instance, finding my goddamn car keys (if they aren't in the basket where they belong). I've realized that I create my own motivation by essentially brutalizing myself emotionally - berating myself in my own head, saying shit that I grew up hearing about how much of a failure I am. 

It's a coping mechanism to get some performance, but it catches up to you eventually. This disorder is not an information or intention deficit. It's an executive function deficit. 

ADHD people have the normal range of general factor intelligence - from genius to mentally disabled. The executive function deficits tend to cause difficulty focusing on learning topics we aren't interested in, and there are often some other learning disabilities associated with ADHD. But we ain't dumb in comparison to the general population.","de7e5w7",4,1488046161,"2017-02-25 18:09:21"

Maybe the drug needs time to build up in your body or something (I don't actually know the science behind it), but day 1 tends to be weird. My day 1 I felt like I was floating around outside myself, it was extremely strange and I hated it. Day 2 is when I started noticing positive effects.

As for giving you motivation. Think about it this way, every other person in the world has to motivate themselves, it's just even harder with ADHD. Ideally the drugs level the playing field, but they don't give you super powers. I found once I starting taking my medication regularly it took me some time to figure out how to get things done and study. It was easier, it was a lot better, but I still had to learn how to do it all over again with a brain that was now functioning much better.

"749","/u/aszantu referred to this nicely: don't feel bad abandoning failed systems that you've implemented. Who cares that these systems help millions of people - the indisputable fact is they failed to help you. Statistically, this makes sense to me. You have ADHD.

Last year I spent a full day printing everything I could possibly need for all of my courses, and organizing them in a binder according to course syllabi. The next day, I put every single assignment - minor and major - into my iCalendar, color coded them by class, and figured out iCloud to sync it between my phone and laptop.

Turns out, having a notebook with stapled packets opened to random pages and shoved inside the plastic cover or that day's ""notes"" from class was messy, but it worked for me. ""Messiness"" isn't on the syllabus as a grading criteria - despite what my parents and the tutors they paid to fix me always urged.

Historically, I've been relatively successful remembering to have the right shit shoved in the right notebooks (I usually only take things out when they're long past relevance) and remember to bring the right notebook to class. Since I've been generally aware of the fact that on any given day, I probably have work to do, and on any given day, I have  to physically prepare my backpack for class, I've abandoned all intricate attempts to drastically change myself organizationally.

You know why I sucked at organizing from a young age? Because my clothes will always just end up back on the floor, I'll probably remember where a paper was placed in my backpack (although taking an extra minute to find it won't kill me), and I allow the impulse to interpret a squirrel's body language to sidetrack even a pleasant experience. So why would I program my phone to remind me of a routine assignment for Psychology while I'm trying to take a shit and cast judgment upon people with Tinder?

I have a big desk in my room with a TV that serves as double-monitor for homework, and I base whatever productivity I have from a list of shit I should do on my desk. I don't take it with me, I don't follow it obsessively, but when the going gets tough - or at least feels tough - it's a tangible reminder that today is merely a continuation of all the days before, and these are still the only real things standing between me and my short-term goals.

My often-ignored, humbly casual list hasn't given me a life plan by any means, but at least it's stopped my tangible short-term concerns from adding false time-sensitive urgency to things I can (and should) figure out at a more appropriate time.

Instead of trying to be impressive with my organization, I've refocused on impressing myself with my productive output towards my self-defined, sometimes re-defined life goals. Everyone's different, but in order to be productive, I need a very basic level of organization. Beyond this basic level, there's no need to push myself. If you've tried and failed at building the perfect structure for your life, and if you have ADHD, chances are, you should consider going the opposite way and simplifying, streamlining, or clarifying your own adaptive habits.

Accept the messiness that comes with your ADHD life and view it as an artist, not as a cleaning lady.","cdziqbd",2,1386802908,"2013-12-11 23:01:48"

"772","It's definitely tough to not get frazzled in the moment and it's understandable why you were anxious. Anxiety seems to make the disorganization worse and clinicals are stressful as it is. Being a little disorganized won't make you a bad nurse. You'll just have to take extra precautions when you're out of school and clinicals will be the time where you learn what works for you. What helped me when I was a nursing assistant and was having one of those bad days was to stop, even if it's just for a minute and not do anything. It gave me a chance to regain clarity in my mind.



I worked with a charge nurse who confided in me that she has ADHD when I walked in on her crying because she couldn't find a patient's chart. I would occasionally see her running around looking for things in the nurse's station. She's been a nurse for a long time and is one of the best nurse's I worked with. She kept a notepad on her with very detailed notes and trained herself to always put it back in her pocket. She also used alarms to make sure her timing was on point with meds, etc. The reason why I'm telling you about her is because YOU CAN DO THIS! 


People with adhd tend to thrive on stress and it can manifest depending on how you're already feeling. If I'm already nervous about something, it'll manifest as anxiety and I'll be a frazzled mess. If I'm not feeling nervous, I just get into the zone. You were probably a little nervous since you're a new student and still learning everything, even if you didn't feel like you were. Might sound weird, but next time you're going to clinical try getting yourself hyped up a bit with good energy so you can use the stress to your advantage.

"776","I‚Äôm the non-ADHD parent (but am married to one!). I‚Äôm not sure if my perspective is helpful, but I have a couple things to say on the subject. 

TLDR; having kids is hard. Having kids with special needs is harder, but not *THAT* hard and it depends on your capacity (and patience) to parent.

So odds are pretty good our 2 (still young) kids have ADHD. The eldest is special needs, but due to his developmental delays (not-so-delayed anymore as he‚Äôs catching up to his peers) it‚Äôs hard to know if the behaviors tend toward ADHD or ASD. So that remains to be diagnosed (we‚Äôll see the doctor this summer). He‚Äôs in a special needs class currently. Like one of the other posters, it sounds like they had low proprioception, too. So we have to do a lot of rough sensory play to get his body to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù although my every-contradictory little boy is also gets defensive if you try to touch him before he‚Äôs ready.  He also has mild physical disabilities.

I got pregnant with our second child before his diagnosis (rare genetic disorder).And my husband had a vasectomy within a few months of her birth. Not because we didn‚Äôt want more kids, but because we didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd have the energy for anymore since we had to devote so much time to our son.

If I‚Äôm being truthful, I think I have a harder time parenting the children than my husband does because he sees himself in them and is patient AS FUCK with them. I can even say I‚Äôm jealous of the relationship they have. He likes to say I‚Äôm the one that gets shit done, that fights like hell for all services our son gets, to be a presence in the school, to juggle the appointments with specialists, etc. He provides the extra emotion and affection my personality lacks. And we‚Äôre ok with that.

If he was diagnosed before we had kids, would it have stopped us? Even without the diagnosis, I knew full well my husband‚Äôs issues (I knew them before he did since he has very little self-awareness). And I‚Äôm so rational about things, you might think I‚Äôm nutty for saying this but the only reason I entered this marriage contract with him was because I wanted kids. Otherwise we might have just lived together and continued the ‚Äúsingle‚Äù life. But I wanted kids with him because where I struggled, he succeeded and vice versa. I am not sure why he wanted kids with me. Probably the sex part. Lol! I kid.

Anyway, are some days the WORST? Yes. Every day is hard, but as a parent, it‚Äôs becomes your normal. My mom told me the other day that she and my husband had a private conversation a couple weeks ago. She asked him, if we could, would he like to have another child? And he said yes. It would be hard, but he wouldn‚Äôt mind. 

And in 10-15 years, I can‚Äôt wait to ask my son, who has a 50% chance of passing on his genetic disorder to his children if he would choose to have kids. His disorder is has a spectrum ranging from non-verbal autistic with severe cognitive delays to‚Ä¶ well to him. I guess we‚Äôll see!

"781","Op before you think you see a pattern with all these diets cut out carbs, and thus carbs are bad, please don't.

Carbs are necessary for your body to function.  Almost all your body can run without carbs, but the nervous system and the brain are not like this.  They need carbohydrates to function, or if no carbohydrates are available ketones which is made from fat.

ADHD people already have enough problems with their brain.  When you stress the brain even further such as depriving it of energy you get less electrical activity in the brain, and most of adhd is caused by lower electrical activity in certain parts of the brain.  In other words you can make ADHD worse by cutting out all carbs.  There is a reason why it is harder to focus when you are hungry, and when you are hungry your body craves things that are easy to break down, things that you start digesting as soon as it hits the tongue.  Those type of foods are almost always carbs.

------


And some people have a genetic profile that loves carbs.  Carbs are low in fats and such, so if you eat the right carbs it can be very healthy for you.  Have the wrong genetic profile though and a high carb diet will just make you fat.  My family a high carb diet makes you fat, a low carb diet makes you more fit and with more energetic.  With my genetics as long as I eat enough carbs to fuel my brain I am good (the brain always gets first priority with carbs).  With every person you need to eat 20 grams of carbs per more per day.  I do not count calories or carbs, but I know my intake is less than a 100g per day.


-----

You should be doing what I am about to say no matter how much carbs (high or low) is in your diet.

* Spread the carbs out throughout the day.  Some people that eat carbs do it 6 times a day.  It is easier your on your liver, and your body can't choose to hold carbs for long periods of time.  It either has to use the carbs to do something that needs energy, convert the carbs into fat, or have the carbs leave the body and return to the earth.
* Make the amount of carbs you eat in a sitting a small amount.
* Pick healthy carbs with lots of fiber, the more processed the food is the worse it is on your body.","cis3790",-1,1404863823,"2014-07-08 23:57:03"

I encourage you to see if you can turn your camera off. Even small breaks where you can feel free to NOT stare at the screen make a big difference.  Changing your location in the house might help too. If possible, take your laptop to a different room for a bit.

You might also consider emailing a trusted teacher or the school counselor with your concerns. Believe me, you are definitely not the only student with these struggles.

My emotions feel ""deeper"" and more intense. This un nerves me a little, even embarrasses me. My SO saw me in an emotional moment and reacted with some concern because she's never seen me react to this depth before.

I was also having some real scary episodes like PTSD related stuff, that I now understand as ""rebound effect"", and (gladly) this effect is reducing (probably because I know what it is caused by and what it going on).

Maybe this is the ""normal"" that so many others have lived with, and we are adjusting to it.

"792","I'm in a similar boat. You should look into CBT.

I say this because... meds don't fix everything. They can help a lot, but you still need to work that extra bit to get things done. Things like creating habits and breaking tasks down into manageable ones should be able to help you now and when you're pregnant _and_ later when you're on meds.

Personally, I also go for stim jewelry just to keep my fingers occupied if possible. Easier for women I think, more choices :)

Lastly, I suggest getting a doctor that can still diagnose you with ADHD right now, so you have an easier path later on dealing with meds. Find a second opinion if you must.

(FWIW I made a deal with my psych to be on very low dose Adderall IR while trying, and then stop altogether when I pee on a stick successfully. Lots of women take stims in the first couple weeks because they're unaware they're pregnant. You may be able to suggest this - it's just a matter of risk management.)","cs5ut5d",6,1434252246,"2015-06-14 03:24:06"

I keep small containers of lunch meat, cut up cheese, cooked quinoa, washed/cut veggies, etc. in the fridge. If I *have* to cook something, or think about what to eat, I'll put it off or forget entirely until I get dizzy. I can usually manage 5 minutes in the kitchen too cook an egg at least once a day, and add garlic/spinach/quinoa/whatever I have on hand to make it more substantial. When I don't feel like eating but know I need to (e.g. in the morning before I head to class) I can usually at least get down a small spoonful of almond butter. The prep work is a pain, but once or twice a week I take my laptop and camp out in the kitchen to prep a bunch of things and get it out of the way, then I don't have to think about it for awhile.

For eating food-- when I was single and lived alone, it was really tough to shop and cook responsibly --recipes and packages of food aren't really designed for one!

With the Thai, I'd order enough to give me dinner and lunch, and Thai has lots of veggies.

If you're near a Trader Joes, they have good frozen stuff that's quick and healthy.

Also, I went to the Greek Produce store a couple of times a week, and got salad fixings b/cI love salad and Feta.  But when you're single, if you don't love it and it's not easy, you won't eat it.  Just admit that to yourself and keep healthy-easy stuff. (rice cakes and PB,for example. Or yogurt. Cheese sticks Quick and nourishing.)  Oh! And use disposable dishes. That makes eating less of a hassle...

And then, keep easy healthy stuff on hand, but DON'T keep candy handy!

I have anxiety and I'm always really nervous that I'll somehow screw up and score like a 5 on any type of intelligence test (I ended up scoring 'slightly above average' somehow).

My only point was that the definition of a learning disability sort of fits with what ADHD does. The difference, I assume, is that a learning disability (as a category of disabilities) is a defect of the brain that directly influences a persons ability to interpret and store information. 

Someone with ADHD can store and interpret fine. The disability is just getting the information to a place where it can be stored and interpreted. 

ADHD does make learning more difficult. It is a disability. But it is not categorized as a Learning Disability. ","dwvrm03",1,1522969867,"2018-04-05 23:11:07"

In fact, I think it has worked against me in some environments, as people make assumptions about you based on their conception of ADHD and then look for anything you do that reinforces it. But I prefer to filter out those people rather than hide from them.

I have a number of other ADHD people in my life, so I can often share things with them and they get it. Non-ADHD people have a hard time understanding. On the other hand, there are a lot of people out there that I don't understand very well, either. 

It takes time to grow into your new self and not be embarrassed or apologize. I was diagnosed after 50 years of hiding and trying to catch up with everyone around me. The diagnosis was actually a big relief. But learning what that label really means to me is not an overnight thing.

I've also noticed a lot of posts of people asking for advice, or offering tips on how to improve things without the use of medication. We ARE trying.

You can try to educate him, as I did my wife. It was hard and took a while, and eventually I just took the Dexedrine regardless of what she thought. Once I was actually taking it she immediately saw the difference and changed her mind, maybe he'll do the same.

"895","I use to sit for hours at my desk with just the lamp on and my ipod. I found sometimes if I had music playing, it would block out all other distractions and I could stream through my homework. I couldn't sit silently at night.

But sometimes nothing would help, english homework was always the longest every time I had to write an essay or read a couple of chapters, math would mostly click but I remember some nights just dragging my feet through every (math) problem, especially if they had multiple steps to solve.

Other times I would become sleepy and lose all concentration and willpower and fall asleep with my head on my desk and then wake up and try to finish my work with mixed results

my single(divorced)foster mother never noticed my struggle and just thought the school was giving too much homework when(if) she saw me late up at night, but I'm pretty sure I would make excuses as to why I was up so late out of fear or shame that I wasn't capable or I don't know what, but I would hide that shame which would lead to guilt if I didn't complete certain tasks which would then lead to regret and resentment and doubt and start a vicious cycle.

I thought it was normal at the time and didn't speak up, I thought that was just the way it was or I was too lazy or unmotivated, I also didn't want to accept that maybe something might be wrong with me and having to deal with the stigma, yes the public stigma but more my own personal stigma made up in my mind about taking medication, I always looked at it as a problem and never a tool. 

I was already diagnosed as a child with adhd but then was taken off the medication by my first foster family who thought I didn't need it but then I had anger outbursts from a whole host of problems which they then thought was only anger management so I was put only on risperdal and no stimulant still had problems with homework in school.","dfg0hui",2,1490567050,"2017-03-26 22:24:10"

"906","""Hyperfocus"" is an overloaded word that is often used to refer to two superficially similar -- but fundamentally different -- mental states: flow and perseveration.

Flow is a positive, beneficial state of deep immersion and high engagement in a task or activity, and is also usually accompanied by enjoyment of the task/activity. It's something almost all people are capable of, and specifically is not a benefit imparted by ADHD.

Perseveration, on the other hand, is part of the ADHD disorder. It is the inability to switch between tasks or mental activities. It's that thing that makes you spend 10 hours doing something non-stop even when you know you need to stop and do something else.

He's in therapy to help with it. There have been some things we've implemented to help:

1. Have an object that it's okay to beat up. Seriously, go buy a punch bag. 

2. If you catch yourself before the throwing shit phase, link your first fingers together and pull. It's a strong hold that will help ground you. You'll also be able to use a lot of force without hurting yourself (and you can't throw shit with your fingers locked together!)

3. Walk away. Tell your SO (out of any rages) that you may need to walk away to calm yourself. This isn't you not listening to her, it's you not acting like a child who isn't allowed candy again. 

But seriously, apologize. Get a small gift, fix your glasses as best you can until you can get more, fix whatever you broke. Think about getting into anger management to help you learn.

"911","I can understand you have beef with the pharmaceutical companies, but unfortunately stimulants are both scientifically proven to work, and from personal experience I can tell they make a night-and-day difference.
There are other things, but they usually have more side effects than you'd like. For example Weed works for some people, but that will come with a whole load of other things you don't like. Caffeine works for others, but it's much less effective than the medications, and at the doses needed it'll probably make you super jittery and anxious.

Personally, I'd advocate for at least trying it for a couple of days or weeks, and afterwards make an informed decision. You're still free to not take medication because of your views on the pharmaceutical world, but at least you'll know what you're giving up...","d2qvmxo",5,1462275207,"2016-05-03 11:33:27"

However, I never learned much about the symptoms/effects of these brain issues I had, and I also never heard the word ‚Äúadhd‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until I read the Percy jackson books in fifth grade that I learned what adhd was! I had to go and ask my parents if that was the same as what I had.

Through middle school, I read some books, and into high school and college, I started doing some research on the internet, learning more about executive dysfunction and the parts of adhd that affected me most, learning from others with adhd, etc.","gg42qhf",1,1608181943,"2020-12-17 05:12:23"

I'm not sure, but I'd honestly say being competitive is the motivation that's probably gotten me the farthest in life because anything can be competition.

"925","I also know in the past I'd get into this same type of cycle if I was low-key sleep deprived. It happened to me with Vyvanse so I had to go on something shorter acting and getting the right amount of sleep has helped my non-med days. I definitely used to feel the same as you but now I really don't with a med adjustment and monitoring my sleep w/ my fitbit. I've noticed I need a decent amount of deep sleep to feel functioning -- meds or not. 

My other tip is to use your meds to make your life ADHD friendly. On meds, I focus on creating realistic storage solutions (love the book organizing for ADHD by Susan Pinksy - I hype this a lot) and it's helped make my life more ""autopilot"" off meds. I can do stuff without thinking about it - laundry isn't daunting because I have a spot for all my clothes, dishes aren't daunting because there's a spot for all of them to go and stuff like that. 

Look at the skills/traits you appreciate the most while medicated and try to find creative ways to accommodate those things off meds. My medicated brain is getting good at finding ways to remove roadblocks for my non-medicated brain, especially with things like chores/cleaning/errands. Make sure you're getting the right vitamins/nutrition too, because that always impacts my ADHD off meds. Sometimes it's something as simple as not getting enough vitamin C or potassium or something - I can be super sensitive to vitamin deficiencies. ","e2c4qtv",6,1531510164,"2018-07-13 19:29:24"

A couple things to keep in mind. First, 30 mg is a really low dosage. That's about equal to 12 mg of Adderall. I didn't feel any benefits from Adderall until I hit the 40 mg level. 

Secondly, I've found there's two different benefits to the stimulant meds. There's the stimulant effects on the body and the stimulant effects on the mind. The effects on the body are very noticable, you feel energized. It's basically an amphetamine high. When that wears off you feel really shitty. Both the high and the downturn diminish over time. The mental effects are a lot more subtle. Those don't really diminish over time. A lot of people think that the lack of a high is due to a tolerance to the meds, but having that smooth out is actually a good thing.

I've seen some studies showing effect and some showing nothing, but his meta-analysis seems to show that there is a long term effect. I was just wondering about real-world results, people without ADHD doing WM training and showing results is one thing but for people with ADHD it may or may not be similar. 

Have you tried any of these yourself? I'd be very interested in hearing your experience.

 [**Serotonin syndrome**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin%20syndrome): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Serotonin syndrome__ is a potential symptom of any number of life-threatening drug interactions which may follow therapeutic drug use, combination, [overdose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdose) of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs. Serotonin syndrome is not an [idiopathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic) drug reaction; it is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the [CNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system) and/or [peripheral nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system).  For this reason, some experts strongly prefer the terms __serotonin toxicity__ or __serotonin toxidrome__ which more accurately reflect that it is a form of [poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison).   Other names include __serotonin sickness__, __serotonin storm__, __serotonin poisoning__, __hyperserotonemia__, or __serotonergic syndrome__.

The list goes on and on.  My recommendation:don't use it to cope.

"999","&gt; Stimulants are rough on your body. Your liver, your heart. It's not good for you for long periods of time.

Source? I'm aware that stimulants can cause cardiovascular side effects, but it's always been my understanding that those are situations where people should lower their dose and/or take another medication until that problem is under control.

I also knew that stimulant medications are metabolized by the liver (and in the case of Vyvanse, it's a crucial part of how the drug works) but so are a lot of other drugs. The NIH actually has [a website called ""LiverTox""](http://livertox.nlm.nih.gov/index.html) where you can look up information on drug-related liver injury. The pages on methylphenidate and amphetamines both say that they've been linked to rare cases of acute liver damage, generally when they're abused or taken at high doses. I don't see anything to indicate that they're likely to cause any kind of liver damage when taken at normal doses.

Interestingly, the page about atomoxetine (Straterra) also says it's been linked to rare cases of acute liver damage, and the one case they describe in detail was from a girl taking it at a normal therapeutic dose. This isn't to say that Straterra is more dangerous than the stimulants. The point is that if you look at *any* prescription drug you'll find some rare cases where someone had serious health problems that were obviously caused by the drug. But those cases are extreme outliers, and you can't use them as the basis of any kind of advice that would apply to most people.","cnv6lwn",1,1421781101,"2015-01-20 19:11:41"

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

"1041","Girl with ADHD here. I've got two pieces of advice:

1) When you're talking to a girl, ask her about what she's interested in. Movies, music, hobbies, etc. Find something you have in common, and build from there. Good relationships happen when both people have some interests in common. While there are relationships where the only thing they have in common is sexual attraction, those are a bit less stable.

2) No, you're probably not being too nice. Girls in general want their boyfriend to be nice (if a girl is chasing jerks, either he puts on a nice fa√ßade, and/or she's a bit messed up emotionally, but that's her problem). The key is to be more than just nice. Let other aspects of your personality shine. Being nice is a basic requirement, like having wheels and an engine is a basic requirement for a car. And with car shopping, it's the features other than wheels that make someone choose one car over another (convertible? 4 wheel drive?) Similarly, it's the parts of yourself other than being nice that will lead a girl to choose you over another guy who's also nice.","d4svg7f",19,1467223812,"2016-06-29 18:10:12"

"1053","**No you do not have a right to be mad at your psych.  He probably honestly did not know better.  Yes though your anger is a legitimate feeling, and you should not be ashamed that you are feeling anger.**  Let me explain why, or at least what I guess happened.


TLDR  **This is going to be a long post, I am going to try to break it up in parts to make it easier to read.  I am going to try to explain how science views adhd and the limitations of science and our abilities to test ADHD.**


ADHD is a real problem, it is a real cognition state that can cause great difficulties for a person.  *Scientists and doctors understand to a good idea* **what** *is happening, but they do not have a good understand* **why** *it happens.*  The reason why they do not have a good understanding **why** it is happening is there is no good scientific tools on figuring out why you have adhd.  One type of tool, ""objective psych tests"" similar to iq test do not work with finding out you have ADHD, yet these same type of test are very useful for finding out other type of psychiatric conditions.  You can't also diagnosed ADHD by blood tests, you can't also diagnose ADHD by an individual brain scan or any other form of objective form of scientific measuring.


**We know ADHD exists for our wonderful brain is good at sensing patterns.**  Humanity throughout the hundreds of years of years has had some really great and special individuals, people that are on a different wavelength, and some of those people noticed patterns about certain individuals.  According to Dr Barkley the guy you linked earlier we been describing the symptoms of ADHD since the 1700s.  These brilliant people came up with theories about people, and why people act the way they do.  The first part of the scientific method is coming up with a theory.  The next part of the scientific method is testing the theory.  Well with ADHD our tests for ADHD really really stink.  Yet we know ADHD exists for though enough trial and error we have found ways to improve those certain people through drugs and medicine.  Based on those drugs and medicine we got an understand **what is happening** and through enough testing we got some idea on the **why** but our understanding of the why is very limited.


-----


We know **ADHD is caused by low dopamine and low norepinephrine.**  These are two of the four chemicals that are needed to make the brain function.  But these two of four chemicals affect different parts of the brain differently, dopamine really affects the frontal lobe of the brain and affects very little of the rest of the brain besides some parts in the lower middle.  [See here picture showing where dopamine receptors are in the brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine#mediaviewer/File:Dopamine_pathways.svg) Norepinephrine affects the lower parts of the brain that is closer to the brainstem.  It also helps your right half of the brain to talk to the left half.


Because you have lower amounts of these neurotransmitters (but still have these neurotransmitters for they are necessary to function) there is **underutilization of certain parts of your brain.**  People with ADHD also have a very slight decrease in size in certain parts of the brain, but this decrease is very slight and you won't be able to diagnose a person with ADHD based on things such as MRIs since it is still within the normal distribution of the population, but gather up hundreds and thousands of brain scans and you can see a pattern that certain parts of the brain are smaller with people with ADHD.  That said the electrical activity of the brain and how certain parts of the brain is underutilized is what causes ADHD not the size of the brain.  Unfortunately you can't measure dopamine or neurophinine directly, and MRA which read electrical activity in the brain instead of just taking static pictures are expensive and not very useful for diagnosing individuals since the chemical tracer to do the scan lasts less than 2 minutes and thus you can't really use it as a diagnostic tool.


Now the frontal lobes, and some other parts of the brain such as back lobe of the head (the temporal lobe, the part of your brain that is responsible for time management, and balancing competing interest.)  **Are responsible for something that the psychs call executive function.**  Executive function is the decision making part of your brain, it regulates cognitive control and supervisory attentional system; it affects many things including your short term working memory, reasoning, task flexibility, problem solving as well as planning, and execution of tasks.


**Problem is there is no good short term scientific tests or psychiatric tests on analyzing whether someone has good or bad executive function** Having someone repeat a pattern of numbers and colors do not tell you if you have good impulse control or if you have good money management, it does not tell you if you are good at making friends or if you are good at studying.  The only way to figure out someone has ADHD is to have an outside individual watch them and have that person's brain notice a pattern.  Given enough history our brains are good at noticing patterns.


-----


**After you notice a pattern of ADHD the only way to confirm you have ADHD is to treat for ADHD.**  Treatment (medicine and behavior) usually produces a big and dramatic change in the person.


So in sum ADHD is sometimes accused of being bad science.  This could not be further from the truth, it is very good science but our scientific tools to test the ADHD really really suck.  In such a situation the answer is not to give up but to keep on testing and testing till you understand the problem more and you create better engineering tools to test your science.


ADHD is also a thing that moves on a spectrum.  Some people may have lower dopamine and norepinephrine than the general population, they may suffer a very mild rehabilitation, they may show some signs of ADHD but if it doesn't damage their life for they have found ways to cope.  If your life is not debhalitated according to the psychiatrist's you can't be diagnosed with ADHD, ADHD is a spectrum and just because you are not in the median does not mean you are abnormal to be labeled with a disorder.  There is so much variety and distribution of humans within humanity.


-----


Now people with ADHD are not disordered, they are not broken, and they do not suffer a brain problem.  While they may have lower utilization of certain parts of their brain, other parts of the brain may have a greater utilization to compensate.  ADHD people are often more abstract than people without ADHD, this may lead to greater creativity, greater passion, greater energy, able to see a problem from a different angle, being able to create new ideas, theories, possibilities, better dreaming etc.  ADHD people merely view the world differently than ""normal people"" it is neither an advantage or disadvantage to be ADHD, and being ADHD may have certain evolutionary or monetary benefits.  Yet it also has some downsides as well though with behavior and/or medication these downsides can be significantly reduced.


-----


I am not quite done, sorry for the long post.  **ADHD is not the only thing that can cause decreases in executive function,** there are other disorders or problems that can cause low executive function.  Depression, Anxiety, Aspergers, Autism, Bi Polar, Schizophrenia, Parkinson, Dementia, Alzheimers and problem dozens more that I am not familiar with.  So if your only way to test someone for ADHD is to watch them you may not have picked up that it is ADHD and not some other problem.


Second the two drugs you are being given are treatments for ADHD but they are also treatments for Depression.  Wellbutrin raises effective levels of **Dopamine**, Cymbalta is an SNRI, a Serotonin and **Norepinephrine** Reuptake Inhibitor; thus Cymbalta increases levels of Serotonin and Norepinephrine.  Low levels of Serotonin, Norepinephrine, and/or Dopamine cause depression (whether you have low levels of 1, 2, or all 3 is different from person to person).  ADHD is caused by low levels of Dopamine and Norepinephrine.  So in effect your doctor was treating you but not necessarily in the most effective way possible.  Now that we know you have ADHD we can ask your doctor to pursue better drugs that can affect those two chemicals you are lacking.


Lastly your Doctor may not have wanted to label you on a theory he may be developing.  He may not have been able to test ADHD so he was watching you gaining more experience about you specifically before he told you his theory.


-----


I understand you are frustrated and angry.  Those are legitimate feelings, especially since how much ADHD can screw you up throughout the years.  I take it you are an adult and this was undiagnosed for at least over a decade or two.


**Almost done, now stuff about me for I think we are similar**


I *understand* I was not truly diagnosed until I was 28 (I was diagnosed earlier at 10 but that diagnosis was rejected and I never knew till I was 28 and treatment was not performed.  I did see one therapist for depression when I was 20 till I was 22.  He never diagnosed me with ADHD and just treated me for depression and suicidal thoughts, I felt better enough with the depression that I stopped seeing him but I still continued to have difficulties in my life due to the ADHD.


Just recently I starting seeing another doctor this time a psychiatrist instead of a psychologist  and he agreed on the first visit that I had depression and anxiety.  Before the second meeting something I read something written by about another ADHD person and what that person said clicked with me and I asked my psych about ADHD on the second visit.  Turns out my psych kinda specializes in ADHD but even he didn't recognize it on the first visit for all my symptoms of depression, anxiety, and poor control of my life *could* be explained by depression and anxiety as well as having a shitty earlier life thus causing trauma and thus making me more susceptible for depression, anxiety, and poor life control.  This was not my second therapist's fault for I didn't explain to him I am a vivid daydreamer and I have poor working memory being distractible and forget things easily.  I always had problems with grammar, editing, and word choice.  I would say the wrong word that starts with one letter and thus sound similar to what I really meant to say, or the wrong word that I use is somehow related to the correct word I was trying to use. I did not tell him; I am very good at being thrifty when I am happy...but when I am unhappy I spend money unwisely due to bad impulse control and I can't make good value judgements about how the purchase will impact my life.  I thus spend money on something I really do not need or I can't use immediately, sure the item may be useful in the far future but maybe it won't be useful at all.  I did not explain to him I have poor ability at prioritizing problems, I can analyze and find out all the possible problems out there but making me prioritize them in order of importance is hard.   Why I didn't do this with the psych and tell him of all my problems.  Well I didn't do it for I just thought this was the way I was, I was just weird and I always had these problems.  Depression and Anxiety were the new things, how I process the universe has always been the same.

"1078","So, my husband and I both have ADHD. Our 6 year old son also has ADHD. He‚Äôs the oldest of 3. Life gets pretty wild here...

My son *is* on meds. He‚Äôs a hot mess without them and the one day I forgot to give them to him on a school day he got sent to the principals office for throwing a chair in class... so... meds are our lord and savior. 

However, since his meds don‚Äôt kick in until basically the time I‚Äôm dropping him off at school, it‚Äôs a constant struggle to get him to get dressed, brush his teeth etc every morning. I say ‚Äúok, time to get dressed!‚Äù Dude goes into his room and comes out naked with a Pok√©mon book, then starts asking me if he can have Girl Scout cookies for breakfast. üôÑ He does finally get dressed, and he does finally eat something that is at least kind of a healthy breakfast, but now he wants to fight with his 4 year old brother about whether Spider-Man can beat the Hulk. 

So I feel your pain on the whole morning chaos. We also have a 3 month old baby, so of course she can come in and absolutely fuck the routine (one morning, we were about to head out the door *early* for once... and she had a major diaper blowout, so then we ended up being 15 minutes late to drop my son off at school). 

One thing I‚Äôll say though- my son responds decently well to timers. Like if I say ‚Äúok, I‚Äôm gonna set a timer for 10 minutes, and when that timer goes off, it‚Äôs gonna be time to brush your teeth‚Äù. He‚Äôs usually pretty good about it.","fhbmp73",1,1581445447,"2020-02-11 18:24:07"

"1095","I have both Aspergers and ADHD. Technically according to the DSM IV, they're mutually exclusive, but the tides may be changing on that.

There is definitely some overlap, but the effects of being on the autistic spectrum go much deeper and in a direction that I don't see covered anywhere in what defines ADHD. I suspect there are a lot of aspies out there with an ADHD diagnosis, especially if they don't *quite* meet the Aspergers criteria... and that's probably okay if they're getting some tools or medication that helps them to be happy and succeed in life. For me, it doesn't really matter what comes from what, but it's helpful for my own sense of understanding to know that I have both.

Maybe we'll find out one day that they're really just different points on the same spectrum, neurologically speaking. It's more art than science in a lot of ways, trying to see if a general ""picture"" fits rather than just a checklist of obvious symptoms.

Anxiety is often present in people on the autistic spectrum... I'd sure say it's anxiety-provoking to be the only one to not get the joke or be stressing out about the vent blowing on your leg :)

Since it's not like there's a pill out there to ""cure"" autism, I'd ask yourself what it really means to you to pursue an autistic spectrum disorder diagnosis. Is it important for your own personal curiosity or sense of identity, or have an impact on how you think you'll manage your symptoms?","c37gjot",4,1323724237,"2011-12-12 21:10:37"
"1096","&gt; Your response made me cry!! Thank you so much for the support. I really needed a life line. Seriously, thank you.

Glad I could be of service. :)

I am so glad Strattera is working for you!! I won‚Äôt let myself google it as I got into a nasty anxiety hole googling adderall lol, so I‚Äôm just walking in with blind fingers crossed. He‚Äôs starting me on an ultra low dose since I seem to be sensitive to meds and we are going to go from there.

First ADHD medication I ever took was Ritalin wayyyy back in the 90's. And it f-ed me up. We tried a few others, including low dose controlled release Ritalin and Catapres. They helped a little bit but not much. Catapres particularly was the worst. I ended up fainting a few times from low blood pressure on that one. Turns out amphetamine stimulants just don't work with me. Strattera was the the first NRI we tried and it has worked like a dream.

Your fear over Googling Stattera is understandable. I do caution however, that you become familiar with the side effects of Stattera so that in the event that you develop those effects, you know what is manageable and what is dangerous. Strattera for me does cause a little bit of dry mouth and has forced me to increase my fiber intake due to constipation.

&gt; I have no heard of Jessica McCabe but will check those out, thank you!! I too have wondered in my moments of optimism if I just haven‚Äôt found the right thing but get down on myself due to my pattern of not following through with anything ever.

She's great and I wish her content was around back when I was a teenager. I happened to learn most of what she has taught the hard way yet even still, she's taught me a few things. I had never thought of having a calm down jar before, and now I am building one soon thanks to her! She's a great resource for ADHD and the neurodiversity community.

YouTube is a great place to learn about ADHD from people who actually have and/or treat ADHD. It's pretty cool if your the type of person who can't focus on the page but can focus on a video.

Speaking of the page though, you should check out ADDitude and CHADD, as they are great resources and can give you different ideas, tactics, and techniques to tackle and manage yourself. :)

&gt; I started out working in retail and moved into animal care. I worked kennels, managed a grooming salon, and then managed a training facility. Animals are the only thing I‚Äôve ever stuck with, but I had a lot of issues that I haven‚Äôt quite worked through yet. I couldn‚Äôt handle the low quality of care in seemingly every facility I ended up in and it eventually wore me down. I had plans to open my own facility, and by plans I mean dreams lol, but a tragedy happened that made me second guess my knowledge of animal care in general. Vague I know, but heavy for random reddit commenting. I haven‚Äôt figured out how to work through it yet though and am not sure how to do that.

&gt; Anyway, I am now an ABA therapist for kids with autism. When I first started I loved it. Now I may be bored? But I also feel guilt for the boredom. This is the first time my family has been proud of me in a job. I feel like if I switch paths again they‚Äôre all just gonna give up. Lately I‚Äôve been on an ‚ÄúI want to become a hairstylist‚Äù kick lolol. Who knows.

The profession that's right for you is at the intersection of what is needed, what you can make money doing, what you are good at, and what keeps you interested. I encourage you to pursue your dreams while cautioning against impulsivity. I recommend that before you make any career changes that you do all the research you can on it, and then mull it over for a month or two. That should give enough time for the impulsivity to die down. If you still want to change at that time, by all means do so! Follow your heart while being mindful of your desires. :)

&gt; Anyway, I am now an ABA therapist for kids with autism. When I first started I loved it.

Dang it now I don't want you to leave your job. XD

We need quality ABA therapists now and will need even more in the future. Your doing a pretty noble thing helping out marginalized kids. Your family is right to be proud of it, and you should be too! :)

But even still, your personal happiness and finding a vocation that suits you is much more important then what the world needs. Mull it over for a while and make a decision a couple months from now.

&gt; The skills you talk about make perfect sense and I guess the goal is to stay optimistic and learn them, which will hopefully be easier when I‚Äôm medicated. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve meant to learn them for 10 years, but I‚Äôll decide to learn them on a Monday night and then forget by Tuesday üòÇ.

&gt; Your story is so incredibly inspiring and I am so happy for you, you sound like you have really kicked some ass and have done amazing for yourself!!! It really does give me hope that someday sooner than later I‚Äôll be achieving goals. At this point I‚Äôll be proud if I can even come up with a plan.

I think it helping a little but time will tell.  Plus after I put the first computer on ebay and it sold. I felt great because I have been fighting with my self for months to do it.

"1137","Yeah, after an incident on Sunday night/Monday morning in which I took my adderall too late in the morning, couldn't sleep, then took it early the next morning before deciding I was too tired to go to work and being unable to fall asleep until later that evening, I've been getting a good 6 or 7 hours a night. It was working fine until Friday when I started noticing I wasn't getting any of the benefits that I was. I used to drink just a ton of energy drinks that have a lot of C in them, but since starting adderall, I haven't been craving the caffeine like at all and haven't been drinking them as much. I still noticed the adderall working when I did drink them.
 
After getting only 2 hours of sleep this morning before kids woke me up, I took it and it's obviously working again. The noise they were making was just destroying my brain until it kicked in, and now I'm fine. I'm about to go do dishes and try to start on homework before my wife gets up and the fight inevitably continues. 
 
I don't know. My my diet hasn't been any different. I don't eat in the morning so absorption or interaction shouldn't have been any different than any other day. I very rarely drink and haven't drank at all since starting medication because I don't want interactions and I want to be able to accurately gauge how it's working. 
 
I've been over several possibilities and I can't settle on anything that would make sense. Really, I wasn't concerned about why it wasn't working so much as I was just hating the reminder that I've been a problem for everyone for 30 years.","gnf41ri",2,1613317022,"2021-02-14 15:37:02"

"1141","I'm not 100% sure but I think it's a combination of things.
I graduated college so I am less stressed, and only have to focus on one thing (work). 
I got a car so I have more control in my life.
I play roller derby and skate multiple times a week. So i exercise and engage my mind a lot more and removes the opportunity to get bored and overthink. Also I have much better friends than I used to. 
Also a bit better of a mindset, I appreciate things a bit more, but that's more of a result of things getting better for me recently.

My advice, first step is to find some form of exercise that really engages your mind. And do it regularly for a while before you decide if you like it or not (and it's not just your adhd telling you, u dont enjoy it.) I think what roller derby/skating hits the marks for me is that; theres an element of danger, my brain is too focused on not falling over to be distracted, and it's a social sport.

"1148","&gt;If you're not a feminist (or not educated about the various -isms) you're not going to find it funny

I am very much a feminist, and I fail to see the humor in anything said there. It's like saying ""if you're not a gamer, you're not going to find /r/gaming funny"" - no way, /r/gaming is shit any way you look at it, and so is /r/ShitRedditSays and the fempire.

I think that differences can and should be highlighted, and that oppression is a nasty thing that we collectively need to address, but SRS doesn't do that, it's fanatically religious about minorities (white cis males are everything wrong with the world, etc.) and even if the satellite subreddits tone it down a bit, they're not any richer in content - it's an echo box for people who *want* to feel oppressed and marginal, rather than a way for non-marginals to meet and learn to accept marginals, or a constructive way for marginals to address oppression. (""hurr durr kick them in the balls"" is not a constructive way to address oppression.)

I'm taking a Bioethics class right now, and it touches a lot about disability. My first reflex was how SRS would have a field day with this, so I posted tentatively: [my Bioethics class is ableist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWorldProblems/comments/11ikrn/my_bioethics_class_is_ableist/)

Note that the questions laid out in my post are very valid questions in the field of healthcare. I only got one response, but it wasn't anything special - still, I feel that it demonstrates well the extremism and disregard for reason that animates SRS:

&gt;Good lord, that's terrible. I'm sorry you have to sit through that. Is there any way you could bring it up with the head of the department? That doesn't seem like legit coursework at all.

Apparently, Bioethics is ""not legit"" :) It's a recurring theme in SRS to think that the politically correct should have precedence over reality.

Lucky me my initial dosages were small and my doctor understanding.

Anyway, pill organizer, for real.  If I forget if I have or have not taken my medication, I just go and look.  

If it isn't there, I took it.  If it is, I need to take it.

Reach out and communicate with your teachers if you feel comfortable enough to do so. As a teacher myself, I promise that a majority of us are extremely understanding of your situation. I usually extend due dates or reach out to you and understand what types of assignments work best for you.

I went through school with ADHD/anxiety myself and can be in your shoes. No matter how hard you want to be productive, your mind controls you and pushes you off that productive path. 

Coffee and ADHD is hard to balance. I recommend that if you must drink coffee then make sure it is dark roast (less caffeine), maybe water it down, or jot down how much you drink and what your tipping point is.

I am a coffee fanatic and used to drink it throughout the day. 4-6 cups light roast on average during college. I eventually discovered that one cup in the morning was perfect for me. Took a while to get past the headaches but it was worth it.

"1208","I understand that you feel like your girlfriend took away part of your agency, when she disclosed private information to people without your consent. She should not have done that - and hopefully she will refrain from doing anything similar in the future.

You are allowed to be annoyed that you lost the ability to decide who should know that you are medicated. Your girlfriend probably didn't think of the massive stigma related to some forms of medication, that makes a lot of people prefer to keep it a private matter.
The positive part of this is perhaps, that this is because she likely does not share these negative opinions about medication - she might even be relieved that you are receiving treatment. It is important that she *understands* how you feel about it, so she knows how to avoid hurting you again. 

I hope that you are able to reconcile with the fact, that some people are now aware of your condition (to some extent). It may affect the way they interact with you, but it could just be temporary. Some might even forget about it sooner than you think.
It can even be relieving, if they have a positive (or just less severe) reaction in the end.

Remember, that you can't regain complete control of the information, just like your girlfriend can't undo the oversharing. You can feel bad about it and (over)think about the possible reactions, but your focus should be on moving forward from the current situation - both in your relationship and with the other people involved.

"1211","Your idea of social/biological co-evolution leading to two differing narratives certainly sounds plausible, and is interesting to think about!

Some musings, if you feel up to engaging with them:

Not feeling violated *is* pretty interesting. I mean, a lot has changed in the last while. Norms surrounding personal rights, monogamy, and the sanctity of the body are much more dynamic (and nuanced at the same time), there's a lot more crossover in (and even a lot of merging of) traditional feminine/masculine roles, and there is a renewed focus on equity across discussions of disadvantaged groups, including women. All of that modifies the context that we're making our assumptions in, which might be another contributor to the conflicting ideas.

Too, the red-flagging of violations you're talking about has also become particularly noticeable and more frequent in a general sense in the last 25-30 years or so, certainly owing to the aforementioned social-stuff-that's-changed, and especially when it relates to women as a disadvantaged group. There is a focus on calling-out violations not just of the body, but of rights, and those abstract rights being treated akin to the body not because they're an exact match, but because there is a recognizance that they could actually lead to bodily harm (see: victim blaming [how's that for a little irony in the thread?]). I'm sure this contributes, as well.

Here's a question to think about: if a woman were in OP's situation, but married to another woman, do you think she'd react much differently to finding the same journal? If downplaying of flirtation is a beneficial social trait for women, we might naively expect that she'd write it off as harmless, unless we consider that the perception of infidelity seems to apply pretty evenly across people. There may simply not have been historical space (as you noted) to do something about it, and norms haven't always been such that we'd have thought about these situations on a broad scale.

(my degree is in sociology [network theory] &amp; biology [physiology], if you want some context for where I'm coming from with these thoughts; apologies if they seem a little disconnected. ADHD, you know. :))","cvpr8m8",1,1444104175,"2015-10-06 04:02:55"

When I had spoken with my doctor about medication to assist with my mental health conditions, she stressed the importance of another form of therapy as crucial for my own healing and healthy coping process.  I started with cognitive behavioral therapy then, and it's helped me learn healthy coping skills which I can use to guide my thought process down a healthier and more positive path. The way she put it was that the medication was able to get me to a standing position, but I needed the therapy to help me learn to walk again. Skill building -- you're spot on with what you said.

It's been a bit rough as my therapist hasn't been as effective in helping me through video visits during the pandemic. I found a safe space in her office where I wasn't worried about interruptions, about crying, and about seeing my family immediately after I open the door to my office again. When I spoke with her about these concerns, her response was ""the pandemic is affecting everyone in different ways.""

For the first time in ever I can see what the black cloud in my head actually is. But for all of this to make any sense and to really bring my point home which is that getting the diagnosis was the best thing to happen to me since birth, I'll have to start at the beginning.

I'll opt for a lil' trigger warning for a few topics before that: There are mentions of domestic abuse, physical violence and self\-harm coming. Better safe than sorry.

Hi, I have always been highly intelligent and I always valued knowledge and the methods we as a race devised to accumulate and verify that delicious stuff. My family, though, not so much. They preferred to reach for sectarian promises for afterlife, rebirth and some other gazpacho bull, not vaccinating their kids, giving homeopathy for measles and all that jazz. And they beat, oppressed and basically gaslighted me for as long as I can recall, the most hurtful aspect being that I never knew what I was being punished for. As a rule of thumb, by the way, of course ADHD didn't exist and Ritalin was just a marketing ploy by evil pharma giants. So no wonder that topic never came up. So let's jump ahead a bit. School and high school took the route we all know. I performed excellently until high school, then barely well enough, then I failed at studying medicine, before failing at law and recently ultimately also failing at a journalism degree, all while working a lot of jobs, ruining a few promising relationships, drinking and smoking a lot and slowly crawling towards journalism \(I did some excellent stuff and I don't really need the diploma to get where I want\), which has proven a godsend, since this is actually important to me and most of the outlets and companies involved are making an insane mess out of all of it and heads like mine are needed to figure out a way out of this heap of rotten compost.. Late\-stage capitalism, I'd guess, but let's all not dwell on that. Let's dwell on me, rather.

While I wish someone had seen something abut my mental dysfunctions and the cyclically recurring nature of my problems and spoken up, since my circle of friends and my siblings aren't idiots, I myself had to find other ways to cope. So I put all of my failures, the self\-hatred, the recurring thoughts of grievous self\-harm, which I knew I'd probably never do but felt to be comforting as an option away in a neat box labeled ""childhood traumas and maybe intelligent people always suffer from existential dread"" and that seemed good enough as an explanation of why I could always be adequately content with my character but not my achievements or lack thereof. But still, while some small moments of happiness always gave me the energy  to trudge on, it eventually had to come to a head. After narrowly escaping a burnout because I was lucky/smart enough to start a shouting match leading to my termination at work, I couldn't sleep for three straight days and I knew I was probably just about due for the insane asylum. And then my GP had the smarts to ask a few seemingly unrelated questions about the time when I was 12. A few minutes later I emerged from the office in a different state. It took half a year before I got the definite diagnosis and the following two moments, when certainty kicked in that pretty much none of my life troubles were actually causally my fault and one day later, when the first low dose of meds kicked in and my days basically doubled in length, it was not only two boulders rolling down from me, but an unstoppable wave of hope that my life could still go down the drain but then it would have been my choice. I have gained agency and I have through that, for the first time since I was 12 or so found myself silently or loudly crying, laughing, wanting \(and doing it\) to kick the lard out of my body, eating healthily, flirting, seeing a chance of my current relationship getting not better but to new and exciting places and IT IS JUST ALL SO GODDAMN EASY. This text here up to now has taken me about 10 minutes max to whip up. So I don't feel like I've been made whole or given a chance with the diagnosis. I even laugh at the prospect of being stigmatized. Because I now have superpowers. While this might sound like a deranged and ego\-boosting thing to write, I'd like to elaborate this a bit.

As I understand it and like to ""illustrate"" with words, a brain on ADHD is starved for the inputs it absolutely needs to keep working and so needs to branch out and take everything in, mostly subconsciously. The bigger roar and pull of the associative stream of consciousness does then always inconvenience the conscious thought process which would like to get somewhere but usually feels like a carriage with 8 horses that are not only temperamental, but extremely non\-behaving and usually need to be forced back on track all the time. Which is incredibly tiring if one's surroundings are not taiored to one's special needs. But this turns out to be a strength. While most of us with ADHD have at one point or other experienced self\-hatred because of our perceived lack of discipline and willpower, it's actually the opposite. While our habits may be bad and need time to change, the iron grip we have had to develop on our conscious train of thought proves to be an absolute asset after the meds level the playing field with all dem normies with dem normie brains. While I'm aware that I like to use very clear, bordering on crass language, the point I'm trying to illustrate is just this: I was afraid of what this journey down the rabbit hole of mental illnesses could bring. And I'm still amazed that it turned out to be not only not a negative thing but the best thing since that one time I first left my home country for a few month t explore greece and found myself to experience a certain peace in my brain. I think you all know what I'm talking about.","dywl7zp",1,1526212652,"2018-05-13 11:57:32"

"1261","I think retention may be a good choice then. Personally, I‚Äôve never met a parent that did it and said ‚Äúthat was a bad choice!‚Äù  

As far as tutoring we chose a *very specific* tutor. She attends a reading clinic run by speech pathologists. It uses the Lindamood Bell instruction. It was suggested by her evaluating psychologist. You can likely find a school or program in your area by googling the program. 

I‚Äôll be honest it‚Äôs expensive at $85/hour and she goes twice a week over summer. Then once a week when school resumes and/or she is on grade level. However, the good news is our insurance covers a portion of services because it is billed as speech therapy *not* tutoring. The longer you wait for tutoring the longer/more difficult catching up will be IMO. 

Another ‚Äúbonus‚Äù is covid.

Many centers promote teachers based on credentials and performance. So, TEFL (teaching English as a foreign language) is becoming a viable career field for those willing to invest in it (either with a CELTA certification or a Master's), and simply sticking around for several years. 

Teaching very young learners involves lots of movement, energy, and creativity as one must figure out how to keep them engaged for an entire class. I enjoy it-- total adrenaline rush. I've tried desk jobs and the digital nomad life : both disasters in my case.

"1349","Since you are under 26 you have several options.

* You can get health insurance through your parents until the age of 26.  If they have health insurance they can add you to their plan just like they can add a baby or a teenager.

* Anybody over the age of 18 can get a health care plan for 2015 starting Nov 15, 2014 via healthcare.gov  For your age group a monthly rate for said health care plan will be in the $200 to $300 area.

* Anybody over the age of 18 and makes less than $46,500 a year will get a subsidy towards that health insurance from healthcare.gov.  It is based on a sliding scale.  Do not be surprised if the your income qualifies you for an 80 to 90% subsidy so your health care plan is something like $25 dollars a month.

* If your income is below a certain amount per year, you may instead qualify for Medicaid and get free basic health care from the government.  Even if you are only 20.

You need to look into this for you only have the month of Nov and Dec to decide to sign up for 2015.  Then you have to wait another 12 months for the next Nov and Dec period.

Go to this website and find out your options https://www.healthcare.gov/get-coverage/

None of us are perfect,  but when someone sees that I get super overwhelmed cleaning up while I cook, and pick up after dinner (even though I made kickass stuffed porkchops, and mother freaking amazing twice baked potatoes- because I know I'm a good cook) it detracts from my meal, I can't think like a normal person, I'm embarrassed, have anxiety, and just want to shut everyone out of the kitchen.  

I don't judge. I am there for their ""failures"" in life because to me, I can see things differently and generally Its not an area I suck at.  Lol  I can amazingly even help someone else get organized,  teach them to cook meals, show them how to pick up their kitchen when cooking (because its not left to me- they can do what I tell them to do).

"1415","Hello there\~\~\~

I really, really appreciate you bringing up RSD because it's a highly overlooked aspect of both ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (which is very similar to both ADHD and Bi-Polar and Highly Sensitive Person HSP). To me it 'feels' like RSD is a twisted formation of mirror neurons in which our amygdalas chatter with mirror neurons to determine how someone is perceiving us in any given moment.  

However, this can be very favorably in scenario where being meek, timid, humble, patient, kind, gentle, and tender are positive attributes. RSD seems to employ all of those traits. Just one exampl,e the Christian Bible writes about how those traits make their 'owner' worthy of 'inheriting the Earth' in a sort of post-rapture scenario . And other cultures also favor these traits as well. 

So RSD is a root condition with many subservant complementary-aspects.  I do not believe RSD is a condition in itself but a composite condition comprised of complementary conditions. However, until we (teh huemanz) can unlock a more detail brain mapping. we will not know. ","egbsoz8",1,1550000235,"2019-02-12 19:37:15"

"1434","Well, I think I may have figured out a way of taking in verbal instructions and stuff like that: 

I'm actually pretty good at following complex instructions, but I have difficulty *taking them in* when I first hear them. So even if I could understand the process, if I don't have all the information there, mistakes can happen and things can get missed. So if someone gives you a set of instructions, repeat them back to the person as you think you heard them and allow them to correct you if you misunderstood something. Repeating it back also helps you understand and retain the information better. 

Make sure you write it down and don't be afraid to ask questions. I have trouble with distinguishing relevant information from irrelevant information and end up trying to take in everything and that just ends up with me forgetting the stuff that's actually important because I'm basically taking in everything verbatim and it's too much for me to process. So I guess practice only focussing on the relevant information. 

Say you're taking a phone call, it might help to have like a cheat sheet where you've got all the information you're expecting to give/receive and you can check off what's been covered and easily *see* the gaps. Sometimes I get off the phone and I'm like damn, I didn't even get their name, but if you have that sheet and you look at it and you can clearly see that you didn't get their name right in front of you then you're not going to have that problem. 

For example, you're taking a call, you pull out your template and it looks something like this

Their name (and the correct spelling):

Where they're calling from:

Who they're calling to speak to:

Their contact details:

What they're calling about:


So you fill that in as the call goes a long, you can start to see what information you have or don't have so you'll never hang up the phone without having it all there. And to reinforce information in your memory and make sure it's correct, repeat it back to them - it's called active listening, you've probably heard of it before - not only will it help you retain information but it's going to help you build rapport with the person you're talking to.


I went off on a tangent there talking a lot about phone calls because that's something that I have to deal with in my job and it's something I struggle with. I pick up the phone and people start talking and immediately I begin to miss a lot of information or forget it because it's so much to take in and my mind is in on other things, and I'm trying to prioritise a billion different things at once. You can apply the same method to pretty much anything, like if you're writing an essay, it helps to have an outline so you know what topics you're covering, shopping lists so you don't forget important items, to-do lists. Outline everything so you can easily see what's needs to be included. It helps to visually see the gaps rather than rely on remembering it. Because when I try to rely on my own memory, my brain is like 'Huh? Missing information? I don't know anything about any missing information' and it's only until someone else asks me a question about it that I'm like 'Oh, I didn't get that.' The outlines give you the questions - the prompts to remind you what information you need to work with and also - and this is important - what's *relevant* information. 

Hope that helps. Just like not everyone can perform arithemetic of a certain level of complexity in their heads, we can't rely on our brains to tell us what's important right now and what information we do or don't have to complete a task.

We can use tools to aid us with that and we shouldn't be afraid to just because we feel like we shouldn't need them or that other people don't have to. We need to know that to be successful, we might have to put in that extra amount of effort or have extra support, but we can't just write ourselves off as useless. 

With practice you can get better if you instill certain habits, but yes, it is generally going to be harder for us but it doesn't necessarily mean we're *doomed*. I do believe we can be as good, perhaps even better than others if we just take the right approach to things. Although, I should be doing something else right now but I'm writing all this. Is this too long for a reddit comment? I hope you were able to find some value in it.

"1440","OH!  Man, I have a ton of this shit. 

So you know, I am really, really not a crafty person either. My girlfriends are all about the knitting and crafts and stuff like that. Yeah. Not me. My basic strategy is to take ideas from other people and, if I can't, say, print them directly off my computer or outsource them altogether, I modify them slightly and then use them.  No worries.  

In addition to the using the strategy songs, expectation management, etc. that we got from television shows, one thing that we did starting then and continue to do now (and that I do for myself!) is the use of **lists and routines:**  

EXAMPLE:   
WHAT:  upon coming home from school, the routine we have established for my sons (6 and 4) is as follows:  
1.  hang up backpack and jacket on the boy-level hooks on the back of the coat closet door   
2.  take of shoes and put them in the shoe basket   
3.  put lunchbox and water bottle on kitchen counter   
4.  put any homework/school stuff in mummy's inbox on the dining room table   

(so you know I wasn't lying about that whole non-creative thing, [here](http://justorganizeyourstuff.com/joys/filing-system-how-to/containerize/265-organizing-kids-papers-and-stuff#.VC8YLr7jNFI) is where I got that particular idea from.)

HOW:  
I edited and printed out the list and posted it at the door.  I explained about making the list. When we are on our way home, I remind them about checking their list when we get there.  I made my own routine and articulate the steps to them out loud as I do them so they see my example.  I thank them for following their list, and if they don't do it for whatever reason, I remind them and/or do it for them.  

WHY:   
Making checklists is an invaluable tool for us ADDers. We basically need to do it our entire lives.  It is a great habit to get into now, and a great tool to place into their toolbox that they will hopefully pull out later on on their own.  Also, putting things in the same place time after time helps us to be able to find them again later - something we would otherwise struggle to do!  Plus, this fosters a level of independence that my boy might otherwise not have on his own.  All this stuff is good for us.  

We also had/have checklists posted or made someplace for daily homework, getting ready in the morning, and even going to the bathroom (stolen from Daniel Tiger's strategy song, again. I just printed out pictures from the show with the lyrics.)  We have routines and little rituals for afternoon tea, meals, and bedtime.  

Start by codifying the things you do already. Make checklists from there and tweak as necessary.  This really makes a difference for us. We know just what needs to be done and when to do it. It reduces resistance, and reduces mess-ups too.  ","ckzqua2",1,1412373509,"2014-10-03 21:58:29"

"1463","I've by no means ""made it"" in terms of fully managing my ADD and my time. (i'd consider myself there maybe when &gt;90% of my time is going towards things that related to my core values)I do feel like I've made a bunch of progress and am ""on my way there""

two books make a big difference for me:

1. Getting Things Done by David Allen
2. ""The Power of Habit"" by Charles Duhigg

GTD is about having ""relaxed control"" over your life by making sure you have a functional flexible system in place that you manage with ongoing ""maintenance"" habits.  Concepts like an ""Inbox"" and a ""tickler file"" are really invaluable tools.As a person with ADD/ADD-Pi you have lower working memory, which means you NEED to externalize your thoughts and tasks more than most people - WAY more than most people. I am constantly writing down what I'm doing as im doing it.   
When I'm programming, I have notes open to almost ""narrate my thought process to my future self"" - this not only helps me pick up my work again in the future - it actually MAKES ME FASTER in the now - since I can easily overflow my working memory and loose track of what I'm doing. That happens alot less now that I take detailed notes all the time.

""The Power of Habit"" is a great book, in that it goes over what a habit is: a program in your brain that runs automatically. True habits don't require willpower (most of the time) and you can hack/program your brain to have the habits you want. It took me alot of time, but I can now consistently get up at 5am and get to the gym 6 days a week.I pack my gym bag the night before (so there are no logistics to trip me up before i head out the door). Then, in the morning I give myself a ""reward"" of a caffeine shake, a little protein bar, and about 30 min on my computer AFTER I get my but out of bed and to the gym (yeah I'm the weirdo on my laptop in the gym lobby - sue me). Then, when those 30 min are up - I'm caffeinated, in my gym clothes, and at the gym with all my stuff. Its pretty easy to get going with my workout at that point (since I'm already 90% there).To maintain my GTD system - I have similar triggers and rewards to get myself to do what I need to (I also try not to make my system to heavyweight - since that is inviting failure)

In terms of how much time and/or money to spend on different areas of your life, that is really dependent on what is right for you - but if you ask me, MEASURE EVERYTHING and REVIEW PERIODICALLY. Use Rescuetime, Mint/Tiller, etc. Then, every week or so (maybe as part of your GTD weekly review ;) ), look over where your time/money went, and decide if the things you spent your time on aligned with your values. If they didn't - come up with a plan. If they did, great! But still ask yourself if there is a ""third option"" where you could have served your values without spending as much.

This was mostly a poorly formatted wall of text since I'm not wanting to spend alot of time on this brain dump - but hopefully it helps!","e7aot69",1,1538862138,"2018-10-06 21:42:18"
"1464","Yes that is me to a T!!!!! It was always just like my quirk among friends coworkers and family, and I've noticed it's really pissed off my mom and sister in the past.

"1465","I'd say so. Fear of failing to meet deadlines resulting in low grades was my #1 motivator. Yes, I often wanted to learn the material, but the fear of not doing well is what forced me to get what I needed to do, done on time (usually). There were slip-ups, of course.

I wanted to do well in school and I did, so it's not like I was always in fear/anxiety. But those were definitely a big part of it too.

When school was getting busy, it definitely got really bad at times. Every semester would have a time period I would call ""the mid semester meltdown"" where there was so much to do in so little time. I would be pulling late hours and stressed out that I eventually became numb to it and would just plow through everything. Oddly enough, when overloaded, avoiding doing some tasks made me very motivated to do other ones I normally would procrastinate on. Even my roommate would say that because of this he often gets more done when he has a ton to do rather than it being more spread out.","dg29vaf",2,1491803317,"2017-04-10 05:48:37"
"1466","I will share my views here.

No, I don't think of ADHD as a gift. It has definitely given me unique challenges in my life.

But you know what? Because of how I have been shamed, treated with prejudice, and seen as an outsider at different points in my life, I realised how flawed society is. Yes, I face challenge in life because of my ADHD, but these challenge I have shaped have given me a unique perspective in life where I can see past the biases of society.

I was sent to a school in Asia with a really rigid teaching system. Yes, the education system tells you that they value intelligence and creativity, but I have learned the hard way that they don't. I was often bored in class and I sometimes got creative such as drawing something which I was told not to draw during art class as I thought my idea was more creative. The teachers singled me out and shamed me. There were also numerous conflicts and my teachers didn't like how I thought class was boring and mucked around. They labeled me as potentially ""ADHD"", ""autistic"", and ""retarded"". My peers didn't like me and also shamed me in a similar manner.

So I had my IQ tested and it turns out that I am gifted. The teachers stopped shaming me but they still subtly disliked me. At the end, I transfered to another school and I was much happier. I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until adulthood.

I sometimes think about my experiences there. I didn't do anything harmful. I just didn't listen to my teacher as their ideas weren't always right and I didn't harm anyone but they singled me out and shamed me. From a very young age, I realised this is what every societal norm is. The group in power tells you that they value intelligence, hard work, creativity as well as other positive traits so that you can effectively work for them and this ultimately benefits them. However, if you are clever enough to see how the group in power is trying to groom you into their workers, they will shame you as they don't want you to rebel against them, and they will keep on shaming you until you give up in a learned helplessness manner as they want to maintain their power and don't want anyone exposing what the system is really like.

I am now an adult and was eventually diagnosed with ADHD. I was mildly depressed but before that I was academically successful and I am starting to feel better these days. Yes, ADHD makes me procrastinate and become distracted, but in the meantime, the very fact that society attached the label of a ""loser"" to me made me even more determined to succeed and even surpass them to prove them wrong. Just because I refused to be groomed into the robot society wanted, they decided to shame me. The desire to prove them wrong made me work harder than ever, and I love it when I get the last laugh when I get awards as I know that I have won the competition and proved those who have attached a label to me wrong.

Now that I am an adult I discovered what is called a [""informal means of social control""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_control) in society in the field of sociology. They are basically the social norms we take for granted but they are rules imposed to prevent others from gaining social mobility. So yes, society sells you different ideas such as the American dream and that status and materialism is good to motivate you to work hard which ultimately benefits those on top. But when you reach the level where you are able to deduce that all these societal norms are shaped by those in power and hence all of them are biased, they will shame you for that as they don't want you exposing what is truly going on. They tell you that creativity is a good thing and I did things in my own creative way, but nobody appreciated that and only shamed me for my actions.

Would I take a pill to get rid of my ADHD if I could? Probably not. It gave me a unique upbringing experience where I learned to see past the biases of society and I hence learned to think for myself. Yes, my actions don't always conform to the norm and pushing myself really hard made me miserable at times, but in some way I am glad that I am aware of societal biases. In some ways, it makes me sad that others cannot see past the bias. They are happy to be spoonfed with homework every day under the strict Asian education system and most of them don't even question why this is happening. The capitalist society then tells them that money and status matter the most in life so they grow up chasing these things and joining the rat race. In my area, working for long hours, choosing careers based on status, and marrying for status is very common and very few will question whether this societal norm is flawed.

What am I doing with my life? I try to achieve happiness by being a lifelong learner. I think knowledge is important so that you can see past societal biases and learn to think for yourself. Despite having a disorder, the experiences resulted from it made me more individualist. I honestly think that I would be a very different person if I didn't have ADHD, not because I will probably succeed even more academically but because I will probably just take in societal norms without challenging them and become the robot that society wants to groom me into. I will probably just become another person in the rat race who is obsessed with status and materialism and lose my individuality because of that. Sometimes I see threads such as [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/1y8bvz/dont_study_sociology_if_you_want_to_be_happy/) and I am glad I figured it all out since I was young so that I am prepared to deal with it and learn how to survive in such societal conditions.","dgoi8xq",3,1493037914,"2017-04-24 12:45:14"

It might be a worthwhile idea to contact the pharmacy/doctor and tell them you suspect someone has been tampering with your meds and ask them to compare what you have to what they have. They might be able to help. They might refer you to the police as well.

I'd also lock your meds away and consider getting one of those hidden camera things to monitor your med bottle (or just keep it on you at all times).

This is actually very common too. Normally when people start a new med, or have even been on them for a long time, they build up a tolerance. Very rarely can people wait until their next appointment to get a new script, so they generally talk to the dr that prescribed it, and if the dr approves it, they'll send over a new script with the new dosing. 
I'd be surprised if your new doctor lowered your dose, unless there was concern other than the dosing itself. Just simply tell them that you're taking Xmg X times a day, and that you recently increased. They'll probably write the script for you just like that, and you're golden!

I understand that they are readily available, we've all gotta pay the bills, but to feel you have to keep doing this, or somehow not have those detriments which affect performance at them...well that's just not possible and will only serve to ruin your mental health and self-esteem, which really will kill your prospects (I know, that happened to me and I've worked hard for years to build back some trust in myself and my capabilities, and even now I still struggle with it). The skills you are good at are amazing skills to have, and if you can get yourself  into a position to build them up, well with how our minds work any job requirements present in such positions which don't play to out strengths will be seen as minor issues in your overall performance. Clearly when using your skills you can succeed, as you convinced your superiors to keep you as a commander and in your position because the ultimate value you brought was worth more than your flaws. Our culture suffers under the fantasy that all issues can be conquered, that all personal hard points can be mastered if only you ""work hard enough."" Well that's patently false. Do keep working on methods which your brain can use, and I mean can, to work through or around certain common expectations you struggle with. For me I have to write everything important down, and on some days I have to ask others for important takeaways because my brain just isn't doing it that day. This is not a failure, this is being smart about how you work, and playing to your strengths while minimizing your weaknesses, or completely delegating them away. You may love being waitstaff, but that skillset may not be for you, unless you can write things down, create some kind of table/order priorities as you go  and what not. How would you like to use your assets? What are some of your dream jobs? What is keeping you from getting to them? Who in your life can be a support for you, or to help you learn and grow? I left a job I liked and was doing ok at, because half of it relied on my worst skills and attributes. I just couldn't do it anymore, as it was wearing me down and killing my soul for my work. Eventually you have to say ""My health, my wellbeing, is the most important thing I can give myself, and this just isn't working. I need to be somewhere I can use my strengths and delegate or get help for the rest."" You are an amazing, capable person. Don't let others tell you otherwise.

3. Do you tell people that feel like killing themselves that they are really just misdiagnosing themselves with depression intentionally? Do you tell people with schizophrenia that they are really just using a label in order to excuse themselves from seeing and hearing things that aren't there? Do you tell people with OCD to not take their meds because they should just stop washing their hands until they bleed?  Also, refer to the glasses metaphor. People don't tell those with bad vision to squint harder. They recommend glasses.

Aside from legal repercussions, it also poses quite a few potential health risks. It can increase bp and heart rate and cause circulation issues or heart attacks. It also can cause a lot of psychological issues. If your friend with aspergers is on other medications it can negatively interact with them. Even if he's not it can cause increased anxiety, panic attacks, hallucinations, or paranoia, not to mention potential addiction issues. 

What's worse is that the dose you're on is pretty high, so it's more likely to contribute to some of these negative side effects.

"1547","Thank you for sharing this.

I'd like to point out that OP is pretty clear this is their own experience they are sharing and not a denunciation of medicine.

Can we all allow a person to share from their experience without insisting they pad it with enough clauses for exemptions to frustrate a seasoned attorney reviewing a contract? Would any of us even read a post weighed down like that?

Frankly even if OP stated aggressively ""don't take medicine you can can do a 3.08 GPA without it if you would just use mind power"" that would still be ok. Individuals reading a social forum have to take responsibility to not view any poster as an authority. ADHD in no way discharges that responsibility.

I have been taking adderall for a few months. In many ways it has been a game changer but lately I am often fixated on a nearly inescapable inner monologue which has a maddening tendency to become an external monologue later in the day. This has had real consequences but I don't see it as it is happening. Boy do I replay those monologues in hindsight!

Medication has improved me socially in some ways.  I see more in the moment connection opportunities. I remember to send birthday cards.  I put potential social events on the calendar and remember to attend. But the impact of that inner (occassionally leaking) outer monologue on how I behave in social situations is crazy.  I don't robot but I do get apologetic and over analytical and unnatural.  If this goes on long enough I can see myself turning into a 'robot' in self defense.

For me I have tried only adderall and I am seeking a better professional to evaluate options.  Seems you have done that. I appreciate you sharing you experience OP because it resonates with me and encourages me to take it seriously.

I am interested in what some of your post medicine strategies to use the power your mind have been.  Don't worry though. Any decisions I make are going to be my own.

"1552","You could try taking the Adderall without food in the morning and reduce the amount of carbs consumed throughout the day. You should feel its effects more strongly and not feel the need to up the dose. 
According to self-reports and other peer reviewed research, carb intake interfeers with the absorption of the medication and therefore what is available in striatum in the brain. 
A few posters have noted that the Ketogenic diet has worked wonders for them and this seems valid. It is unclear whether or not it is the fats on the Ketogenic diet that aids in the absorption of the medication or if success is due to the reduced intake of carbohydrates. Imho opinion, I think the lack of carbohydrates does it.

"1557","Here is my system, there are many like it but this one is mine (for the sake of ease, I'll concentrate on the bedroom): 

1.  All clothes are collected and washing is started.  Washing takes the longest (roughly 1.5 hours per load (include drying time)) so it makes sense to let clothes go through that while I'm doing other things.  This also makes the room instantly look cleaner if you have them on the floor. 

2. Dirty dishes are dealt with. 

3. My bed is made.  Again, it makes the room look cleaner already.

4. Everything is picked up off the floor (that doesn't belong there) and placed either on the bed or desk or dresser or whatever. 

5. I then vacuum.  It prevents me from putting things back on the ground.

6.  I put things I picked up in the right place. 

7.  I dust/wipe everything. 



If you feel overwhelmed, do the easier things first.  Getting laundry going is really simple and makes a difference as does making the bed.  This gets your motivation going and makes doing the other things easier.

2 weeks is a very short time, it took me about a year to understand what the medication does and does not do. And in my case at least, there is still a lot of ADHD left, even now I have found a good dosage and take my meds every day. 

ADHD is so so much more than just the inability to focus. 

Also remember that ADHD very probably has prevented you for learning the skills needed to do the things you are trying to do. You will also need to learn these skills, and that's always going to take time.

&gt; I get slightly more done than before, since I did nothing before

as pointless as it might seem now, just focus on the progress you are making. There is nothing else to do.

Day dreaming is not called ADHD. Inability to work on a single ""boring"" task for 5 minutes straight to *save your life* is.

A big problem, in my opinion, is *there are a lot of aggressive over-diagnoses* of ADHD. I don't believe for a moment that everyone who has been diagnosed--sorry rest of the sub, this probably means some of you, too--actually has the disorder. The drugs for ADHD are also performance-enhancing for people without disorders, so they are sought after by anybody who thinks they can get them. And overbearing helicopter parents that will not settle for anything but valedictorian National Merit Scholar, see B's as a ""disorder"" that needs medication.

It pisses me off because it makes it harder for people who *actually have a disorder* to get recognized as such, both by family and peers, and even by doctors and pharmacists. When I say I'm diagnosed with ADD and looking for a prescription, I get a lot of side-eye, like ... yeah right, you look normal to me. It's not until I describe in detail my history, the professional diagnoses I've been given, and the fact that I'm kind of freaking terrified of the meds, but I'm at a point where things are broken and I am ready to try something to fix it, and ... somewhere in there I think people start to get the idea that hey, maybe I'm just an unfortunate person with a disorder and not a criminal or junkie.

It also like ... I don't even think I necessarily agree that either ""attention deficit"" or ""disorder"" are the best way to describe it. When something has me ""on"" I have the exact opposite of either a disorder or a deficit of attention; it feels almost like a superhuman extra awareness of the information that is streaming at me, a tremendous knack for filtering out the relevant and ignoring the inconsequential. (This is not on meds except I've noticed that a BIG jump of caffeine, like 5-6 servings of caffeinated beverage will switch me into a more-focused mode).

I haven't really told many people either. When it comes up I tend to treat it like a personality quirk. ""This is something I've noticed I have a tendency to do, and these are some strategies I use to mitigate that..."" People who don't understand or are just going to judge, not much point in starting a fight with them in my opinion. People who *will* understand, will probably pick up on your coded ""personality quirks"" and let you know that they understand. At least that's what my guess would be... so far only therapists have red-flagged my description of things as ADHD, but it's been very consistently so.","d4bhdtm",2,1466080078,"2016-06-16 12:27:58"

I have several things I use in conjunction to remember important appointments, a dry erase calendar on my wall, a small written calendar I can carry, and my phone. Missed appointments happen, but after the first time I'm embarrassed and it makes me buckle down and ensure it doesn't happen again. I would never get mad at the staff at my office for not reminding me, rather while I have it on my mind I would make sure there's no way I could forget it, down to putting sticky notes on my door or in my car. Then again, my doctor's office will drop a patient after 2 missed appointments. Not consecutively, but ever. It's a good motivator. 

Now, this seems obvious to us but maybe OP needs to develop better coping mechanisms. When you've been under your parents' roof your whole life it's easy to use *them* as a coping strategy. But OP isn't helpless and needs to do whatever it takes to make this appointment happen, on their own, without just expecting their parents or the office staff to do it for them.

"1615","Wow, you've come a long ways from being that quiet kid in class. That sounds awesome!! Just don't forget your seatbelt.

I have the same lack of control around food, but an unfortunately slow metabolism. I'm not even that hungry very often, I just want the stimuli from the taste and texture. I want to be a foodie just to have a good excuse to eat.

Before I learned how to drive, I used to be scared that I would just plain suck and be too scared to speed. Once I got in the car, I turned out to be an ok driver, but had a problem with speeding ahaha. I'm not currently driving, and I honestly don't trust myself behind the wheel until I can get my distractibility under control. 

I've seen the same impatience on the road in my parents (and I'm quite sure that my mom has ADHD, whose tiny car only serves to help her speed around the slow cars)!

!!! I'm still in my twenties and drag my feet through my birthdays. I used to (can I still say I have it if I'm already grown up) have a peter pan complex in that I never wanted to be an adult. It always baffled me that kids were so impatient about growing up. I was pretty mature as a kid, too. While my perspectives/beliefs have changed, I don't feel I've grown any more or less mature. Most of my friends seem to have grown more mellow and professional, but I'm still so easily impressed and enthused (yay ADHD). I think I've had trouble making friends in the recent years because I come on too strongly because of my enthusiasm and expect the same level of casualness and familiarity in return. Guess it only works so well in grade school.

I was the typical day-dreamer.  Always had my head in the clouds.  I was smart but I just wasn‚Äôt very attentive and as such school was a bit hard for me but not so hard that it made anyone concerned (I got As, Bs, and Cs).  I graduated from high school with a 3.1 and then college with a 3.0 (although my degree gpa was 2.75).  I intended to go to law school but could not concentrate to take the LSAT and so I just stopped and worked either desk jobs or in hospitality. 

My parents took my distraction as being disrespectful and careless.  

I‚Äôve dealt with anxiety for pretty much my entire adolescence and adult life.  I was put on Zoloft when I was 28 which helped take the edge off but still it felt like I was slogging through quicksand.

The straw that broke the camels back was having two kids in two years.  I just could not keep up and this led to more anxiety, depression, and anger but I just didn‚Äôt know what to do.  I thought this was just life.  

Fast forward to my oldest being diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 8.  I also started seeing a therapist at this time to deal with my own issues.  During a session I was talking about how my oldest reminded me of myself at that age.  Spacey, and hard to get to concentrate on a task.  After i said this it was like it just clicked in my head that maybe this was my issue too.  So I made an appointment with a neuropsychiatrist and I was formally diagnosed in 30 minutes.  I‚Äôm now on a higher dose of Zoloft and Adderall XR and life is soooo much easier.  I don‚Äôt feel that constant anxiousness and I can now concentrate on my tasks.   I‚Äôm even going to take the LSAT this fall to see if I can get into law school. Better late than never I suppose.

"1642","Let me start broadly and then go more specific.  3 Parts and then Conclusion


&amp;nbsp;

Part 1:  **Basal Ganglia**

There is a brain part called the Basal Ganglia.  It is located in the center of the brain right above the thalamus and the brain stem and it connects multiple brain regions together, including the frontal lobe, the sensory areas, and the emotional areas.  This part of the brain purpose is to be a task switcher, to choose, to action select, and to inhibit.  In effect this part of the brain gets multiple inputs, multiple things your brain needs to decide upon and then specific parts of your basal ganglia choose which of those things you should do enhancing or diminishing the importance of these multiple thoughts, and eventually the basal ganglia allows one of these thoughts to take control and activate your motor areas of your brain and then these motor areas send thoughts down your brain to your spinal chord and then to the nerves and muscles.

The Basal Ganglia is one of the many parts that do not work correctly with ADHD, it is not the only part that can have problems with ADHD, almost always ADHD people have problems with not just one brain region but multiple brain regions (frontal lobe, basal ganglia, and the cerebellum).  That said some ADHD cases have certain brain parts be more ""dysfunctional"" than normal, I do not want to say this word in a negative fashion but these brain regions may be ""broken"" or ""abnormal""

Now Basal Ganglia problems are not limited to just ADHD, other disorders  can involve the Basal Ganglia including Anxiety Disorders, OCD disorders, Tics, Tourettes, Stutters, Parkinson's, Huntington's Chorea, and I am going to stop for I do not want to list 20+ disorders.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Part 2:  **OCD** *spectrum* **disorders**

Now some doctors and scientists believe in a category called OCD **spectrum** disorders.  Now when I say spectrum I am not referring to OCD.  **Understand this is not OCD.**  When they say OCD spectrum disorders, they are referring to a pattern of symptoms which they believe have a common neurobiological link and you can have **different presentation** of these problems.  So in one person with an OCD spectrum disorder this may manifest as OCD such as washing your hands, on another person this may manifest as anorexia nervosa where a person knows they are not fat but they still feel the need to diet and even when they look at a picture analytically they do not see a girl with this figure to be fat, but as soon as you put there face on that girl then suddenly they are fat.  Other OCD spectrum disorders include tics and tourettes.  OCD spectrum disorders can also include things such as Trichotillomania (hair pulling), Onychophagia (nail biting), Dermatillomania (skin picking).

Now some people believe that even things such as Aspergers/Autism should be put under OCD spectrum disorders, that the repetitive movements, mannerisms, are unconscious compulsions the body does due to underlying brain anatomy.

Now not everyone agrees OCD spectrum disorders exist, or if they exist they think it should be defined narrowly or broadly.  Now when I say these people do not think it exists, they do not disagree that these underlying problems such as Tics, OCD, Bulimia, Autism, etc exist they just do not believe there is an underlying connection, or if there is a connection you are drawing connections and patterns that do not really exist.   Thus OCD spectrum disorders should be limited to a more narrow band of terms/disorders, or should not even exist since the science is not yet definitive and all you have is a theory.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Part 3: OCD and Tics and Tourettes

That said we do know for a fact that there is common genetics between OCD and Tics.  And we know for a fact there is a family history where if you have one you are likely to find the others in your genetic family.

OCD and Tics/Tourettes are far closer to each other than other disorders.

We also know that someone's Tics have different causes.  On some people the Tics are anxiety induced, **in some people they are not.**  This may explain the paradoxical nature of ADHD people who also have tics and when they are put on stimulants.  1/3rd of the people the tics go away and disappear or they are greatly reduced, 1/3rd they get worse due to greater increases in anxiety caused by the stimulants, 1/3rd there is no obvious change in the level, intensity, or frequency of the tics.

In some people being put on an SSRI or SNRI helps with the tics and OCD.  The increased serotonin helps the brain be able to task switch better.  This is because the emotional areas of the brain partly control the basal ganglia.

On other people an alpha 2 agonist (which is also an ADHD drug) such as Intuniv helps the frontal lobe better control the basal ganglia and thus stops the tics.

Now Strattera and the Stimulants in the people who do not see increases in Tics work in the same exact way but with a slightly different method (higher frontal lobe activity controlling the basal ganglia)

In some people you need an antipsychotic such as Haloperidol.  Many antipsychotics such as Haloperidol actually block a specific type of dopamine receptor.  Not all dopamine receptors but a specific one in the basal ganglia.  This allows the brain to better exercise control instead of having part of your brain being hyperactive in triggering the basal ganglia and the rest of the brain is not able to counter-regulate it.

Same thing with OCD, sometimes SSRIs help, sometimes only cognitive behavioral therapy helps.  You have to know what is acting wrong with the Basal Ganglia and is causing the OCD for the problem wrong may be different in different people.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**In Conclusion**, a pattern of rumination and the inability to shift your focus away from the stressful event is often a common pattern in ADHD patients, but also other conditions such as OCD, Anxiety, and Autism/Aspergers.  Now this does not mean you have 2 or more conditions, you may or you may not.

But often people have genetic and environmental risks factors where they may show some symptoms of these other disorders even if they do not have the entire pattern of symptoms to meet the criteria of the disorder.  These disorders are spectrum disorders, and humanity is some varied and unique in how it presents.

Think of it like this each of those disorders as a color.  Very bright Blue, bright Red, strong Yellow, pungent Green, etc.  Everyone has a little blue, a little red, a little yellow in them.  Only some people have enough blue or red that we describe them to be in that ""cluster"" of symptoms, to have their behavior to be describe as following that presentation.

&amp;nbsp;

So in sum please talk this over with your doctor.  **Do not self diagnosis,** but instead state sometimes I think my behavior is **similar** to this condition, is this something we should be looking out for?  Is this something we should be trying to treat even if it does not rise to the level of intervention such as medicine based intervention.","cm5e8sg",1,1416263501,"2014-11-17 22:31:41"

Other people can be insecure in their mental states, so seeing it in someone else can make it easy to project their issues or hard to ignore their awareness/connection to it.

I have also had the opposite. For example, my college buddy and I were diagnosed around the same time and had all of our classes together. We could tell when the other had taken meds, hadn‚Äôt slept, meds wearing off, etc. We were very supportive and funny with each other about it.

"1648","Oooh that's a really good question. I think Black Museum was really good overall because of how it tied together other episodes, as well as the mini stories inside of it. It was like 3+ stories in one, which was awesome. I also really enjoyed Hated in the Nation. It was a little different than the others, like a Criminal Minds episode almost. The dark ending was great. Nosedive is the first episode I watched and also a personal favorite because it really highlights how vapid social media and just rich society in general. We're constantly worrying about appearing happy and fake all the time; there's no room for anything else. (And ugh I just hate rich culture in general) The family on my father's side is a lot like the people in that episode and I couldn't help but think of them the entire time. Playtest was really sweet, like an enhanced VR but with a twist. I was immediately interested in both that episode and USS Callister because I play games myself so I was like ""Oh this'll be good"". USS Callister was really good too, and the budget definitely shows! That episode has such great quality and I love the ending. I love how that episode started getting me to empathize with the guy, and then it turns out he's actually incredibly dark. I mean, I hated his coworkers too, but damn! And Hang the DJ!!!! Oh it was so cute. I loved that episode. Definitely lighter compared to the rest, but still great.

"1653","So I'm not 100% sure I have ADHD yet but my psychologist just basically told me she would recommend medication based on or interaction and test results. I find out for sure next week. 

Anyway, YAAASSSS. I LOVE TO LEARN NEW THINGS! I get super excited about them and hyper focus for a while then jump to something else. All my life friends and family have told me ""if you could only focus on one thing! You would do so well"" I feel like a jack of all trades and (this is going to sound egotistical) almost master of all? (I know and appreciate that I'm always learning - I absorb it quickly and keep the info for a long time and get really good at things then move on. Sometimes I go back to the hobbies though. I tend to rotate the crafty stuff.)

I have TONS of craft and art stuff. I also want to learn how to cobble, blacksmith, etc,.... 

I used to think i was just weird and something was wrong that I couldn't focus on one thing. I always get so frustrated that there's so little time and so much I want to learn! My husband often tells me ""you're never going to finish it all"" or, ""you're never going to have time to do all the things you want to do."" My todo list is often full (of normal things and crafty/DIY things) and I disappoint myself at the amount of things I actually accomplish. :/

I find that I am able to stick with things that are more abstract and can just lead to somewhere unexpected. Ceramics, knitting, sewing, and painting fit into this for me. 

I have to admit, I've almost purchased a whole set of metal alphabet stamps just to make gifts and I have a whole set of calligraphy and wax seals to write letters I never write. :) ...among jewelry supplies I never use, paper supplies I never use, some sculpture supplies I never use.... etc, etc. I often feel very much like ""squirrel!!!""","dmnz0zk",1,1504747443,"2017-09-07 01:24:03"

I know it‚Äôs annoying and I do try very hard not to quite as much. I was watching some videos a psychiatrist made about adhd the other day and one of the things she suggested was to try to wait 10 seconds after someone stops talking for your turn. She also suggested that people with adhd try to take a moment to write down a thought (and explain what they‚Äôre doing) rather than interrupting. It‚Äôs not easy but I‚Äôm working on doing those things with nt people I know. I‚Äôve gotten acceptance from them, so maybe something to try to improve communication skills.

Another thing I‚Äôve been trying to do is ask a question and listen to a response for every thing I want to say. Sometimes I get these interesting thoughts I want to share really badly, but instead of/in addition to just blurting them out, I also ask a question the other person would probably like. I‚Äôve also been working on making conversations less chaotic by explaining/transitioning to other topics slower.

There's a few different theories on why this is, but it mostly boils down to the person causing dopamine boosts, similar to other pleasuring activities, via the enjoyment you receive while being around them. It also has roots in the fact that many ADHD people experience more rejection than non-ADHD people, so when you find someone who embraces you, it's addictive. An important thing to keep in mind is that the obsession does pass, but you can still love or focus on the person after it does.","gtjacfo",1,1617682748,"2021-04-06 04:19:08"

Do some kind of sport every day before you sit down to work. I run every morning., but a brisk walk will do the trick if you don't like sports.

Learn to meditate. Damn its hard, but it is useful. At the very least, when you notice you are distracted, take three deep breaths, remind yourself what you should be doing, take one more breath, then do it.

Work in a clear, simple working space. Eliminate all visual or acoustic distractions.

Know exactly what your are working on. Only one thing to do at a given time, only one step to do on that thing, only one simple task in that one step. Give yourself 5 minutes to do that task. Set the timer. Try to beat the clock.","etl57u6",2,1562922200,"2019-07-12 09:03:20"

I literally just finished my accounting homework using chegg and I have my first exam tomorrow.  I 100% understand your situation. 

I know I cant sit still for more than 15 min without getting distracted by something so insignificant.  I find it bet to study around my craziness.  I'll set a timer and do homework or read my textbook for 10/20 min (depending on how anxious I am) then I'll go clean the toilet in the bathroom or I'll make my bed or play on my phone. I'll complete a small task that wont take up my day and will get back to my HW and will start the routine again.  
I also have to remind myself to worry about focusing on reading NOT worrying about all the things I have to do.  Thinking about all the things I have accomplished vs all the things I havent. 
Put things in a positive light. 

I dont have any great tips since I'm still struggling with the same problems, but know that in the end, the best always works out.  
I know what it's like to have anxiety for the future, worrying how every  tiny situation will affect me somehow down the road. 
Just remind yourself of all the incredible things you've accomplished in life so far, and know that you still have many things you will succeed on in the future.

"1719","Thanks for the response. 

I have found that on my medication, I feel the, let's call it urge, to get things done. I was telling this Psy.D, that I am just ... I guess you could call it ... stressed. Everything in my life creates stress. School, work, home, all stressful. I hate my house because there is constantly work to be done, and as I tell my wife, I feel like I take one step forward, and two steps back in it. 

I am completely unorganized. Organizing means buying things, buying things means spending money, spending money = stress. The only thing that motivates me to continue with school, is the fact that when I am done, I will have a MS to say, pay me more money. M-m-m-m-m-ore money, m-m-m-m-m-m-ore speech therapy (American Dad reference =)). I feel like, if I have more money then I can be less stressed. So I keep pushing harder and harder to make more money.  My organization method is, leave important things where I can find them. Top drawer of the desk, or around the desk. Eventually the desk gets cluttered. But if it is out of sight, it is out of mind for me. 

I am not sure what to do with the Psy.D. I expressed that I don't enjoy anything in life, including my hobbies, and was told that that is completely normal. That I start a hobby, get really into it, then just get bored with it because I am like, what is the point. They said that is normal, and that a hobby is to learn new things. I always thought a hobby was something you enjoyed doing. 

This Psy.D likes to focus on metrics, and I completely understand. With a... let's call it scientific... background, I understand the need to quantify results, establish baselines, set goals, and create metrics. But, I have spent the last 30+ years developing coping mechanisms to allow me to live with my ADHD. Even today, I went, ""Did I lock the car?"" and stopped while opening the door to my appointment to lock my car. If I can't remember if I did it, I will do it again just in case. I set all of my bills to automatic so I remember to pay them. I put my badges and keys by the front door, with my keys over my badges so I remember them. I do the morning ""check"" before I walk out the door... wallet, keys, phones, badges, watch, laptops. Ok, good. 

Yea... I forgot where I was going with that... 

I just honestly don't know what I am supposed to get out of the sessions. I figured it would be a little more guided.

"1735","This is the question you should have asked. Because the first one has zero consideration for the reality of it.

Stimulant medications suppress the limbic system. Its the cyclic system surrounding the connective tissue of the hemispheres of your cerebrum which is responsible for emotional inhibition and modulation.

Add onto that, the fact that the medication makes it easier to predict to then prevent impulse actions (which what people are doing when they ""control"" their impulses) and makes planning and coordination easier, then it makes perfect sense to not be ""yourself.""

You're not impulsively responding to the intense emotions anymore, so, You ""feel like a zombie,"" or ""not like yourself."" They have to choose how they react to their emotions. Something that people with adhd dont do by default.

So, asking if the med makes you apathetic showed that, not only did you not understand the medication, but you had a very bad misunderstanding (even thought you were trying to learn)

1. Figure out a reasonable timeframe that it would take to completely finish it. If you know you slack off and will procrastinate, give yourself more time rather than less. So let's say 2 months (I have no idea if that's accurate but just for an example.) 

2. Print off a calendar that shows the entire time frame on one sheet so you can see everything. If I can't see it all on one page my brain can't comprehend the weeks, but maybe that's just me.

3. Break project down into bits you can do per week. Ie organise layout week 1. Write intro week 2. Etc.

4. Try and sick to those timeframes. I feel so much less stressed when I know that this week all I have to do is one little piece rather than looking at an entire paper. You can break it down to as much or as little as you want. The more I break it down, the easier it is to not procrastinate. Good luck!","ga8wlc3",1,1603777003,"2020-10-27 05:36:43"

I had considered depression, anxiety, ocd, and bipolar disorder before my boyfriend and another friend suggested adhd in the same day once and it all clicked. what i read and learned about described me.. I just had the wrong impression of what it meant to have adhd all my life. 

sadly.. the first so-called professional that I saw also didn't have a very good impression of what adhd was all about. she told me that people with adhd can't do well in school, and dismissed the notion of me falling thru the cracks saying 'things like this just don't happen later in life'. and after I protested a bit about how I had read - over and over - that performance in school does not inherently mean someone does/doesn't have adhd, she told me that she thought I had narcissistic personality disorder. and she mocked me when I started crying.. accused me of faking it. it was unbelievable.

of course, when I was brave enough to seek help again, I went to a doctor who admitted she could not diagnose adhd, and so she referred me to a psychiatrist who specialized in adhd. and I was actually tested. she heard me out and was kind. and she exhibited an understanding of adhd beyond the DSM.. the sort of stuff we relate to on here.

it's sad really.. I was almost 30 before I realized I had adhd because of a deep lack of understanding for it.. and it's like the same sort of ignorance of what it really is affects a lot of professionals too.

&gt;

&gt;&gt;*This article is about the [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) and [psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry) meaning of the term.*

&gt;In psychology and psychiatry, __perseveration__ is the repetition of a particular response, such as a word, phrase, or gesture, despite the absence or cessation of a stimulus, usually caused by brain injury or other organic disorder.  Symptoms include ""lacking ability to transition or switch ideas appropriately with the social context, as evidenced by the repetition of words or gestures after they have ceased to be socially relevant or appropriate,""  or the ""act or task of doing so,""  and are not better described as [stereotypy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypy) (a highly repetitive [idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncrasy) behaviour).

&gt;In a broader sense, it is used for a wide range of functionless behaviours that arise from a failure of the brain to either [inhibit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory) [prepotent responses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions#Hypothesized_role) or to allow its usual progress to a different behavior, and includes impairment in [set shifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_shifting) and [task switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_switching_(psychology\)) in social and other contexts.

But one thing that added to my depression/anxiety was always feeling so frustrated and powerless. Bc I would watch myself make the same mistakes over and over again, and I was never able to stop it no matter what I tried. So after spending so much time watching myself struggle, I got familiar with my problems.

But now that I know I have ADHD, it's a bit better knowing I have an explanation for all the things I was struggling with. Makes me feel a little less powerless knowing that I'm not alone and that there are strategies I can try, even if they don't always work. But there's still always that frustration with myself that didn't go away. Sometimes it's even more frustrating bc now I really have all the answers but here I am still struggling.

Sometimes I wake up really late on Sundays and don't take the meds so they don't keep me awake.

At various points, I tried skipping one day or the whole weekend to see if it would prevent or delay med tolerance, but it didn't seem to matter.

Seems like most people who skip weekends do it because of bad med side effects. (I see people in this thread talking about meds making it harder to rrlac, messing up sense if humour, etc.) Ideally, you'd take a med that doesn't give you those issues, but I know that's not always possible.

Worst case scenario, it doesn't go well and nothing actually gets worse. Things stay the same and you can try again.  Best case scenario is a little bit of help, some breathing room, new strategies, maybe meds, and hope!

I have come up with the most clever, well thought out time management schemes and not one of them has worked for me. What has worked best for me is self-imposed time limits. I'll allow myself 10 minutes to sit and comfort a patient, but after that I have to get back to the 100 other things I need to do. I don't plan these ahead of time.

The other strategy I use is an obvious one, but it works. I have one list of everything I need to do by the end of the day. If something comes up and it doesn't warrant immediate action, I write it down. The day I started to allow myself to shelve tasks and come back to them was liberating.","c58dhr9",2,1341224840,"2012-07-02 10:27:20"

"1847","That being said, here are some clues for you. 

Do you have a long history of underachievment despite being perfectly capable on paper? 

Do you find ordinary life to be a struggle, in a way that doesn't seem to be true for other people? As in never remembering where you put your keys, constant tardiness, forgetting appointments-- stuff like that. 

Do others tend to describe you as lazy, or scattered, or spacey, or disorganized? Do you get so frustrated at not being able to do stuff correctly that you almost want to cry? 

As a child and possibly as an adult, are you constantly moving? Bouncing your legs, tapping your toes, drumming your fingers on the table? Do you ever tell people you're going to the restroom just so you can get up during a lecture or at work? 

Do you (once you get going) talk constantly, feeling like you have this huge stream of thoughts you must spit out right now? Do you get anxious listening to someone else talk at length because you need to say something and can't wait to get it out, and/or are worried you'll forget it if you don't? 

Do you routinely, and I mean like multiple times a day, arrive in a room only to realize you don't remember why you were going there? Or, conversely, suddenly remember that you've been surfing the web, but really you came upstairs to find your keys? 

Have you had trouble with sleeping in various ways for as long as you can remember, probably including things like finding nap taking impossible as a kid? 

Do you feel like your emotions kind of build up and then all the sudden you let loose a storm of emotion that probably seems really odd to others? For example: crying excessively at sad movies, exploding suddenly with anger over something minute but frustrating, or find yourself madly in love, effusively so, in every new or potential relationship? 

Do your friends complain that you are terrible at returning texts or emails? Do you have a lot of friendships or relationships that started with a torrent of activity, like hanging out every day, but now that you think about it you haven't spoken to that person in weeks? 

Is there one, or a few, activities that absorb you so much that you can spend hours doing them without being aware of it-- maybe even people calling your name and you don't hear it-- yet for the vast majority of things you're bored to tears in 15 minutes or so? 

Do you daydream a lot, or find yourself thinking about some crazy rabbit trail when others talk? 

Do you have a history of relational conflict-- like always fighting with your parents growing up, or relationships that involve a lot of fighting and making up? 

Do you not have a filter, and often find yourself either unintentionally (or even intentionally) saying shocking, startling, impolite, or unprofessional things? 

...last not least, is there something you should probably be doing right now but you've been on Reddit for an hour?

"1870","I'm an engineer too. What industry are you in ? In more traditional fields, at the start of your career, people give you less responsibility which also translates to more boring tasks. I think as an ADHD-er you'd be better off in a newer up and coming field with lots of room for young people to experiment (like a software startup) rather than an old and tired field with tons of hack work like Aerospace, for example. One thing I did to help me survive as an engineer was to volunteer for high stress positions - that was usually where things were messy enough to be interesting. I've also switched industries three times in the last 11 years (so once every 5 years) and that helps. Honestly engineering can be really stimulating for an ADHD brain as long as you stay in interesting design work or project manage interesting projects and keep moving. 

But in the end don't force yourself to stay in engineering just because you went to school for it. Don't believe the lies. Life is not meant to be lived in a way where you trade in your time (i.e. your life) for a pay-check. If you hate going to work make an exit plan -  whether that involves going back to school for something else, learning a trade, starting your own business, or cleaning houses and painting on the side.

"1879","Diagnosed at 18 halfway through my first year of college. I felt just like you: angry, sad, depressed, wondering what could've been. As time went on I met some people who were the opposite of me. Diagnosed as kids, forced to take pills they didn't want to and made fun of for being different and needing medicine. They grew to resent this medicine and now are completely off of it and one is even a believer of the big pharmaceutical conspiracies and stuff like that. Because they had meds as kids they never learned the struggle. They struggled even with their meds so now being off of it they struggle even more. Some don't though, some have the mind set that they won't let a mental disorder control their lives and they're gonna over come it. 


I realized a while ago that I am much better off the way things turned out. I spent months angry at the world but I slowly came to realize that it was a blessing in disguise. The very first day on adderall was the best day of my life. I was so angry and I thought if I could have just had this when I was a kid I would've been the best! There would be no limit to what I could have accomplished. Looking at the friends I have who were diagnosed as kids though makes me realize I don't know how I would've ended up. 


What I do know is that I spent 18 hard fucking years struggling up a hill with 100 pounds on my back. And on 2/2/16 I reached the top of the hill, threw my weights off and started sprinting down this mountain. Everyone else is walking but having lived so long with weights on my back I'm gonna run and I'm never gonna stop. I'm gonna catch up to all these people and leave them in the dust. 


So maybe I would've been valedictorian and gotten into UCLA on a full ride, or maybe I would've become a junkie addict to stims and thrown my life away. The truth is there's no way to know. What we do know is the now and what we can control is the now so there's no point doting on what if's, we gotta use this newfound motivation to its fullest extent because we know what it's like to always try twice as hard for half the result, but this time we're gonna try twice as hard and we're gonna get twice the result.

I was always ""not living up to potential"" and ""daydreaming"" too much. I couldn't focus, I lost things, etc. etc. etc. When I got out of high school it got much worse, but for a while I started to figure out ways to work around my problems. I started having major problems with anxiety and crippling OCD (I had symptoms in high school and then it it came back hard as an adult) and the inattentiveness, etc., started catching up with me again. I got help with my OCD when I was an adult, and it helped some, but the ADHD I was in denial about despite an unbelievable family history of it. I got in trouble in day jobs, but mostly managed to float by. When I quit and went to work for myself that's is when it got out of control. It was like being in high school again. Always forgetting things, etc. I confessed it all to my doctor. It turns out ADHD is often co-morbid with OCD. Since I started medication, I've been able to take control of my life. I think what happened is that my feeble coping mechanisms weren't strong enough for the increased responsibility of being self employed. You might be going through something similar.

"1888","This is my oldest ADHD tip, as it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been subconsciously doing my whole life. When I was born, my mom bought me this silky security blanket that has an especially silky tag on it.

I still have the blanket 25 years later and still rub the tag to fall asleep every night.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt until very recently when I realized the tag, for me, is essentially a sleepy time fidget toy. It acts as a source for expelling energy and the repetitive motion calms me down. I don‚Äôt bring it with me when I go on trips or overnights and I notice that I toss and turn a lot more and have much more trouble staying still enough to relax.¬†

"1908","I can understand coming to that conclusion.  I think I feel strongly about it because I was a girl educated in a Catholic school in the 90's, and even during *that* decade, girls weren't encouraged to be interested in or good at math and science.  So I did poorly because, like you said, my brain shut off.  I thought it was something innate until, 15 years later, I went back to college to get a Biology degree, and ended up acing Calculus and Physics. (This was also about the time I got diagnosed, incidentally.)  I made a conscious decision to throw away my preconceptions about myself and my abilities, and just *try*.  Try anything and see what happened without judging it.  

It's true that some people have strengths that others don't, and I wouldn't say I loved math so much that I want to pursue a degree in it.  It took work and focus, but in the end, I found out that I wasn't *bad* at it, so much as I had to learn it differently than people who say they're *good* at it.  It's all about the language you use about yourself, you know?  You can tell yourself you're bad at something, or you can tell yourself that you might not be right now, but with some effort, you're going to master something.

I want to tell you how much your work means to me personally. You are a mentor to me. I want you to know I really appreciate you turning the loss of your brother into a motivation to speak so openly on ADHD and it‚Äôs effects. I am a transgender male (I was born female) so I went undiagnosed for 22 years because I was able to compensate with my emotional and mental intelligence. I have combined type, but not as much hyperactivity as impulsivity. If you didn‚Äôt speak so bluntly and openly about this disorder I may not have been able to understand I fit the description and quality for a diagnosis of this disorder. Thank you for being you and advocating so strongly for people like me. I can‚Äôt tell you how much it means to me. One thing I have to ask- my mother is a teacher of gifted students and missed my diagnosis even though she frequently has children with ADHD in her classroom. What would you say is the most common reason so many female children go undiagnosed by their parents? In addition, the warning signs that parents should keep in mind that are different from just a roudy child? Thank you again for your work.","glsbvcs",1,1612302568,"2021-02-02 21:49:28"

"1935","Ditto. I thought I might be bipolar, but now realize that it's usually related to my actions and environment.

One theory I have is, that it's related to dopamine release. Maybe if we get more excited than other, we also release more dopamine and other neurotransmitters like seratonine and kind of cause ourselves a resistance/tolerance. Maybe ADHD brains don't have a steady release valve so having fun or even working and being productive causes us to overuse our resources.

This could cause a dopamine ""hangover"" which takes 2-4 weeks to recover from. 

What helps me is knowing that it's temporary and that people still like me even when I don't feel like the best me :)","emsy1ua",2,1557290818,"2019-05-08 04:46:58"

"1939","A few people here have mentioned routine and that is definitely the key to getting a good sleep. And since sleep is as important as food, water, and air so you really need to get it under control. Sadly, there is no magick out there that will give you a regular good sleep. You have to use self control.


For the majority of people falling asleep somewhere between 10pm to 12am is best. You may be different but starting with this range is a pretty safe to start developing your routine. Aside from that, it's whatever winds you down and gets your body into sleep mode.


I've spent many many years trying to work this out and it's not until 2014 that I got it down to something I can reliably replicate every night and know for certain I will get a good sleep.


What works for me is this...

First, there are three things that will destroy my chances of falling asleep or waking on time (if at all) completely. If I do either it's game over and I'll end up wasting an entire day because I slept too late or not enough.

1. I cannot eat past 6pm (sometimes I can risk a little later and I'm ok). If I must it can only be something small and light. No meat or empty carbs and sugar. If I'm not going to die of starvation usually water or non caffeinated tea is enough to settle the urge. This is very important because hunger plays an important roll synchronizing your circadian clock. Have a drink of water right after you wake and not too long after you wake something to eat whether it's  light or a full breakfast. This will set your internal clock, which control which hormones are released and when, to turn you on and wake you up because you need food. It may not seem to do much on the first day but on the second or perhaps the third your body will just click into place. 

2. If I'm still computing or doing some other cerebral activity up to the time I need to be in bed I may have troubles falling asleep and risk messing up the following day. If I go any later I'll lose all concept of time and all of a sudden it's 2am and I' screwed. 


I plan to generally fall asleep around 11pm. Sometimes it's ends up being a little earlier or later but because my plan is for 11pm I start my routine at 9:30 and go take a nice hot shower. I have soaps and a scrubber that I love, shave if I need to, etc. I don't rush it and make sure I'm nice and relaxed. Dry off and get into something clean that I can lounge for a bit in.


After all that is done I take a few squirts of a skullcap / valerian tincture. Valerian is awesome! About 15 minutes after taking it, which is usually on an empty stomach, I can feel myself get warm and cozy. At first I tried the capsules with powder but I never got much effect so I tried the tincture and it made a world of difference. About a year ago I changed to one made by the same co. that also has skullcap, passion flower, plus a couple other ingredients and it is even better. Since taking the concoction, not only has falling asleep been easier but overall quality has improved and in the morning I feel awake quickly and refreshed. Not all brands are equal, so if you try something like this do some research. I'm happy to post the brand I use if you're interested.


For the next hour or so I just lounge around doing just passive things. Read, write in my journal, watch netflix 'er something.  All fairly relaxing and passive things though. I don't do any of this in my bedroom because I need to keep it strictly for sleeping. I don't know your situation but if your bedroom is your only private / relaxing space then you should at least try to keep these kinds of things off your bed. Once it's about time to sleep I go to bed, get comfortable, pop either a whole or half 3mg melatonin tab under my tongue and close my eyes. I lay on my back and in a sort of meditative way just release everything in my head and get my mind centered. My thoughts race, it's fucking insane really, but I found that I can just not respond or indulge any of them. They're there but the 'act' of centring yourself kind of moves them off to the side into the periphery. Soon, usually no more than 10 minutes, everything is quiet and I suddenly find my self wondering if that was real or ...yeah, it was just a dream. Get up quickly and have some water and get on with my day.","cytlxd1",1,1452480131,"2016-01-11 02:42:11"

I got first place every year in the school education fair, but only because she constantly pressured and motivated and basically forced me to work. I was constantly zoning out, or wanting to jump around and play, and just had the worst time focusing. I got punished for it all the time too. Sometimes I would just start giggling and being silly and hyper for no reason and my mom would say she was scared I was displaying symptoms of mania since my dad was bipolar. What a fucked up thing to say to a little kid, huh? I got in trouble in class all the time for speaking out of turn, being disruptive (chopped half my hair off on my first day of first grade just cuz I was so bored sitting at my desk lol), not paying attention, severe rejection sensitive dysphoria and social issues... but because I was doing 4th grade math in 2nd grade, my mom thought I was just obstinate and lazy.

I've actually had to lock myself out of twitter because I'd discovered it's starting to feel like it's sapping my ability to even feel desires for other stimuli.

"1976","I feel your pain.... I was in the military and 3 times in 5 years I had an emotional breakdown, I learn rather quickly that I could not explain my actions when I was perceived to do something wrong. SO this created a type of neuropathway to form that, when I would put on my uniform I felt helpless. So when I would be pulled into an office and given paperwork (letter of counseling or reprimand) I was conditioned to not explain myself. Feeling helpless to fix my problems causes me so much confusion and frustration that it would lead me to an emotional breakdown.   


Being a young male in the military, with a bunch of older traditional males, and being a mechanic.... Crying is NEVER an ok or accepted thing. I know for sure that my reaction was told to the other members and that leads to people using it to further make me feel bad....   


In any similar situation in my life I would handle those situations better but when I either put on my uniform or a certain authoritative ton is taken with me, RSD slaps me in the face and I submit... which makes me feel incredibly weak.

My story is pretty similar to yours. The first psych I saw though ended up running a number of tests and concluded that I don't have ADHD (I do.). The second one I saw concluded within three minutes of meeting me that I have ADHD and might benefit from adderall.

After that it's been easy. The third one I saw (after I lost the second)basically just chatted with me for a bit and continued treatment where #2 left off.

The fact of the matter is that all three of those people I've seen don't actually know if I have ADHD or not. I'm the only one that knows what is going on in my head, and there is no test that reliably diagnoses ADHD. What matters is that I benefit from ADHD meds, so I do what I need to in order to get them.

What are you trying to ask...? A lot of people (I didn't) experience some sort of high or euphoria the first few times they take amphetamines. What does this have to do with anything though?

All these articles suggesting adhd is fake and that people overdiagnose it and overprescribe medication to make money seem to disregard the simple fact that *people benefit from medication*.

It's not like I take adderall because I've been tricked into believing I need it O.o I doubt that's true for anyone, maybe a small percentage. I carefully pay attention to how it affects me and there are definite beneficial effects.

&gt; I am concerned about the long term adverse affects of medication &gt;but no one seems to have any hard proof outside of random claims on &gt;internet forums.

Yes. This is because there *isn't* really much evidence to determine that, *in humans*, taking amphetamines over 10+ years is noticeably damaging too the brain. There have been a lot of studies following people for 1-2 years that have proven them safe for that time. It's just hard to study people for 10 or 20 years.

Maybe someone will agree to move.""  She got on the second floor by the grace of a very kind student.

&amp;#x200B;

But talking to the on-campus medical center is the worst.  I'm trained every year on their policies and procedures.  I KNOW they have a floating doctor with no appointments available EVERY DAY, just for walk-ins.  But all of my students are turned away or told there's no availability until they come to me and I call.  When I mention their policies, suddenly my student can be seen right away.

&amp;#x200B;

And it's a super nice, private school.  People are just super shitty to students, and they get away with it because 18 year olds are used to blindly following what 'adults' say to them.  Bullshit.","eqnlx4f",2,1560177493,"2019-06-10 14:38:13"

"2106","I developed a trick for dealing with this.

Just stay up until 3-4:00 AM every single night, so you are perpetually running on only a few hours of sleep throughout the day, every week day. You will never have trouble falling asleep again.

Alternatively, you can use my other trick for falling asleep:
Lie perfectly still without moving. Resist every urge to move. You will eventually start getting random itches all over your body. That is your body checking to see if your brain is sleeping yet. If you can resist the urge to scratch yourself or move for a couple minutes, eventually your body will start putting itself to sleep and you will experience that ""warm blanket"" feeling moving up your body starting from your feet, and your mind will fall asleep shortly after.

Using this method you can also occasionally experience the process of your brain falling asleep while maintaining lucidity, which can be pretty trippy. You never quite understand just how vivid your dreams actually are until you experience them while you are still ""awake"".","eq6anc8",2,1559825569,"2019-06-06 12:52:49"
"2107","Yep, totally! While there is no excuse for being in the moment and doing it despite the clear ""no""'s, I can give him a lot of credit for realizing almost immediately after what was going on and apologizing, admitting that his desires took over my feelings, which my feelings towards what he does to me should be higher prioritized - dating him for 3 years and knowing him for 4, I can definitely pick up on when he's being genuine about his apologies/admittings to feeling horrible about it, and I'm willing to forgive him because he does actively show that he does puts me and my feelings before him and his desires and does try to stick to that as much as he can, esp in the bed as I'm really much more traditional with NSFW acts while he's more adventurous (I know thats quite TMI but LMAOO it has to be said, its the only way I can get my point across to me). It really does suck when he gets a little too hungry wherein he hears me say no but not process it as ""I should stop she doesn't want this"", but luckily it hasn't even DAWNED onto the any of the levels that even have a tiny bit of ""holy shit this is bad and we need to separate"" sparkle in them. I think the little too hungry part has happened a total of one (1) time, and he's since been trying to improve on it.

I think the positive thing about me having ADHD is that the more I know someone, the better able I am to pick up on when they're being serious/genuine about certain topics (feeling bad, past life experiences, etc.) and when they're being silly/goofy. Of course there is some leniency to be factored in because honestly anyone can be unpredictable and/or be such a mastermind at manipulation that I THINK they're genuine when they're not, but I'm glad that's the one thing ADHD has helped me with. While 4 years doesn't seem that lengthy, and I still do learn plenty about my boyfriend for every issue (big or small) we go through together, I can say with at least a 70%+ or 80%+ certainty that I know my boyfriend and the possible ways he'll react when I talk to him about serious things.","fvgzdah",1,1592684185,"2020-06-20 20:16:25"

"2131","Hey mate, figured I'd switch computers so that I could answer this one since I can relate to this a lot and wish I had someone help me when I was younger. So I always fall super hard for girls I'm genuinely into and once I'm talking to them, on a date, or have an ""in"" one way or another oversharing just happens. I'm still not good at dealing with it and I am a bit younger than you, but maybe my experience can still help. 

I don't necessarily think it's dumb or terrible to reveal personal stuff early, and with the ""right"" girl it might not even matter, but obviously each case is different and that's little consolation when it feels like you're missing out on potential relationships today. So, what has worked for me, when I'm able to wrangle my brain into doing it, is letting the girl lead that type of stuff. I kind of just categorize how personal I feel her stories are, and then respond in kind. So if I think she's sharing something really personal, then I'll be more open as well. But I've also been with girls who I didn't share any of my real shit with even if we had known each other for years. 

Long story short, it depends, but I think the most consistent way to not overshare without knowing exactly what type of person you're talking to is to just let them set the boundaries and then stay within them.","g2v1bxz",1,1598402785,"2020-08-26 00:46:25"

"2140","Honestly, it sounds like your Mom has an addiction problem with Adderall. Because feeling like you need something, to level where it's unhealthy and you think you'll die if you don't have it, is exactly what addiction is. 

She probably needs professional help with both this and the depression. But, the thing about relying on a substance like that, is it normally makes depression worse over time. So, it's hard to actually treat the depression fully without addressing the substance use issue. But, Adderall is not supposed to treat depression anyway. I would suggest her seeking out a doctor to help with both the Adderall issue specifically and the depression. 

You can't ever make someone get help for something like this, but you can suggest it. And, if you can, stop enabling her by giving her your medication. There are other resources you can give someone to help with suicidal thoughts too. That you could suggest to her instead and offer to be there for her/talk through things if she needs it. A controlled (medically supervised) detox from the Adderall might be helpful, if she thinks decreasing it will make her suicidal.

"2150","I have honestly no idea. We haven't studied these in class yet and I haven't asked personally.  

Typically (as I understand it and I don't know the whole picture), tolerance to a medication is often caused by the body down-regulating (getting rid of) receptors for that medication, or something similar. And usually, staying away from the medication for a while will cause the body to do the opposite - put them back. So, this is the thinking that you hear, that you need to take breaks. (Again, I don't know if this applies to these or not, just mentioning it).

Right now, we are still getting my meds balanced. I take a higher doses when I'm studying and less when I'm hanging out at the house. There is a different level of alertness and focus that I need.  The body would regulate it normally, so its more along the same lines when I take a little bit less.  I take 4 hour pills. It's out of my system rather quickly.

My current boyfriend has a son with ADHD and would never say something like that. I've never had a problem finding people who understand about my disorder and are supportive. 

If someone won't take your word for it that you can't help certain things, to the point that you need a video to back you up because your own testimony is not considered valid enough by itself, that person does not respect you and doesn't deserve you. The people in your life are supposed to be your support system, not the ones you have to justify yourself to and defend yourself against. 

You say you can't help a particular thing like not being able to pay attention in a conversation, and they don't believe you, to the point you need a video to prove that this really happens to people with ADHD. What does that say about what the other person must think of you? They think you're a liar. They think you're either choosing not to listen to them or that you have no discipline as a person. Anyone who doesn't believe you about your ADHD, by default, believes you have poor character and can't possibly respect you, because they don't have any other way to explain your behavior, because they judge you according to the standards of a neurotypical. I personally could not be in a relationship with someone who looks at me that way. 

Just because you have ADHD doesn't make you less of a person. You still deserve to be respected and treated well, and shouldn't have to justify yourself to someone or prove to someone that your disorder is real, or that your struggles are due to your disorder and not a moral failure.

"2174","It is very good and kind of easy to watch for someone with ADHD as well imo. The speaker is very authoritative and sort of dramatic which keeps it interesting in a way.

I have some criticism though: He carries on the same confidence when talking about things that are actually debated and generalizes a lot. This is especially seen in chapter 3C which is about SCT. That one brought me some confusion since his generalizations didn't allow for my own situation (relating quite a bit to the SCT symptoms but having clear indicators of not having it).

For example he says that you would never apply the term ""socially reticent"" to an ADHD child, but he also says people with SCT does not have the executive deficits and mostly have problems with accuracy of schoolwork, they get their schoolwork done.  
As someone who struggle with the executive deficits and getting things done but also is socially reticent/anxious watching this video early in the process of getting my diagnoses was very confusing and added to my thoughts of ""maybe this is all a mistake, nothing is wrong with me I am just a bad person"".  
These kinds of generalizations are not really beneficial to anyone, except perhaps to a psychiatrist trying to lobby the DSM-workgroup into going along with his findings (which they didn't, SCT did not make it into DSM-V).  
And then it turns out Russell Barkley has [recieved quite a bit of money from a drug company that might be interested in furthering that agenda](https://projects.propublica.org/d4d-archive/search?company%5Bid%5D=&amp;period%5B%5D=&amp;services%5B%5D=&amp;state%5Bid%5D=41&amp;term=barkley&amp;utf8=_).

In general his presentation is quite bombastic and generalizing which makes his points very clear, but borders on being misinformation at times since he never explains that things are not always so clear cut. Another example of his generalizations is always describing the person with ADHD as someone with very severe symptoms of ADHD, if 7% of people was actually at that level of impairment it would have some dire consequences for society I think.

Regardless, the presentation is very interesting to watch and full of very clearly communicated information. Even if it sounds more informative than it actually is due to the above concerns, it is still by far the most informative video I have found to explain ADHD and it very clearly spells out what the struggles of someone with ADHD is.  
For anyone who thinks ""kids with ADHD is really just kids with bad parents"" this video might be the right kick in the guts.","dj09qvn",3,1497656480,"2017-06-16 23:41:20"

"2180","You don't need to do a big song and dance. If he's at all competent he should be able to separate out drug seekers from those who are ADHD. 

When I was on the phone with a psychiatrist trying to get my first appointment, the psychiatrist wanted to know why I was seeking a diagnosis. In my case, I'd had my suspicions and voiced them to my GP who gave me a prelim test. The short-form test confirmed our theory so she sent me to get properly diagnosed by a specialist. In retrospect, the psychiatrist started asking me to explain why I thought I had adhd until I told her my GP was the one who suggested a psychiatrist and she booked me an appointment. Obviously a drug seeker could fake a short term test, but the word of my GP got me in the door and the resulting testing confirmed my ADHD.

In your case, you can tell him that you have suspicions and so did your teachers but your family didn't agree and refused to get you tested. Now that you're an adult you want answers. Honesty is the best policy. If he asks if you want drugs, you can say you're open to medication but that a proper diagnosis is what's important. Because that is also true.

My testing took place over two sessions, each one two hours, and included a 14 page questionnaire to help rule out other conditions like Bipolar, ASD, BPD etc. She was thorough and there is literally no way a drug seeker could have faked their way through the sessions and the questionnaire also included one section for a partner or family member to fill out. In my case it was making sure that my symptoms were ADHD and not something else since I also have GAD and clinical depression.

Testing is different depending on which country you are in and what sort of doctor you're seeing, but here are some things to prepare before you have your appointment:

Make a list of your symptoms and how they impact your life. Don't forget any sensory issues as well as the obvious stuff. Track them back to childhood. He might want to know details about various things and if you have it pre-prepared you won't have to remember anything on the fly.

Think about your family and if anyone related to you also has ADHD (diagnosed or suspected) because ADHD runs in families. 

If you have any other diagnoses like GAD or depression, you should also tell your doctor about those.

I also suggest getting a therapist who can help you find ways to manage your symptoms. If you decide to do this, tell the doctor that a diagnosis would help direct your therapy.","evtxdkx",1,1564780584,"2019-08-02 21:16:24"

My daughter is perfectly warm when it's 50 out, which amazes me. She has ADHD too, so obviously this isn't a universal ADHD thing, but in the case of you &amp; me, it may be part of it.

Colder weather (like between 40-60 F) is the only time I end up unprepared, but I find dressing in layers helps. Like I'll wear a work-appropriate short sleeve shirt or blouse, and then a 3/4 sleeve (for 55-60 degree days) or long sleeve (for 40-55 degree days) overshirt/sweater/cardigan/jacket over that.... and then a hoodie, rain jacket, or winter coat over that depending on the weather. That way no matter what the weather actually IS (or does - it swings from 40 in the morning to 80 in the afternoon here some days), I look fine and feel fine. I am prepared lol.

"2207","You're asking for your home life, but this can also apply to work:

Step 1: Recognize that you do it. Congrats! You've already made progress!

Step 2: This is a hard one; you'll have to internalize the concept that other people are allowed to do things their own way. 

And that's it, really. Once you can accept that other people are allowed to accomplish goals and tasks using their own brain, you'll stop micromanaging. However, getting to that point may take some time and a bit of practice, so here's some things you can do to help you along the way:

Delegate expectations, not tasks. If you want the laundry done, then you should expect clean clothes that are folded and put away; it doesn't matter how that gets done. If your boyfriend wants it to take eight hours, that's his choice and his time to spend. 

Physically remove yourself from the room once you ask him to do something. If you can't refrain yourself from commenting on every little thing he does, then remove yourself from the room so you can't see it. Go do something else and let him do the stuff in peace. 

Learn to trust him that he can get things done. Micromanaging is all about a lack of trust in your team (or in your case, your life partner). Trust that he can get it done. And if you can't trust him, why are you dating him?

Remember that things don't need to be perfect. Perfectionism is one of the leading causes of micromanaging. It's ok to not be perfect. It's ok to fail. Just so long as we learn from our failures. On that note,be forgiving when we do slip up (you need to forgive him AND yourself), and apologize when you do it. Don't justify your actions, just apologise and move on. 

If worse comes to worse and you can't stop yourself, then separate tasks; you do all the tasks that must be done your way, and give him the the tasks that allow him more freedom. If you don't like the way he does the dishes, ask yourself, ""Are they still clean in the end?"" If yes, then what's it matter? But if you still have to demand it's done your way, then make the dishes your responsibility, not his. Let him do something else, like vacuum or put away clothes or do yard work, things like that. 

Little things like that, I feel, are the worst things to fight over when in a relationship. My wife and I don't even talk about things like that - we literally have no conversations about dishes or laundry or any household chores except, ""Has [chore] been done, or should I do it?"" or ""I'll do [chore]."" We keep our conversations to things that actually help make life more pleasant, like talking about the latest scientific discoveries, or our opinions of movies and books, or a new way to cook a meal that sounds really good - things like that. We try keep our conversations intellectual. Any arguments we have almost always become conversations about what the data and evidence is on a topic, and we both end up growing and learning together.","exfkug1",1,1566242768,"2019-08-19 19:26:08"

"2232","The short answer is yes.  The long answer is that there are two sides of this.

The ""strictly ADHD"" side is that adults especially will internalize hyperactive tendancies as ""fretting"".  So replaying conversations with people over and over, constantly evaluate and re-evaluate their relationships, analyze every minute response from another person, and extrapolate sweeping conclusions from these observations- until it seems like everything is a sign that people hate you and think you're worthless.  Do that enough and it'll really mess with your head.

The other part is that other ADHD symptoms (espeically if you go years undiagnosed) will lead to the person with ADHD being told over and over that they are lazy, stupid, underachieving, a bad friend/family member, and so on.  ""Never good enough"" is about the same as ""if only you'd apply yourself..."" which most ADHD people have heard time and time again.

I mentioned to my therapist that I disagreed with this. I said that I didn't think ADHD symptoms remitted at all in adulthood. Instead, I believe that we develop compensation strategies, both conscious and unconscious, that make our symptoms less apparent - sometimes even to ourselves. He **strongly** agreed.

He was also unsurprised when I reported that the meds that seemed to work best also interfered with some positive aspects of my life and increased the frequency of some of my symptoms like hyper-focus. He agrees with the working theory I expressed above about unconscious compensations getting scrambled my the meds.

The assumption is that we will learn new compensations over time as we adjust to being fully medicated all the time. I have decided to take this path instead, as it feels better to me.

Sure, sugar isn't that great for you, but everything in moderation. Cleanses are the dietary equivalent of hyperfocus cleaning your windowsills for two hours. Sure they do a thing for that time period but they're unsustainable and ultimately bad for you. The idea that a cleanse ""makes you feel shitty at first"" is because they're basically pretty shitty. Unless you have a super specific reason for doing so, eliminating most things entirely is at least unnecessary and can be harmful. (Allergies and ACTUAL medical conditions excluded. I'm all for bodily autonomy at the end of the day, and I do believe diet is more individual than we realize, but ""sugar"" is a ridiculously broad category.)

And at the end of the day, sugar is sugar is sugar, whether it's chocolate pancakes or strawberries. Sorry.

Now, do I feel better when I eat less sugar? Mostly, but I feel even better when I'm eating regular meals, eating food I enjoy--which includes cake sometimes! and sometimes salad!--and working out. Way better for you, way more sustainable. Cutting things out entirely makes you WAY more likely to rebound and binge or go back at it even harder. Why bother?

"2274","I had a middle school teacher once ask the class ""How do you eat an elephant?"" to which the answer turned out to be ""One mouthful at a time."" As ridiculous as that statement is, it's something I've found memorable and useful in life. No matter how big and overwhelming a task is, it can always be broken down into bitesize chunks. 

I find it really easy to fall into that same trap of having one bad day, leading to bad sleep leading to unproductivity leading to anxiety and then getting so overwhelmed, I don't get anything done for weeks. But the 2 general principles I eventually use to get back to doing things is:  
1. Minimize the number of things on your to-do list. (Focus on getting out of bed, making sure to eat and do the basics, and 1 to at most 3 to-do's for the day)  
2. Keep to-do's small and realistic. E.g. Clean the house isn't a realistic task. Put the dishes away is. If that's the only thing planned for the day, it doesn't feel as overwhelming. If that's difficult, make it ""put away one dish."" You can always reduce it to something that doesn't seem too overwhelming

Oftentimes I find after having finished all of my to-do's, I have half the day left, at which point I'll get more stuff done using the momentum of that 1-3 small tasks, but it's important to start with planning small. With too much to get done, it gives my brain too much procrastination fodder to choose which thing to do first and I spend the whole time just jumping around trying to decide which one to do and in effect get nothing done.

We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a year. Every day, focus on doing one thing you didn't get done yesterday, and eventually, you'll realize you've gotten a great deal more done than you expected!","femga92",1,1579253976,"2020-01-17 09:39:36"

An anecdote does not mean much. But I can only speak for me. That said - most mental issues have tons of root causes. Depression can stem from physical problems - ie after a car accident that affects the spine. 

Also - if you're raised in a very structured environment but have undiagnosed adhd it may not be as apparent because you learned how to create systems. I think it can be both but primarily nature over nurture.","fenirpg",1,1579285582,"2020-01-17 18:26:22"

No, I'm going to say again this is bad. If the parents don't have ADHD then the drugs aren't going to affect them the same way it does their children. The parent might decide that the medicine gets their kids ""high"" because it got them high; not good. And if the parent has ADHD (which is statistically more likely due to genetics) they still shouldn't be taking someone else's drugs even if it helps. What if it's the wrong dosage (too low, too high) or they have really bad side effects? Plus, it's still illegal. I appreciate the context (and I read the comments) but it's just plain irresponsible to go around advocating prescription drug abuse, and it reflects badly on people who legitimately need those drugs to function on a daily basis.

He can see what task he is on and there is a waning linear visual to indicate how much time he has left for a given task. There is an audio warning when time for the particular task is nearly up. Once he's completed a task, he swipes left to begin the next task. After he's been through the succession of tasks, he gets a 'good job' message that lets him know that he's earned a reward (tv time, reading time, game time etc are preloaded options, but you can also customize your own). Since you set the allotted times, it'll also tell the child when reward time is up &amp; that it's time to move on (to leave for school, go to bed, or whatever).

Routine is something that is completely necessary despite the fact that it can be difficult to me and others. if not I would forget so many things. I  find that if I have a very set routine and even to do lists for everyday things I get things done.

Serious Eats mentioned elsewhere here is also reliably great, especially The Food Lab. But I don't have the patience to cook a lot of the recipes. If you're like me, ditto the advice to cook big for a week. I'd add in crockpot recipes too.

Random other things that have helped me:

* Get prewashed and pre-sliced veggies and other things so you can skip a step or two
* Learn what can be prepped and saved ahead of time (like single serving rice in the freezer - and I say this as someone who is Asian and has a $300 rice cooker)
* Go all out on a collection of sauces and spices. They can make it easy to cook (sometimes just slather a sauce all over a piece of meat and cook it kind of easy) or they can make it easy to enhance a food without sacrificing healthiness. Also drastically lets me cut down on salt, which isn't great for you in excess. (Unfortunately I find it hard to go out and eat because so much is oversalted to my taste...)
* Keep some basics at hand all the time. My husband really likes to have sandwich fixings around for when it's 2pm and he forgot to eat lunch. My idea of basics is things like curry paste and coconut milk and bamboo shoots + leftover meat for a quick curry (and rice from the freezer ;) ) Bittman can help you with this at the beginning of the book I linked (and I think he also has a ""cooking for beginners"" type book as well in the How to Cook... series)
* Keep things simple and expand on the basics. One of my favorite meals is a cheese or chicken/bacon/leftover meat quesadilla, and a small side salad. Takes 5 minutes tops to assemble. I used the same technique to use leftover shredded pork Chinese delivery for moo shu pork with my own hoisin (remember the sauces?) and the fresh tortillas I had in my fridge. Then a breakfast burrito in the morning!
* Soup is a great way to get rid of leftovers. 
* Smoothies are a great way to eat veggies. Blend in some spinach+kale with ""strong"" flavored fruits like frozen berries, mmmm! Don't forget to toss in some nut butter too :)
* In case you forget to eat altogether - my ""secret"" is Ensure. On-the-go drinks are super convenient and at least stop me from snacking endlessly until the next meal.","cn1n6it",2,1419199999,"2014-12-21 22:13:19"

"2363","I think getting him to understand is part of it.  The other part is going about it in a way that lets him feel like you are working on ways to minimize the impact your ADHD has on him.  I also think leaving it to him to learn about it might not be the best - why not prepare some information you want him know and potentially print out some pages from the internet on how a partner can help someone with adhd.  Then while you are going through this, have a list of things you are aware of that upsets him or frustrates him that is due to your adhd, and a list of things you can proactively do to minimize the negative affects he feels.

It's a two way street, of him being understanding and you going above and beyond to try to make his life easier in situations where you know you will have ""adhd moments""

This kind of ""plan of attack"" for dealing with ADHD has worked so well for me and my fiance.  I am aware of situations that I know will negatively affect us due to my adhd, so I have plans in place to try to avoid them and he is aware I work hard on those plans, this in turn makes him more forgiving and understanding and has helped a lot in us growing and working together as a couple.","d5xfa4k",3,1469904047,"2016-07-30 18:40:47"

"2414","I'll just say that I tried to get through college the natural way, thinking that I didn't have ADHD and that I just needed to buckle down and will myself to do the work. I barely made it through the first year and then failed the second and got kicked out of my program. This is despite the classes I failed having otherwise easy content and despite all of my best intentions. I got my diagnosis, was placed on medication, and suddenly everything felt ""right"" and when I was back in school, my grades jumped from Fs and Cs to Bs and a few As. 

I don't know how you are and everybody is different, but I've tried everything and still can't get by without medication. And even on medication, you still have to deal with having had a lifetime of not learning the proper study skills and work ethic, so it can still be a struggle. So I have to take my medication, find somewhere really silent and isolated, block my internet (using apps like Self-Control or Focus), hide my phone, and hope that I don't run into anyone I know along the way, as well as using to-do lists and scheduling my time.

Any of the usual advice given to students about how to be productive and manage their time well applies, probably even more so if you have ADHD. I don't know if you want to hop on meds (though I'd recommend it) and I don't know if you're even diagnosed with ADHD yet, but know that studying and getting through your classes should be mildly difficult and tedious, but not impossible. If you feel like you're putting in a disproportionate amount of effort compared to the average person, then it can't hurt to seek help.  ","dmo0sal",1,1504749830,"2017-09-07 02:03:50"

As a teenager I had ""friends"" who ""helpfully"" pointed it out and refused to let me speak, forced me to sit on the edge of groups, talked over me. I also had a boyfriend in college who would actually ration how much I was allowed to speak. Fuck that dude, what a fucking knobhead.

Unschooling is successful if the child and parent are engaged.  Same thing goes for student and teacher.

"2447","No no no no no. Oh my god, I can't believe people are still being told this fairy tale. ADHD is a serious disorder, there are zero advantages to having ADHD unless you count the character building that comes with overcoming the hardship of having it.

This kind of thinking only serves to marginalize a disorder which in reality can be severely debilitating, anyone thinking like this is doing themselves and everyone else with ADHD as disservice. This is the same logic that leads people to believe that ADHD medication is somehow cheating, or that they somehow don't have a real problem.

ADHD is a much more severe disorder than what was believed when the disorder was first discovered. It wouldn't even be called ADHD any more if it wasn't such a logistical and political nightmare to change the name of a disorder.

It's not a qualitative disorder like autism, but a quantitative disorder, as in instead of being prone to socially unacceptable behaviour it's an issue with being able regulate emotions and other executive functions. In reality motivation and willpower are simply a result of the human brain's ability to perceive time and envision the future in the frontal lobe, and then have an actual emotional response to that imagined stimulus through complex mechanisms linking the frontal lobe to older parts of the brain (in evolutionary terms) that regulate our emotions.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder doesn't even come close to describing the real problem, which is a deficiency in the functionality of communicative mechanisms between the frontal lobe and older mammalian brain structures. It's an executive functioning disorder, it's an inability to fully utilize an otherwise perfectly healthy frontal lobe.

It's a deficiency in the ability to utilize the very part of the brain that makes humans so capable, the part of the brain that gives us our understanding of the concept of time itself.

People who actually have severe ADHD often grew up in abusive family environments, it's not just genetic... being abused as a child will actually physically and permanently damage normal brain development. ","cvz7b8v",10,1444810491,"2015-10-14 08:14:51"

"2450","Though the point is those studies were small and didn't really look at comparable groups. The new study says that ADHD itself, not unmedicated ADHD, is a risk factor for drug abuse.

My question is more - If 20% of boys need ADHD meds, are we really medicating a true disorder, or just behaviors we dislike? When I was young, they saved the meds for the kids who were so seriously impaired that they literally could not function without them. Those of us who had trouble sitting still or organizing or thinking linearly just got more time to run around (My first grade teacher let me run laps whenever I got too ADD), more communication with parents to keep us doing our work, and more help learning to organize (except from the mean teachers who humiliated us and dumped out our desks in the middle of class and whatnot.)  

To me, the high percentages make me wonder if we're putting kids on drugs with pretty significant side effects when there are other ways we could help them.

Plus, it seems like a lot of people have a problem with developing resistance to the drugs. Yet we're not giving them the cognitive therapy and coping skills that they need for long term success.

"2485","It‚Äôs tough because I think the path diagnosis varies among those of us who were diagnosed in adulthood. I also never considered adhd... ever. I went to weekly counseling and my therapist observed that my anxiety wasn‚Äôt managed well with current meds. We tried practicing self-calming techniques and she noticed that I struggled to focus. It was completely by accident. She shared with me some one page questionnaires to have a family member and a close friend complete and return to her. I did the questionnaire too. Once she had those all returned, she shared them along with her own observational notes to a psychologist at the office and they confirmed adhd. 

I would suggest bringing it up with your primary or a therapist who you see regularly and have a rapport with. Check out adda.org and [this article from Understood](https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/child-learning-disabilities/add-adhd/how-adhd-is-diagnosed-after-high-school)  (the website is school-aged-based, but it has great resources!)","ed4u7yb",1,1546496476,"2019-01-03 06:21:16"

"2491","Absolutely! One of my biggest strengths (and also one of the biggest reasons I have anxiety leaving the home), is my ability to notice every single thing going on around me at one time. Advantages being I can read a room like no other, when I'm bored I can eaves drop easily by just looking at body language (hehe), and I could also spot a dangerous situation before someone without ADHD. Especially being a woman living in a big city, unfortunately you have to constantly be on guard, so it's helpful that i can't psychically not be on guard lol. 
Disadvantages are pretty much the same thing, just depends on the day. Not being able to concentrate on who I'm with when I'm out in public because I'm so overwhelmed by everything else, and also noticing every sad person or noticing that someone is being rude to someone else etc...those things cause me a great deal of anxiety, but my meds are helping with that.","doqcwoa",6,1508697527,"2017-10-22 18:38:47"
"2492","Most likely an unpopular opinion within this subreddit but I feel like people lean on their ADHD too much and use it as an excuse for various things. Like hurr durr my adhd this my adhd that. Fuck your adhd and learn to live with it.

I myself suffer from adhd and it has definitely made my life difficult. I struggled massively throughout school and was constantly in trouble and the struggle continued in college, not because I wasn't smart enough but because the material and path I chose was not for me and it wasn't stimulating me so I couldn't apply myself to it. It would have continued through university but I started doing a lot of self reflection and realised that the path I was going down was not the right one for me and my personality/brain type.

Which brings me to my main point, you need to identify your weaknesses and figure out systems to support them, because nobody else is going to do that and using adhd as an excuse just isn't going to cut it in the adult world.

I am now considered ""successful"" and doing quite well for myself since I changed the path I was going down and the way I go about my life. So despite my adhd, I have gone on to be more ""successful"" than the teachers who told me I'd never amount to anything in life 10 years ago.

Moral of the story, fuck adhd and figure out how to live with it. Find something that works with your brain and put systems in place to manage your weaknesses, whether that's medication or not, for what it's worth I am not medicated and yes I have terrible days where I get absolutely nothing done, but mostly it is managed and those days are not detrimental to me because overall I have my shit together. At work I live with a to do list on my desk that I'm constantly looking at and managing, I have a reminder on my phone to review the list every morning and every afternoon after lunch - it's just little things like this that you need to do.","fz693ca",2,1595657716,"2020-07-25 06:15:16"

I just have such a strong urge to talk all the time, I want to call or text or talk to people all the time, and it is so hard to keep that under control. I was that annoying kid in class that was always raising their hand, guessing at the answer, because I couldn't control the urge to say the first thing that came into my mind.

"2507","It seems to me that you've always had some self issues that needed to be addressed, and it took some serious emotional trauma along with drug use to cause them to need to be IMMEDIATELY addressed. 

To give you some commiseration...that fucking blows. Sorry about your mom. Sorry you feel so unworthy of graduating and your girlfriend. ADHD blows, but sometimes life just blows too, so it gets even harder to cope.

To give you some advice, graduate like a fuckin' boss. Because although you needed a little help to cross the finish line this time, you still put in years of work and you are still going to do some work to get there. You really did earn it. You invested in yourself, you're an educated man with a degree to show it. You didn't give up and leave when you were at your worst, that's really something. I'm proud of you, really.

Another piece of advice: A therapist may be able to help you reach self-understanding and peace. Sometimes, we get stuck in our own pit of failure and loathing - and although we try our best to self-address our negative feelings about ourselves (or sometimes ignore them and think it's not a big deal), there comes a point where a professional mind-sorter can help you get the pieces in the right place and begin to love yourself and know that you deserve the good things in life.

"2508","Mildly triggered at classical being called 'background music'... But, I would suggest the explanation is that you like Black Sabbath, and don't like classical!  

I listen to classical myself, but that's because I get off on that stuff. I also like a lot of pop music.. Part of it is familiarity, and the other is enjoyment. If I'm listening to something I'm too fascinated with, I can't focus. This would usually be unfamiliar music that I *do* enjoy. If I listen to something awful, I'll keep thinking how much I wish it'd stop. This would be (also) unfamiliar music that I *don't* enjoy. So, it must be both familiar, and enjoyable.

"2529","TLDR: my favorite ADHD friendly exercise, one I don‚Äôt see recommended often, is indoor rowing on a machine. Give it a try once.

My recommendation, from someone who hates team sports, tolerates running, loves walking but always finds excuses not to (esp. in winter), hates the elliptical, and doesn‚Äôt know the first thing about weightlifting, my gold-star ADHD-friendly exercise is rowing on a rowing machine. 
* It‚Äôs low impact, so it has the appeal of easy on your joints. 
* It uses most of your large muscle groups, so you‚Äôll work out your legs, arms, core, chest, and back. 
* It‚Äôs resistance/strength training, and cardio. 
* It‚Äôs a pretty easy sequence of movements, and it feels like I‚Äôm using my full potential (vs. not even fully extending my legs - looking at you, elliptical). 
* Since I‚Äôm using my whole body I don‚Äôt really get the chance to be bored or wander off.


I‚Äôve gotten wireless earbuds so I connect to my iPad, put on a 22 min sitcom, and row til it‚Äôs over. If I‚Äôm tired, I slow my pace. If I want to go hard, I increase my pace or turn up the resistance. Plus, it folds in half so I can store it vertically mostly out of the way. I love it.

I feel like the rower has good economy of activity, i.e. using the most muscles at a time; because it‚Äôs hard enough to convince myself to workout to begin with, I might as well work out ALL THE MUSCLES.

Rowers can come pretty cheap too. It ain‚Äôt a Peloton.

Edit: forgot to mention I threw out my back so bad last week I couldn‚Äôt stand upright without assistance. After a few days of muscle relaxers I felt about 80% better but was still having spasms. I started rowing once a day three days ago and I‚Äôm literally back 100%. I thought it would KILL but it went away!!","gefbo4n",2,1606949292,"2020-12-02 22:48:12"

"2532","Dude, relax.  Basically, ADHD is messing up your point of view by making the problem seem more important and immediate than it is.  Think of it like a game.  If your school life was somehow turned into a role playing game, what would your first move be to get the girl you want?  Remember, you can't make the world disappear.  There are other players out there trying to get the same girl so your tactics have to be good and you need to pick a chick worth your time and effort.  No one wants to grind forever to get a ""so-so"" reward.

High school girls are pretty simple to understand.  They like people they are attracted to just like you, they are as awkward and weird as you and they are all growing up too.  So don't give them or the things they do and say much importance.  They are trying to figure it out too.

All you need to do is focus on yourself.  Hit the gym more.  You say you need to drop a few, so do it.  And while your at it, pack on a few of muscle.  Make friends with the guys who get the girls you like, you'll get them interested in you by association.  If you have trouble making friends, learn more about it.  It's just like hitting the gym, it takes hard work and effort to get results.

Bottom line, there's nothing missing but a little effort and understanding.  Don't get caught up in the moment.  Snap yourself out of the situation, use that brain of yours to understand how to deal with it better and get back in there and makes some improvements.  Be patient and give yourself a chance to make something happen through honest effort.  The world is not going to come crashing down anytime soon.

Mainly the reason I smoke is because I have insomnia that is aggravated by the dexedrine I'm on, and I'd rather not take the ativan my doc prescribed me for sleep all the time when I could smoke medicinal grade cannabis, plus, it helps me eat when the dexedrine takes away my appetite.

"2563","I do the same thing, even as a man. One thing that I always try to keep in mind is that ADHD is always about context. because in our natural state we have very little control over where our mind wanders,  the environment we are in is very important to our success.   


When you're a kid in school, there is a teacher, who is talking to the class. If I had a good relationship with the teacher, or the subject matter was interesting, I did very well.  But I had a few very disorganized teachers, and they made things much more difficult.   


In adult life, you don't have the same environment. You have many additional responsibilities, and you don't have anyone else following up  on you.   


Tests were always my favorite thing. The additional pressure always made me think more clearly.  But 99% of the time adult life is at the speed you schedule yourself.  Its not about the sprint its about the marathon. (where as, before university, you can do very well by just doing the most important stuff)   


  
We don't do marathon thinking very well, because we will lose focus once the novelty wears off. But when you're a student, you are always learning new things. each day brings something new to learn, which keeps our interest.  ADHD has been much more limiting in my adult life than it ever was as a child.  Sure I was constantly in trouble with my parents, but most other adults were reasonably impressed by my capability, and would attempt to help when my lack of organization got the best of me.  


Adults don't usually do that for other adults. (which is why I'm so glad my Fianc√©'s brother suffers from it as well. She was the one who always helped him out, and actually understands what my problems are)","g9hd5ne",1,1603232019,"2020-10-20 22:13:39"

"2575","&gt;So many thoughts in my brain ALL of the time and exercise seems to help my focus. 

&gt;2 weeks and now I'm bored of it

Not alone, I've always been told I'm a ""thinker."" That's how my brain works. I pick up a new subject and go full-in on it. After 2-4weeks, I get bored and move on. I've learned an absolute ton in my short life, but I haven't truely mastered a lot of it because of this issue. My sister/dad do it too. This maybe a long post, but I'll say what worked for me.

When it comes to working out, I had the same issue. The major change happened about two years ago when I gamified the gym for myself. 

First, I removed as many barriers to entry and found a gym nearby (had a home gym, couldn't focus enough to use it) that was readily available 24/7.

Second, I made it simple - since I was focusing on strength training, mine is leaned towards that. My goal for year 1 was to go to the gym 30% of days (approximately 120). For a day to count, I had to do 6 sets. That's it, 6 sets. I'd track workout progress using an app (Fitnotes) and have ""focus"" days so Day A would be lower, Day B would be upper, Day C would be accessories (biceps/triceps, etc). I didn't layout specific exercises, I'd do what was available (sometimes the gym is packed) as long as I pushed myself. I know enough about working out (that aforementioned knowledge seeking led me to a degree in sports med) to shape my routines on the fly.

On completion, I'd log it into a Google Form on my phone which used Google Sheets to calculate my monthly score (workout w/ sets &gt; 6 = 1pt, need 10pts per month).

What happened was that I removed the hurdles (""that machine for this exercise is taken"" or ""it's such a long drive,"" ""I don't feel like doing 24 sets""). Aiming low with 6 sets got me *into* the gym. I average 18 sets per visit.

I'm in year 2 and my new target is 40% of days in the year I go to the gym. I'm blowing it away and I'm in the best shape of my life.

TLDr:

- Set an obtainable long term, near term, and short term goal (mine was to go to the gym 30% of days for a year, 10 days in the month, at least 2 days in a week).
- Don't feel you have to follow a workout routine strictly. The key is *getting there*.
- Reframe your mind during workouts, it's not ""I need to do another set"" it's ""I *want* to do another set.""
- Track your progress long term and short term in an easy to do manner, so that you'll follow through. I take a progress pic in the same pose, same place, same clothes on the first of every month.
- Remove as many hurdles --&gt; Gym closer to house/work, gym clothes ready in car, gym that is 24/7, lower requirement (even 6 sets on a tired day is better than no sets, you'll feel accomplished for pushing through it).

On an aside note, this method may not work for people that can't get into the gym this frequently. Many aim for 2 long sessions per week versus 4 short sessions like I do. I find the shorter sessions let me not be exhausted for the rest of the day and they develop a healthy habit of *getting there*. I've had days where I drive to the gym and realize it's my off day .. it was an automatic response.","e3av72a",2,1532972381,"2018-07-30 17:39:41"

I also have a sense that I was also much more creative, and liked life better.

However, without the meds, I couldn't function well enough in the workplace. So, while I miss my (perceived) creativity and joie de vivre, it would probably be a bad country song if I stopped.

This makes matters worse on all fronts. So, lately I have just been making an extra effort to not let it get to me, to just say, I'm not perfect and I make mistake and there's no reason to dwell on it. 

One tool I find is very helpful is I document just about everything I do, send emails for every action or keep a log that I tell people they can access at any time. Usually I'm able to shift the blame of the issues to others which works well but it's just those small slip ups that people with our personality tend to overly self analyze and it ends up tearing us apart. 

Everyone makes mistakes, even people that don't have ADHD. The difference is that I think we are significantly more capable of handling chaotic environments because we can think of everything but that doesn't mean we will get it right all the time.

I think it's part of the US culture /ideology, and I think it puts unnecessary pressure on the vast majority of people who are just normal folks and have diverse interests and talents. It's a trend over here in Europe, too. I like individualism, but when it becomes forced, it is the opposite of true individualism. If someone searches for their passion and just doesn't find anything, then that's fine and they don't lack anything. Just because you have been given a passion for programming doesn't mean that everyone else has been given something similar. I've dabbled into programming myself and found it very rewarding and enjoyable, but I would miss so much the other things that I also find rewarding and important if I focused on programming now. I doubt that I have the right brain to ever choose one passion, and I think that in fact, most people are like that. ","dsnqy5f",2,1515922026,"2018-01-14 09:27:06"

"2603","Ok. When I first started meds, I had this issue as well. I eventually realized they are not a fix-all. They are helpers. They help me focus and concentrate - when I redirect my focus. They don't just do it all for me. I can take my meds and still end up totally focused on reddit for a day if I don't make myself open my work up and start on it. The difference the meds make is that I don't have to fight myself to open the work and stay focused on it - the meds enable me to just do it when I tell myself to do it.  

I spent years not knowing how to focus on things, concentrate properly, or even just open my work and start working. I spent years fighting myself constantly to get things done. This entirely distracted me from learning to pick up the new habits that we are supposed to learn.  
This is the reason ADHD is classed as a learning disability. It holds us back from learning things other people learn at the appropriate age. Because we spend our time fighting ourselves. 
So now, you are going to want to be learning new habits. Changing for the better. Learning to study, focus, concentrate, and get things done. You've got to undo years of bad habits and start implementing the ones you need. The meds will allow you to do this and stick to it. That is the purpose they serve.

Treating it medically might not be something you want (they mess with your hormones, which can have a ton of other side effects) unless it's really compromising your ability to function in society. Sounds like it isn't. 
Anti-hairloss pills (propecia and the sorts) inhibit libido in guys as a side-effect. Asking your doc for those could be an option if you're too embarrassed. But read up on the side-effects, it's actually pretty serious stuff. I'd advise against it unless you're desperate, but it is an option.

Other than that, therapy might help you get control over your horniness. And not in the ""learning the discipline to not give in to it""-way that'll only make you horny AND miserable but rather in the ""making it go away when it's not convenient""-way.

"2638","I don't think you're being a dick, and I don't take it personally. As someone who takes medications (Adderall) it's a subject I have a passing familiarity with. As a nursing student, I have direct contact with medications on a regular basis and a lot of contact with therapeutic communication styles and how they relate to both treatment processes and things we can do to help patients comply with their treatment regimens. As I said, we have a different perspective on how to read the information and come to different(ish) conclusions. More on that in a minute.

The only problem I have with what you're saying, is that you're accusing me of spreading false information as you acknowledge that Dextrometh is a refined, chemically, and structurally specific substance, that occurs in the street version of the drug but is different in the prescription variant used.

You're suggesting that they're the same thing, I'm telling you, that from a pharmacological perspective, they're different, and sufficiently different that it's relevant to the discussion of the substance in question. The use of enantiomers is very common, and in fact, a number of ADHD related medications use specific proportions of dextro, levo, and racemic levels to achieve differing results. And each of those is released under a different specific medication identification.

To your point about my saying Levo is a stronger CNS stimulant, well, big text blocks are a pain in the ass to read on the best of days even with meds and I'm guessing you've got the same skimming problem I have, the direct quote was,

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The removal of the Levomethamphetamine serves to to make the drug more effective as the dextro enantiomer has been shown to have stronger CNS stimulant effects. 

I did not, in fact, mix them up in that instance. And further, I know exactly which studies you're referring to and looked at them for my responses above. The information there, however, is directed at questions of abuse and recreational use which is why the ""high"" is the metric being measured. But just because two substances, when abused, can have a similar (read not identical) effect, does not mean they are the same substance.

As for the question of why dextro is used, it's not because it more easily crosses the blood-brain barrier, it's because dextro is more effective as a CNS stimulant, the removal or lack of levo means the peripheral systems are less affected. The blood-brain barrier crossing is due to the hydrochloride usage. The salt form of the compound dissolves more readily into the bloodstream and is therefore more accessible than the alkaline form.

Okay, so, as it goes with conclusions. You read this stuff and see them as similar enough that you value the idea of ""yes, they're the same, but I'm taking them on Doctor's orders and that's why it's okay. But I should be aware that it can be dangerous."" Which is in fact, a very important and useful perspective. And is part of what my sort of, sit down and chat about your meds, conversation would go over.

I read it as ""they're very similar, but this specific drug has been tested and developed with the intent of treating a specific dysfunction, it is not the same as the stuff on the street."" My intent focuses on the specificity and safety of the medication when used as directed. It's not meant to ignore the safety concern, but it's not my primary focus because in people treating ADHD the risk of abuse is actually significantly lower than the neurotypical population.

As to the metabolic thing, I believe as the substance breaks down, some of it is metabolized as a different form of methamphetamine and some of it is broken into amphetamine, and both are used during the medication's active period to affect neurotransmitter levels in the body. Some of the unmetabolized molecules will be excreted, and some probably will stay in the body for a bit, but not in high enough levels to have a significant effect on neurotransmitter levels before being further metabolized and excreted.","ff46awr",1,1579556484,"2020-01-20 21:41:24"

If you do those every day, you may be surprised at your progress. The trick is to make the steps so small that you don't procrastinate doing them. And I like making a list where I can get the satisfaction of crossing off what I've done. No step is too small to put on the list if it's necessary and is small enough you'll actually do it. The secret to all things that seem overwhelming is to break them into super simple, easy steps over time.

"2688","Historically, I had some limited success in self-medicating my ADHD with MJ, but there was a plethora of side effects that went with it that were less than desirable. (I may have enjoyed them, but they did not help to make me more productive on the things that I needed to be doing). It (along with alcohol as a secondary drug of choice) tended to exacerbate my tendencies toward depression, particularly as effects wore off. IMHO, if you seriously think you have ADHD, those are not the tools for the job; if you think you have depression, those are really things you need to avoid - as much as you may enjoy them.

Mental Troubleshooting 101 tells us that in order to figure out what's up with you, we need to measure some sort of baseline - that means, uncomfortable as it might be, you'll have to put that pipe and that bottle down for a while - expect it to be several months. Let the doctor you're working with see the 'unfiltered you'. That also means being brutally honest with them about how much you are using and when - that's data they need to understand how best to help you.

[I wrote a prior comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/x5zj9/does_anybody_else_have_such_a_hard_time_starting/c5joia5) about how to start doing things; it got enough upvotes that it must not be completely stupid. Maybe you'll find it of some value. Key takeaway - look for small victories.

Another thing: hydration!! This is soo important. Vyvanse is a stimulant and inevitabley causes thirst. Lack of hydration and thirst can have an adverse effect on your appetite. One being, dehydration can cause nausea and that ends up perpetuating the lack of appetite.

So... how did your doctor come to this conclusion?

EDIT: I was referred to her by my regular therapist that soon started to expect ADHD. She and her daughter have ADHD as well, so apart from being the university clinic's specialist for ADHD she's also personally familiar with the topic.

"2704","Warning: Essay incoming! 

After going through a lot of therapy and some really traumatic breakups, there were a few key take aways that helped me change how I behaved during these kinds of situations. I‚Äôm still pretty sensitive, but I don‚Äôt exhibit as many of the anxious attachment style behaviors you described. 

First is realizing that what I am doing is making my emotions someone elses responsibility. I was never going to improve if I kept doing the same thing and getting the same results and just foisting responsibility onto others. It‚Äôs not loving for anyone, but especially not me. 

Second was coming to the realization that most of the time, doing what I wanted (texting, calling, doing something they asked me not to), it never made a single thing better. Not once. But also, and maybe more importantly, that if someone was going to hurt me (cheat, end things, whatever) that I wasn‚Äôt going to stop them by unloading my anxieties, and if anything I might drive them to it. 

Finally, learning about compulsive behaviors and OCD, and how that operates similarly in that each time I feed my anxiety by performing a damaging but (temporarily) soothing behavior, what I‚Äôm actually doing is embedding that anxiety further into my neural pathways. The only way to fix that, just like with OCD is to sit with your fear. It gets better each time. Some things that help when I‚Äôm feeling this way:

* Journaling out all my feelings, sometimes as a letter. Answering things like what am I afraid of? what will happen if I reach out? what if I don‚Äôt? 

* Giving myself an increment of time to wait, and then adding time to that and so on.

* Calling or texting a friend instead

* Doing an activity! With people!


It‚Äôs honestly really, really difficult. The hardest thing I‚Äôve had to do in working on myself by far. But also has made the biggest difference in my life. I feel much more empowered in relationships and worthy of love. I don‚Äôt feel like I need to convince someone to love me or beg someone not to leave me.

Dear god NO! It's not even remotely close to too late. In fact, you're just getting started. You can choose to do whatever your dream is any damn time you want. I know people more than twice your age who are doing things they've always wanted to do... following their dreams. 

When I was diagnosed, I was shocked and sad and .... it sucked. I remember telling my psychiatrist ""Ok, but... I don't WANT to be ADD."" And my experience has been that the more I know about myself, and can adjust myself accordingly the better my chances of actually getting to do and be what I want. Does it still suck? Yes. But, I'm better off knowing and addressing it than not knowing and thrashing around in my life (which, tbh, I still do... just somewhat less).

"2732","My boyfriend of 2.5 years has depression and anxiety that we think is rooted in BPD. (Potentially relevant info: The depression/anxiety have been present in his life for a long time, but the BPD is a relatively recent realization - still have yet to get it diagnosed and we're definitely far from any sort of real treatment for him. My ADHD was also only recently diagnosed and I'm still working on finding an effective medication situation.)

We're still figuring things out ourselves, but we've made it together this long, so we must be doing something right. Here's some general advice I can offer based on lessons I've learned - hopefully it'll be applicable for you too:

- ADHD and BPD are a tough combo. when you date someone with BPD, not only do you need to master your own emotions, but you need to know how to reign theirs in too. it's not easy or fair to be burdened with that much responsibility, but you really have no choice, because BPD is entirely centred around an inability to process and respond to emotions. a big part of responding to a BPD episode is remaining calm, strategizing the way you react, and trying to de-escalate. (there are some articles out there on handling BPD episodes, look some up and find things to try.) you also need to learn what's likely to set them off, and find ways to avoid those things, or handle them carefully to keep emotions from running high. this is all difficult and draining work, but especially so for someone with ADHD, as we also tend to be highly emotional and impulsive. for me, the toughest part is remembering to stop and think about what I say, when my instinct is to just blurt what's on my mind. sometimes I react in ways that I know aren't helpful, but just don't remember, because I'm caught up in the intensity of moment. I make the same mistakes over and over, which is frustrating for both of us. and there's no easy way through that. you just have to keep trying, keep learning, keep improving. 

- if my boyfriend enters an emotional episode, or if I think one is close to starting, I try to stop whatever discussion we're having (as nicely and calmly as possible) and give us each space until he's calm. rationality often flies out the door during a BPD episode, and nothing will improve if you continue to engage or argue during one. pausing can also give you time to assess the situation and decide on the best way to handle things. usually, once he's had enough time on his own to process/think, he realizes he's been irrational or overreactive and then we're able to talk productively.

- I'm not as emotional as he is, but if I'm tired/hungry/stressed/annoyed/whatever, I am susceptible to making snippy remarks without meaning to, which he tends not to take very well. so if I recognize that I'm in a mood like that I might try to avoid talking about anything important/sensitive or that has the potential to get on my nerves. I'm also trying to get in the habit of letting him know when I'm feeling that way, so he can avoid bringing up those topics, or doing things that bother my hypersensitivity to touch/sound.

- basically, both BPD and ADHD tend to involve high emotional sensitivity and low impulse control, which is just a recipe for disaster. one person's intensity can easily set the other off, and when both are in an emotional state it's going to be hard for either to back down, and most likely it'll just keep escalating. so the best approach is to stop the arguments before they begin. try to identify the warning signs in both of you, and when you spot them, slam on the brakes until you're both able to talk calmly.

- when he's upset/anxious about something trivial or untrue, it's not helpful to point out that he's overreacting, or try to tell him the reasons why the thing is trivial/untrue. I'm a very logical person, and my instinct is to reason things out, but that doesn't often work. So now I try to just listen as he rants his feelings out, maybe ask questions to clarify or get more detail, try to understand what he's feeling or what set him off. sometimes by the time he finishes talking he'll realize it wasn't a big deal, or at the very least feel better after having gotten it off his chest. and, once again, when he's back to feeling calm, that's when we can discuss things productively and I'll have better luck in pointing out the triviality/falsity.

- when he's specifically upset about something I did, I find it's best to default to an apologetic response. in the context of ADHD, it's easier to train yourself into a consistent/automatic habit rather than one you have to stop and think about. so just get in the habit of saying ""I'm sorry"" so that you can reduce the chance of reacting angrily or defensively and escalating. if the thing I did really was out of line, then of course that's appropriate, and I can then proceed to begging forgiveness. if it wasn't, it's still better to respond apologetically, or at least not refute the accusation, because, as mentioned, he may not see reason and I don't want to escalate things. once he's calm again, he might realize he was overreacting and tell me so, or I'll try to present my side of things and explain why I don't think I was in the wrong.

- sometimes his overreactions are because he perceives my comments or suggestions as harsh/judgmental criticism. (it's kind of silly, but one of our biggest ongoing issues is that he doesn't wash dishes very carefully, and gets upset when I point out things that aren't fully clean, or even when he notices me double-checking dishes he's washed.) so I'm learning to preface that sort of thing with an explicit statement that I'm not upset with him or passing judgment, and only trying to be helpful. 

- if my attention is wandering/jumping, or if I'm in hyperfocus, it can feel to him like I'm ignoring him. and of course if I'm distracted I may not notice right away if it's upsetting him. so I've asked him to get my attention and let me know when he really needs me to listen to what he's saying.

- when he gets upset with me, he sometimes says things he doesn't really mean. despite knowing this, it's not nice hearing them, and it's easy for me to take it to heart and feel bad about them. when things calm down, I always feel better when I make a point to ask him about certain things he said and whether or not there was truth to them. 

- but, on the other side of that coin, you can't fall into assuming that everything he says in the heat of emotion is baseless. you've got to be willing to accept critiques and make changes in response to them. there's also a chance that, even if he did mean something that he said, afterward he'll say that he didn't. because once an angry episode ends, damage control begins, and if someone with BPD is afraid of losing someone they'll say or do anything to keep them from leaving. 

- and on that note... I don't want to freak you out, but just a warning: sometimes BPD can make a person lie compulsively. maybe small, harmless things. maybe bigger things. especially if they're worried that the truth might be upsetting. in this context, it probably means that they're terrified of messing up and losing someone important, and the lie is an impulsive and desperate attempt to make things ok. so if you ever catch him in a lie, stop to consider that it might be related to the BPD, and try to see things from his perspective &amp; get to the root of why he felt he had to lie. (context matters here, of course, so be forgiving/understanding but don't just give him a blind pass!)

- hopefully this isn't getting too personal, but: there can be problems with sex. ADHD can affect a person's sexual behaviour in lots of different ways, and for many, it can include a low sex drive, difficulty getting in the mood, low enjoyment due to distractibility or oversensitive touch, and/or a tendency not to be the one who initiates things. ADHD meds can also have an effect on sex drive sometimes. and for the other person, if their advances are rejected, or if they feel like they're always the one to make the first move, or if it seems their partner isn't enjoying themselves much - well, that's not a great feeling for anyone, and of course it feels worse for someone with BPD. they'll probably internalize it, and think it's their fault in some way. sex is often an issue at SOME point, in any relationship, and the only way to detect &amp; resolve it is with open, honest, and frequent communication on the subject.

- this probably isn't something you've thought about yet, since it's a pretty new relationship, but if there's any chance you two might move in together, you need to start thinking about finances. both ADHD and BPD are infamous for making people terrible at managing money. for me, I manage alright, but for him, it's a pretty dire situation. we're planning to move in together next year, but first we have a lot of work to do in getting him to a stable place and building him better habits. if you're considering moving in together, you need need to take a hard look at your respective skills/habits, because it's better to work on them ahead of time than move in unprepared and run into problems. 

- there's only so much help you can get from strangers on the internet. if you are serious about this relationship, and think it has the potential to go somewhere, don't be afraid to seek couples' counselling. it's not just a last-resort tool for failing marriages - the sooner you intervene in a troubled relationship, the better your chances are of fixing it. individual therapy can help you to understand your disorder in relation to yourself, and couples' therapy will help you understand your disorders in relation to each other. so if you have the resources to do something like that, consider trying it out. my boyfriend and I are hopefully going to start sometime in the next month or so.","dmxcwpi",2,1505260425,"2017-09-12 23:53:45"

"2748","That's interesting because mine said the exact opposite. She wanted to treat the ADHD first, and then see if the anxiety and OCD were actually symptoms of the ADHD that would lessen as the stress of daily management got easier. I don't know if this is at all helpful, but maybe you will notice something similar. I personally have found that the Straterra seems to be helping with my moods and with making unpleasant tasks feel less like I am pulling my fingernails out one by one. I seem to be able to get more done and feel a little less overwhelmed, which I think will probably help with the anxiety (I've only been on it for three weeks, and that three weeks involved abdominal surgery) so it's a little he's to tell if the overall anxiety has gone down at this point). Anyway, not that it will work the same way for you necessarily, but maybe. And if nothing else, if you end up with a stimulant, you might notice a simile improvement in your other symptoms. 

So the Straterra might not work for you, but the prioritizing of treating the ADHD is something to maybe mention, in terms of choosing which symptoms to focus on. And if you have the option, maybe mention it to your other doctor.

There's a lot of talk in this sub about blaming the person or the disease. Again, it's not so black and white. At the end of the day, we are the ones in control of our urges, our behaviors, our impulses, our time management, our self-regulation, etc. Putting off an assignment to play a video game might be an impulse caused by ADHD, but indulging that impulse is a decision every person can control. 

It's tempting to create your own ranking of people, but there's no such system of measurement. I would never say ""I'm better"" than someone else, but I might say ""I'm shorter."" :P","cefbpzv",1,1388645960,"2014-01-02 06:59:20"

"2772","I was diagnosed a few years ago and it's certainly improved my life a lot, especially since I work from home so it's extremely hard for me to stay focused and keep a regular routine. I was extremely scared bringing it up to my doctor, but I had reached the breaking point and knew I needed to address it. Fortunately my doctor and the psychiatrist she referred me to were very understanding and immediately recognized the ADHD symptoms.

I wouldn't say being diagnosed and going on meds completely fixed everything, though. Meds only help if you make a serious, determined effort to stick to your schedule and do what you need to do. It makes DOING the actual tasks and staying focused much easier, but it won't make you inherently more organized or motivated. I still have plenty of days where I am completely useless at everything and just can't get my shit together, even on meds.

I can't imagine my life without meds though. I went a week without them recently because I ran out and couldn't get an appointment sooner, and damn it's like everything instantly became 1000x more difficult. I felt slow, dumb, totally disorganized, executing the smallest tasks felt grueling, and all I did was daydream and pace around the house all day. I don't know how i managed to survive those first 25 years without meds, lol.

I will also say that ADHD meds more or less cured my depression, for whatever that's worth. The mood boost is IMO almost as valuable as the focus boost. But that's just my experience.","de309by",7,1487798831,"2017-02-22 21:27:11"

It could take a week or more before you start seeing any effects, it depends on your dose versus the active dose. Also, your doctor might be starting you on a lower dose so your body can adjust slowly and so they might want to increase the dose soon. 
Hang in there. Personally, I hated Strattera, so even though I have a crash on my Dexedrine, I do things to make it a little easier and then put an Out of Order sign on my brain for a few hours. ","e41hoi0",5,1534042811,"2018-08-12 03:00:11"

After all the testing, my results are that I have a high IQ, Anxiety, and ADHD. Unfortunately, I can't start medication yet because I'm still breastfeeding my baby, but I'm going to start working with a psychiatrist soon to control my anxiety, and I'll start working with my therapist to create goals and learn how to cope without medicine until I can get on it.

"2783","I have friends with positive/neutral experiences with Wellbutrin for depression, but IDK about ADHD. My experience was not good.

When I was first diagnosed with ADHD, the doctor put me on Wellbutrin (he was wary of starting with a stimulant/I also have depression) and I had immediate terrible physical side effects. I was constantly dizzy, constantly heard ringing in my ears, and I could expect at least one day a week to be derailed by a headache.  
 I stayed on it because the doctor insisted those were common side effects and that I should persist until at least the 2 month mark. I finally stopped taking it about 1.5 months in. During one afternoon at work a dizzy spell/headache became a full-blown migraine‚Äîwhen I looked out the window the buildings were wiggling and the sun was unbearably bright. I had to turn off all the lights and lie on the ground in agony waiting for my boyfriend to get off work and escort me home because I was afraid I would pass out while waiting for the train. I've NEVER felt that way before, was previously not migraine-prone, etc. I stopped taking Wellbutrin and the migraines, dizziness, and tinnitus went away.","fhcqjw4",1,1581468658,"2020-02-12 00:50:58"

The 2 doctors I saw, a psychologist and my gp only had me fill out questionnaires and never told me what I had and just to try the above meds. 

I know my anxiety is off the charts but I don't want to take the crap they keep giving me, when I mentioned Klonopin he said he doesn't prescribe it because it's controlled.

Congrats on the cleaning! It sounds like you realize you need to figure out how to keep it clean instead of yoyo-ing from clean to omgmessy and back, I seriously recommend the eBook ""Organized for Life"" by Dana Rayburn, I think I paid like $10-15 a few years ago and only ended up doing some of the stuff she recommends, but it's specifically written for ""naturally messy"" people, who do the clean-messy-clean thing and want to keep it at ""decent"" - in the book she talks about how she watched the organized people she knew and figured out what they did to keep their homes so clean without stressing over it, and eventually became the professional organizer that she is now. (She has a blog about ADHD, which is how I found out about the book - I don't remember if she has it too or not but she definitely has done good tips and I actually just hauled out the ebook last week after my apartment got omg messy AGAIN and I decided enough was enough, and I'm now in the middle of the slow, incremental, but less exhausting, process of ACTUALLY organizing my apartment, not just throwing stuff in boxes and hoping I can find it later.

Tl;Dr: congrats, for maintaining mostly clean vs cleaning when you can't stand the mess, check out Dana Rayburn's ADHD blog / Organized for Life (eBook fornkessy people cleaning), used to do some of the stuff in it and it helped, now rereading and actually following the rest and and seeing more results.

Albeit having depression when I was younger (a few suicidal thoughts) and what not I don't actually consider myself to be suffering from depression. I do enjoy life even when my anxiety is there. Social anxiety is only sometimes an issue for me but very rarely, it usually manifests with my best friend and if she is mad at me or a girl I like and if I feel like I did something that messed everything up, sometimes I worry that I may come off as weird but for the most part, I still consider myself eccentric and am proud of it. I do have anxiety meds but due to a coach I have learnt ways to calm my anxiety, with relaxation techniques rather than with the medication. ADHD aside, I dont want to rely on medication for my anxiety, I would much rather control it with meditation and relaxation techniques.

If interested in the meditation, look up mindfulness cognitive therapy, this has been backed by actual psychology to help people not relapse with depression and anxiety.

After school, when I collude read books at my leisure, I fell into the bad habit of starting a book very strong, and then something would come up and throw me off course. I would try to pick it up again a few times, but never at the previous pace until eventually the book just gathered dust if I even started it at all. 

My solution might not work well for you guys it seems. I subscribed to audible nearly a year ago and have listened to so many books. Even long boring ones have been no match for me. I have over a month of listening time, almost 1,000 hours. It has really been one of the best things I've ever done. 

Edit: to answer the actual question, I think I retain about as much or more. Certainly more than if I had not read the book at all, obviously. Reading or listening, sometimes I know the information is in there, but I can't access it without googling relevant information though. It's the difference between having a stack of books that you don't know at all, and having the same stack, which you have a mental glossary of to at least know which book and where to find it physically (not not mentally, as I said)","cuujqb9",2,1441729671,"2015-09-08 16:27:51"

"2826","Finding a new doctor is free there is/has never been a cost associated with finding a new doctors, get used to the labs they are needed and both a protection for the doctor and for you, When you are on a controlled substance of any type it is illegal to take any non-prescribed controlled substances (if you don't have legal or rec pot and use dose pot like many with ADHD they have to take you off it, remember there are technically zero studies that show anything at all because the law prevents the studies, so anything is considered anecdotal and can't be used to render a medical decision or policy change legally.  Also get used to being treated like a criminal that's around to stay, when less then .05% of the population abuses painkillers and a much larger % abuses/lies for adhd meds then everyone pays the price, and they cut a wide sloth (since both are controlled substances many times they shadow harm the other when dealing with one.

Here is the thing where I fall on the spectrum I learned at an early age to learn emotional and reasoning states of others, I know I make people uncomfortable and like many can't always see and recognize the signs, where adhd comes in handy is actually learning things when you figure out how to learn using the distraction mechanisms,  while you have to find whats right for you music while studying helps a lot on the spectrum.  That said I learned that when I look at others point of view it makes things easier, and I will give you a hint here and explain fully in the paragraph below,  Doctors see more and more drug seekers looking for adhd medication for the wrong reasons, when you see BS most of the time you assume BS all the time.  


Some tips, if you have insurance call your insurance and ask for in network psychiatrist specializing in ADHD give them a call. More and more states (and the changing federal law around controlled substances) do require or are about to require regular drug tests, 3 months rolling, is what I've seen a lot and in a group I've been leading the last 2 years that national around ADHD its becoming more and more common, at least a year is to be expected at a min, that said there are some that haven't put it in law and more that have but not taken effect yet, this is what happens any time the govt declares war on anything since war on opiates is the thing now it ends up effecting all controlled substances, and with more and more students taking it when not needed its becoming a turn off for many doctors, and they punish everyone.  


Sorry this is long I deal with this a lot and get many calls/emails a day around this from people needing to vent, hell I;ve gone to the same pharmacy for a very long time they knew me very well and whenever a new person is around I always am made to feel like I'm less then human and abusing things and trying to game the system, my god try to accidentally get your script a day early I had them threaten to report me, or they put it on autofill but because of the dose instruction call into your doctors office 3 days earlier then your doctor would send the script in and get that call from the nurse telling you how bad it is to try to get these early and if it continues they have to 1)cut you off and 2)report you (for drug abuse) even though you didn't even know it happened and you explain that but they have to continue to give the speech they have to to cover their ass(from drug enforcement/med boards/insurance/etc.)  


TLDR: Important bits, its free to get a new doctor (and if you have insurance call them and get them to recommend) Develop a thick skin and try to let it go because this is the new normal and is going to get much much much worse.  Doctors are required to 1) let you personally get your files and see them and 2) Have to transfer at your request to any other medical professional and no cost if current and very small cost if there is a long history, and I've been compiling data for about 7 years around this costs from my network and close to 90% of the time its free, since most are easy to send at a push of a button.  There are plenty of good psychiatrists out there that specialize in ADHD and are actually good at picking out the fakers in talk therapy sessions you should be doing at least every three months, but more is better because it can help to have an impartial understanding ear to vent to and many of them will only give responses when asked for them because again they understand how we work and sometimes you need to dump and move","f8v0r9u",1,1574854619,"2019-11-27 11:36:59"

At my school the professors are not allowed to know what disability you have only what accommodations you need. The access center writes a letter of accommodation which I hand to the professor. My accommodations were suggested by a doctor and put in place by the school. The school didn't come up with the accommodations.   Most if not all US schools have some sort of access center or disability office. It sounds like your school is doing something funky.

Wunderlist has reminders, subtasks, folders etc. Recently wifey got on it and we have a shared list. With my recent ADHD diagnosis she now helps me prioritise by putting on our shared list the things I absolutely need to do. We agreed not more than 3.

Helps her not to have to nag me (the app does it for her), and me to feel accountable in a less stressful way. 

I am staying away from pen and paper as much as possible. I sometimes fall back into post its but I am getting better at turning them into a Wunderlist item. Took me months to get here. 

I have a routine where I associate Wunderlist with meals. Every time I sit down for a meal, I have to look at my Wunderlist first. 

I still miss things and don't do them. But a bit less than if I had no system in place.

"2839","That's fanastic! You're so right. I just learned this lesson about 2 hours ago. 

I just had an absolutely humiliating experience with a family med doc. I'd been seeing a psych for 2 years and never realized how awesome that psych doc was until I moved away and saw this new GP doc. After only filling part of my script (I take long and then a shor acting, he only filled long acting) during the first visit with GP (I was sort of bummed but understood that the GP doc needed to build trust in me, despite the fact that I brought documentation from my psych and didn't need med refills right away) I went back for my next visit over a month later to GP to hopefully get it all filled and GP said he didn't feel comfortable giving an adult a short acting after a long acting and said I should go to my back to my psych for the short. He also said he's never seen anyone on that much medicine in his 35 years of practice (Mayo Clinic says ""the dose is usually not more than 60mg per day"" I'm 54mg/day with long acting and 64mg/day with long and short together) At this point I felt ashamed and I asked if I should just transfer care back to the psych for the long and short acting (b/c why would I see two diff docs for diff versions of the same med? To me that screams 'suspicious activity') and he said something like 'yes' or 'that'd be best' and left the room. I left the room stunned and the nurse said I would get my copay back (I guess he fired me as a patient?!?! What if I just need lab work done or abx for a sinus infection in the future?). I've been crying off and on since then. Now I'm going to have to drive 1h 45min (one way) to see my psych and take time out of work/class.

I am on Strattera and it's working for me, but its entirely different from stimulants. You need to build it up slowly and take it regularly. First month is all side effects, you should feel positive effects after a month, and reach max. Effect after three months.

You should feel more stable, more alert or present, a better sense of self, more (self)-control, and ability to learn (ie. Not make the exact same mistakes again and again). It wont motivate you or give you a boost like stimulants do, aside from a short period of euphoria as it builds up. If it works, its a good time to start some form of therapy to get rid of bad (ADHD)-habits, as these wont magically disappear unfortunately...

Side effects can be light-headedness, hot flashes, racing heart, but those should come and go within the first month. Urigenital problems might persist, but can be managed with the proper dosage, diet and lifestyle.","e8hcpwz",2,1540550943,"2018-10-26 10:49:03"

 I also had headaches when I was on IR Ritalin. In hindsight I think they may have been hunger headaches - this was when I was a kid and didn't really understand that these drugs I was taking were making me not get hungry when I should be. Make sure you get enough to eat even if you don't feel hungry at mealtimes.

It's also possible that your dose is simply too high. I currently take 10 mg of Adderall twice a day, which is *very* low compared to what some people here take, but it works well enough and I have very few side effects.","c708nml",1,1352740309,"2012-11-12 17:11:49"

"2893","I know that the manufacture says that the er version is supposed to last 24 hours, but it rarely does for most people. It's also really possible that the dose is too low for it to be effective for that entire period of time. I don't know what the release rate for the er version is but the rate of release could be part of the problem. Common release set ups are 40% instant release then 60% slow release, 30% instant release and 70% slow release, or 100% slow release. Metabolism also plays a huge role in how long any medication is potent enough to be effective before it's not at a high enough dose to be work. Kind of like a half life. 

*What time do you take it in the morning? When I used to take methylphenidate around 6-7am, it's on it's last legs by 2-3 in the afternoon. Maybe try taking an ir pill in the afternoon? That seems to be a pretty common solution to the pill wearing off too soon. 

*ER methylphenidate costs quite a bit more than the IR version so it might be worth seeing how just taking the IR a few times a day works for you. Goodrx has 10mg IR, 90 tablets for 1/2 what you're paying now. That's taking it 3 times a day too.  ","d86nqun",1,1475136363,"2016-09-29 08:06:03"

"2905","&gt;i usually have a very alkaline diet

*How?*

You don't actually have to give a Grown-Ups And Food 101 or anything... I just have it fixed in my mind that the most straightforward route to an alkaline diet is to eat vegetables plus more vegetables times vegetables. Maybe it is eating alone versus eating with more than one person, but I have learned (after many painful failures) that I can't keep fresh veggies in the house and reliably finish them before they go bad... (Low variety =&gt; boredom, low appetite =&gt; they go bad; high variety =&gt; more to eat =&gt; they go bad.)

If there is a secret -- like all peanut butter is alkaline... or... or a website that covers simple recipes AND simple coordination of those recipes (e.g., putting the two recipes that call for carrots next to each other -- except accounting for all the recipes)...

I am guessing that there isn't anything quite that simple, so you can take this as ""I am impressed in your direction"" too :)","dgr2k9b",1,1493163342,"2017-04-25 23:35:42"

I went off meds for a while because I was going to lose insurance and convinced myself I needed to cope without them. That sent me in a downward spiral I'm still climbing out of. I'm still looking for my right dosage while struggling with a mom who is trying to be understanding but still says some misinformative, ignorant things or stuff she doesn't realize is hurtful.

"2934","OMG. Yeah. I was diagnosed in Germany and the psychiatrist said she'd love to give me the intelligence test but they only had it in German so that wouldn't report a reliable result for me (My German is passable). I was educated in England, and my grades up to 16 were great but everything past there I have failed or dropped out of.

It sucks. Everyone is always like ""But you're intelligent, you'll be fine!"" but it doesn't mean anything if you don't have a qualification to show that. Currently I can't even start a course at a university in Germany because I don't have any internationally recognised 18yo qualifications. I talked my way into uni in the UK (and then dropped out...) but I doubt somehow that will be sufficient here.

I know it's silly to feel jealous of people who have actually worked hard for their qualifications. I don't really resent them for that. I feel crappy that I messed up several shots I've had at it. I'd love to try again with full knowledge/support of my ADHD and see if it made any difference. I feel like I am missing the chance to prove that I can do things. Most people assume that I am educated unless it comes up and then they are really shocked.

I'm not mad at my parents or teachers because where I was there was just simply no way I'd have been recognised as having any disorder. I was just ""lazy"" and ""lacking motivation"" and I assumed for years that I had been coasting because the earlier school years were easy for me and then the later ones actually required me to work and I'd got into bad habits. But with the knowledge I have now, I can look back and see clearly that I found it easier to succeed when the classes and expectations were very structured and paced for me. It was as soon as I was expected to work and plan more independently that it all went to pot. Now - of course - I understand why that happened because *planning is hard for me*. Pacing is hard. I fundamentally don't really understand time. But at the time nobody made the connection.

"2947","Even though I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve ever abused Ritalin, I have occasionally misused it after becoming frustrated with its apparent lack of effectiveness after about 6 weeks. I found myself taking it four or fives times a day, and sometimes would take quite a bit more than prescribed. Unfortunately, such recklessness caused apathy, irritability, excessive daytime tiredness and I constantly fell into full-blown zombie mode. Ironically, it made my ADHD worse after what was a very promising start on the drug.

After a three week break, I now plan to take half of my prescription (2.5-3.75mg) to give my brain a chance to readjust.

2) ginseng tea. I have such a difficult time reading without my meds, and with 300+ pages of reading a week that is unacceptable... this is the only thing that allows me to get it done when I absolutely cannot focus. 
3) routines. Make it a point to keep a clean house. Declutter. I cannot afford to spend time on things laying around, so I try to take care of it immediately. If I dont, it gets so much worse
4) google calendar. I dont remember things 20 minutes from now without my alerts and i check my calendar multiple times a day for assignments due, appointments, classes, etc

college is an easy time to get involved in something like that without a whole lot of effort, but still, if you're even a moderately social person and you surround yourself with people who exercise, you'll probably start to do so as well.

I ended up going to a licensed psychologist which administered several tests which didn't include any family and friends evals or interviews. I don't know why they didn't give you an alternative. I completed a self-report survey! Now I'm diagnosed, but having issues with the meds part. You're not alone! My suggestion: use the counseling center or counseling services if your school provides them as well as the office of disabilities or similar.

"3041","I completely empathize with you, boo. I also have OCD and ADHD, and I've definitely been in your situation before. 

Two things:

One, try to remember, in your darkest moments, that everything is fleeting. You may feel like an anxious wreck right now, but that won't be true in the future. It *feels like* it never ends, but it does and it will. 

Second, when my OCD got so bad I considered suicide, I knew it was time to start medication. And holy shit has it helped. I'm looking to get off it now, which is admittedly it's own thing, but believe me when I say that it has turned down the volume on my obsessive thoughts SO MUCH. I'm a happy person and live a relatively normal life. 

I can remember sitting in an empty foodcourt overlooking the dark ocean one particularly grizzly night, feeling like shit and like nothing was worth it, and there was no escape. I wanted to just walk right off the pier I was looking at and let the ocean do away with me. I saw people living their happy lives and I was just so far removed from it I couldn't wrap my head around it. I felt so unbelievably trapped by my own thoughts I wanted to cry with envy at the ease of these people's lives. 

It was very hard for me to leave the house at the peak of my OCD, I still struggle somewhat, but it's night and day. Before I would mostly not go out, and when I did I would just obsess and feel like shit until I got home. Now I can feel some trepidation about leaving, but once I'm out the door I can just enjoy myself, for the most part. The thoughts are still there, but they pop-up far less frequently, and the volume is much lower. This is all with medication, by the way, no CBT because I can't afford it, but if I could I imagine things would be better even.

Now I'm sitting in my sun-filled office sipping away at my coffee and planning the fun things I'll get to do today. I'm going to take a moment and really try to cement this moment in my head, because I know I'll have dark moments in the future, but it's important to be able to locate a memory that tethers you to feeling good.

They often can maneuver their daily life without glasses, but once they have them, they don't want to miss them. So works medication for us. Once we see the hd-sky version of being able to concentrate and getting our life back we don't want to miss them. The meds are a tool. At least that's how I see it. Maybe they are worried that you won't be able to function without meds anymore. Then the joke's on them, because it probably isn't worse than before.

Bringing one of them to your next appointment could help too. The educated opinion of another professional might just be what they need. I would not recommend having them any part in your medication process or give them any kind of control about it. They could abuse this power if you get another bad day.

"3056","I'll probably say this more than once, but getting a professional diagnosis is important. Knowing what you are dealing with can make a difference in what treatment(s) are available to you.

This video is pretty easy to listen to and to get a good over view of what you may or may not be dealing with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouZrZa5pLXk&amp;feature=youtu.be

This (series), is a bit more difficult, but in no way any less of a resource than the one above: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wWGP8i0mAs-cvY

First time I went in for assessment I was in my early 40's. I was told that I was i the 60th percentile or the ""grey zone"" and couldn't be diagnosed one way or the other. The professional diagnosing me pointed out that I had developed very strong coping skills over my life.

What wasn't taken into account at this time was the damage that having ADD/ADHD had upon my life already. Because this disorder has strong links to the PFC (Pre frontal Cortex),and what aspects of behaviour that are controlled by these regions, I'd always had job and career problems, Which means that I'd always had financial problems i.e. broke all the time and NO CREDIT CARDS FOR ME THANK YOU!. Lastly I'd always had serious issues with being in or getting into intimate relationships (hell I'm still isolated), meaning I'd never started a family, and had few friends.

I respect the work done by this diagnostician, because it was very professional, even if I managed to mask some of the symptoms from detection, and glossed over the long standing impacts that ADD/ADHD had been having on my life. Professional diagnostics are of key importance!

An insurance settlement meant that I was able to go college and this is where the trouble started. I struggled like hell for the past three years. 

Finally this year I got a diagnosis (look up my posts), even if only based upon self reporting documentation, and a few f2f interviews.

It made sense that I'd been able to cope with life as it was muddling along as best I could, but now that I was ramping up the mental work, my ""problem"" was showing up. Plus the reduction/loss of a long standing compensatory behaviour i.e. bike riding, which had an additional effect of reducing symptoms over the majority of my life, meant that I was getting worse by increments.

Now with treatment:

The difference in marks from my last semester course (only one last semester), makes me a believer. I went from 74 - 85 - 94 % across my mid term exams. Now I hope to be able to maintain a b or better while taking on 2 courses a semesters.

I am still adjusting to medication. Recently I had probably the worst vacation because I wasn't able to take my meds (dexamphetamine) with me due to country wide ban. Thailand has a serious meth problem so if you take dex, you have to apply for permission (paper work requests including Dr. letters etc etc.) to take your meds...way too much grief for a two week vacation right? Well I am actually considering it more seriously, or finding alternatives, because I was noticeably off compared to the two previous months that I'd been on medication.

YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary), but getting a professional diagnosis now, at your relatively young age (I'm 50+ now) can still give you a good run at having a successful life career and social wise. GET ON IT!

Good luck","dyu3y7p",1,1526078889,"2018-05-11 22:48:09"

When you go for an evaluation, take a list of the problems you're having. Give examples, for ex, of feeling overwhemed, being unable to concentrate and organize and so on. Do not diagnose yourself or suggest, at this point, what medication you think you need. That's the doctor's job. [They get kind of therritorial about these things.]

"3063","just answered someone elses question so ill copy the answer in 




I do. I've used it pretty hardcore; along with most other substances, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

I've been prescribed various things for ADHD (PI) to be specific, and modafinil has proven to be one of the most effective treatments. Unfortunately it's mostly prescribed off-label, so I actually bought mine through DnM.

Modafinil is amazing. But it has its drawbacks. The best way I can think to describe it in laymans terms is this: Imagine you have a task that you put off every day. Say, for instance there is a pile of clothes on your staircase. So, every day you pass that pile, you think to yourself ""I'll clean that up soon"".

Well, modafinil is no miracle drug. But what I find most effective about it (as a severe ADHD /recovering addict) is that it simply overrides that inner voice. You pop 200mg of legit mod and you just find yourself doing things, things that you've been putting off for days, weeks, months. 

There's no particular reason for it, it just suddenly becomes 100x more enjoyable to complete tasks. So I will offer these words of caution:

1) Buy Modalert 200mg (from sunpharma in india) I have had many types, including legit prescribed provogil from docs, and none compare.  
2) Drink a fuckton of water. Or you will have dry mouth, heachaches (same with every stim med)  
3)BEFORE you take the pill: Write a to-do list of what you would like to achieve when you take it. Because if you don't, you will become 150% fixated on whatever you were doing when it kicks in (last time for me was mortal kombat, spent 8 hours perfecting combos, great but wasn't what i intended) , and will be nigh impossible to break that task and do something else. So, write a plan beforehand, start the first task and when it kicks in you'll sail through it.  
4)Try and avoid social interaction. I'm very social on mod, however you will feel very irritable and like you are wasting your time talking to people if they are not helping you achieve your goal.  

It helps with all of the things you asked about, and Ive never really had a bad day with it.

"3070","I suffered from ADHD for years, but didn't know or understand what it was until very recently and it all clicked. Saw a psych and got diagnosed and medicated. Here's me over my entire adult life and all the ways I'm probably similar to you before I got help:

* Grad student, age 30
* I'm super happy with life
* Extremely confident in my abilities
* I'm great with the ladies--great at chatting, small talk, discussing interesting things about them, banging, etc.
* Never been depressed in my entire life
* Almost never feel ""stressed out"".
* I almost *never* beat myself up about things... except when a truly big failing occurs.
* I don't have trouble ""organizing things"". I write papers that get me A's and A-'s in grad school. The problem is *starting* organizing things...
* I have mostly full organization in my life and I generally know when all my impending deadlines are.
* I'm not ""careless"" at all and I don't make ""careless mistakes"". I was in the military for more than 7 years, and I learned to have ""attention to detail"".
* I don't have any ""general anxiety"" unless there is an immediately pending deadline and I'm having trouble getting my brain to let me work on it.

Some differences from you:

* About disorganization, my room is a mess, because I never organize my papers, mail, documents, books, etc. and just throw them on a table/shelf/couch. It takes a while to get to the point where I feel compelled to do a Big Clean and organize/clean it all up.
* I know I'm impulsive in my choices. When I don't want to do an assignment, I get the impulse to *anything* else and to search out something interesting to do instead. I can also be an impulsive buyer for sure. Pizza, video games, things on Amazon. When it happens, I can *feel* that it's an impulse and I just want to give in. **However,** there aren't actually many things that I *want*, so I don't actually spend too much money on these impulses.
* I also have mild social anxiety. It was significant enough to make me eventually seek a doctor, yet mild enough that I just take blood pressure medicine to handle it (sounds weird, actually a super common thing).
* Aside from pursuit of girls, I don't go out of my way to be social at all. I don't feel the need to seek out friends or go to a lot of social functions. I don't care about small talk, and only do it so much because I know it's socially expected.

Some of these things changed massively on medication, especially the social aspect. Now that I'm on Vyvanse for ADHD, I've had totally unexpected alleviation of ***ALL*** my social anxiety. Literally all of it. On top of that, I now seek out social interactions and find small talk actually *interesting and fun* like I imagine normal people do. And a lot more.","d9x9j93",6,1478966995,"2016-11-12 16:09:55"

"3110","I understand completely.   I am a freelance illustrator.   When I have a client with a deadline I'm OK, but if I'm drawing stock art or something that I have to choose to do and then put up for sale on a stock website,  that's where it all falls apart.   Without a boss to judge me,  or a client to hold me accountable,  it goes to shit really quickly.   I procrastinate on everything,  while somehow still deluding myself that I'm being productive.   Like,  part of being a graphic artist is looking at art and what other people are doing,  keeping up with trends,  filling your brain with inspiration.   But that doesn't mean that spending 40 hours in a week on Pinterest looking at art is productive,  but it feels like I'm accomplishing something.   Or I'll be unable to ignore the fact that I haven't done the dishes yet and I won't be able to work until I go do that.  And then when I'm in the kitchen I'll see something else that I need to do.  Working from home is *hard*.   Even without kids.   At least during the summer I can blame my distractedness on *them*,  but when they're at school I'm equally distracted,  it just comes from an internal place instead of externally.  

I'm not really sure what to suggest.  You could try writing in a coffee shop or somewhere outside of home,  somewhere you could equate with ""work"",  where you immediately get into a productive mindset.    But I don't take my own advice,   I can only draw when I'm surrounded by my own things at my own computer.  

I'm lucky that my husband is supportive and makes a good salary,  but still... it's a hardship when I don't pull my weight and help pay the bills.   Sometimes I think I'd be better at almost anything else,  being a cashier at the grocery store for minimum wage feels like it would be more productive than what I am doing right now.

It'll feel like a miracle pill a first, but what you really need to do in the long-run is find a dosage that just gives you a little more focus even though you have tolerance from taking that dosage daily for multiple months. Upping your dosage because you have tolerance and got spoiled is trap. If you get to really high doses, start getting side effects, and have trouble lowering your dose, it'll be problematic. For some people, high doses might be the way to go, but as newly diagnosed person I wouldn't recommend going too high until you really have a chance to introspect on how the stuff affects you in the long term.

"3132","It is very clear that you are struggling with self-confidence. Have you seen a therapist?

You need to love yourself and learn not to use others as a ruler for how it makes you feel. You want to be given attention as a form of validation, but it probably will be short lived. I am saying all these things from experience because I feel like I have gone through what you are going through now.

In the end of the day trying to control things that you cannot (how people see you) is gonna leave you bitter and angry with yourself. Its like trying to be born smarter, without ADHD, being able to fly, etc...Trying to love and care for yourself better (exercise, sleep well, go to therapy, practice some self love atitute/thinking) is what is going to make the difference for you.

Once you really see others reaction to you as a gift that you can accept (or not), and that you ultimately have no control over, you will be able to be in the moment and be the person you want to be. That is how it worked out for me in the end.","dv89rzs",5,1520281412,"2018-03-05 20:23:32"

Many of my instructors would pass out ear plugs in class for exams. Filing for disability is a protection not something to be used against you. It took me 5 years to get my pre-reqs done and I survived nursing school without meds, I do not recommend that. I was poor as hell and did not have the time or money to drive the distance for low income mental health which is sparse in my area. I only slept a few hours a night before clinicals and I had to record lectures and obsessively listen to them since I had little ability to pay attention in class. I also used Quizlet to repeatedly study material. I have the ""get it done yesterday"" version of ADHD but if you have the procrastination version you will have to be on top of yourself. The second I got our semester planner I would plug every single thing I had to do into my phone calendar and set at least 3 different reminders for them. I would finish my homework weeks early if allowed to. I was a total mental train wreck the entire time but I made it through and graduated with high honors. The biggest thing you need to do is figure out yourself and what you do to be your own enemy. While completing my pre requisite courses, which arguably were harder than nursing courses, I learned that if I did not do something the second I was able to I would never get it done. It has to be your entire life, but it's only a few years so think of it that way. Other people were able to have a life and go out and do things, I had to study the same thing 60 times to make it stick, but I did it and so can you.","gjh93mv",2,1610816994,"2021-01-16 17:09:54"

I realized I might have ADD when I was 23 (or 22?). My brother who is about 8 years older than me realized it at the exact same time. He lives hours away, and on a visit to him I happened to mention that I was thinking that I might fit the profile of ADD, and he whipped out his phone to show me that the opened tabs were of him looking up the exact same thing for himself. He went on to be diagnosed and Adderal extended release is working incredible for him. 

I finally, saw my GP, then FINALLY saw a specialist who diagnosed it and gave me meds. I've been on Adderall previously, but I just couldn't get it to work for me - it was always too much or too little.

You have a mental disability, that you right now can't medicate for, because you're pregnant, something that in and of itself wreaks all sorts of havoc with your body and brain, and you are still trying to work full time, take care of a toddler, and keep up with your regular amount of chores. This is not possible, and sooner or later, something has to give. I don't know where you live or what legal or union rights you have but if I were you I would seriously look into extended sick leave for the rest of your pregnancy or at the very least cut down on your work hours. You can't do it all, it's just not possible, *everyone* has their limitations, and you *have to respect them* or you are going to burn yourself out like a match. 

Please, for the sake of your health, both mentally and physically, and the sake of your coming baby and the one you already have, stop trying to hard to do everything you think you should be able to do, and simply take care of yourself instead.

I know it can be hard to let go of the idea that ""everyone else can do this so I should also be able to"" but you really need to stop thinking like that because it doesn't lead to any place good. Remember that for most people, all you see are the facades they put forth, you do not get to see their hidden flaws and personal failures like the ones you see in yourself.

I awoke at around 4 a.m. (it took some time for me to get up &amp; showered - the hot water helped), took my meds early, and pretty much plowed through my report until I absolutely had to finish up &amp; send it out (around 1430).

By the time the second alarm goes off, your meds will have kicked in, your mind will be more engaged by that time, and it should be MUCH easier to get out of bed. I throw a caffeine pill in there along with my med, too. Man, I can't tell you how much this has helped me get up in the morning. ","c4tk9ar",7,1338273575,"2012-05-29 06:39:35"

"3194","Hypothesis: Having ADHD sets us up to be more inclined to uncommon associations and sideways leaps, so it stands to reasons that you tend to not make the common associations. It's all based in your expectations. Same thing happens to me. I notice extremely subtle jokes like that and even jokes that are unintended but often the obvious ones go right over my head (as an anecdote I was going over an english book with a 5 year old chinese speaking child that happened to involve a snowman. one of the words used to describe the snowman was ""cool"" but I know the pun was accidental because the book included no other puns at all and the level of comprehension the book was meant for was never intended to include puns because 5 year old Chinese children don't typically speak enough english to be able to grasp english-based humor, nor do Chinese speakers in general seem to care much for puns, their own language being FULL OF HOMONYMS so puns are not very impressive to them). Also utterly deaf to sarcasm but I get dry humor, which is weird because sarcasm should be easy to detect given the sardonic tone with which it's usually expressed, while dry humor is more often just an implausible statement said in a normal tone of voice.

"3198","I don't know anything about Modafinil, but actual stimulants often require some adjustment time. Your brain accommodates itself to the drug to some degree, reducing certain side effects, and your mind finds ways to cope with the remaining ones.

Normal cognitive decline across one's 50s and 60s tends to make even normal people a bit ADHD, and worsens the symptoms of those who have it, so this is a good time to try out some options.

Late diagnosis entails a mourning phase for an unknowable amount of lost potential. A lot of anger tends to be involved. A few months of off and on anger in my case, but one gets through these things.

Drug treatments can have some unpredictable effects, though, and annoying mixtures of really good and really bad ones, such that it takes a while to figure out what's worth staying with. But drugs are THE treatment. Exercise, sufficient sleep, a good diet, meditation, supplements, life coaching etc. are all great, and combining them can reduce symptoms imprssively, but it's a combo that's near impossible to hold together if you have severe ADHD.","cpwdheu",2,1427777412,"2015-03-31 04:50:12"

Vyvanse lasts around 10-12h wich might not be the best thing for your sleep and appetite, it also shuts out all your regular coping mechanisms that worked to calm you down and make you happier off without medication, from personal experience with anxiety and being on a low dose of concerta (long acting mph) I can tell you that it can be hell, I wasn't able to get out of my anxiety mind the way I do on other meds, which is by concentrating on something else, and I wasn't able to get out of my anxiety mind by distracting myself which is my coping mechanism for when I'm not medicated, I tried a higher dose but it was still exhausting and bad for my mental state, having those times in the day where I'm just unmedicated is necessary for me, I now take meds that last 5h with an optional second dose at lunchtime depending on what I have to get done in the afternoon, something like that may be a better solution for you as well","fvmadcg",1,1592813859,"2020-06-22 08:17:39"

"3235","Well, if you think about it, dopamine is built from amino acids. What you just described gives you plenty of that. As well, your meal plan is also light on your digestive system, so it doesn't slow-down absorption. None of the food you described is terribly acidic, either, which greatly influences how well amphetamine is absorbed from the digestive tract. Water is good, as it bumps-down your stomach pH, it moves food through the digestive tract, and of course, dehydration is one of ADD's worst enemies (just adds another layer of mental sluggishness and inattentiveness). 

I also notice that exercise will basically speed-up the duration of adderall's effects. I stopped exercising in the mornings because when I did, it sped-up the ""window"" in which adderall was most effective -- instead of having 8-10 hours of effectiveness, the window shrank to 6. Like you said, it's a great way to ""work it out"" of your system at the end of the day. 

They say that routine and structure are an ADD'ers best friend. I think this is true, in part, because it keeps the effective dose consistent. If you aren't watching your diet, you don't get the most from the meds. If you aren't sleeping well, it counteracts your meds, and promotes co-stimulant usage (e.g. caffeine).

The only #s I found were from the [US Deparmtent of Education 2009](http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pdf/studies/2011462.pdf?_ga=1.239818315.931572072.1438358434) which states the average GPA is a 3.0. No standard deviation given, and they do not account for weighted GPAs.

I'd be pretty curious to see who is doing a nationwide study of this, and accounting for the various ways individual high schools weight GPAs.","cxl9fzm",1,1449113739,"2015-12-03 03:35:39"
"3257","Through the awkward power of using twitter as my public brain diary/outside therapy behavioral intervention journal thingy, I was able to finally organize the the 9 (soon to be 10) medications/vitamins both in a physical container and on a timetable for when fall semester starts up again. 

Now I need to figure out whether or not I should buy a binder for every class. Does the sun damage those cheaper plastic/cardboard binders? What about if I left them in a hot car? I go to a CC so realistically I would store all my excess binders in my car instead of lugging them around campus/class without a big enough bag to hold them. 

I also plan to put a cooler (already bought one) in my car too to hold drinks and foods for my specific dietary needs. On Tuesdays and maybe everyday I am thinking of staying on campus from 8AM (or 11AM if I don't go to campus early on days besides tuesdays) to 8PM. Does that sound overkill? On Tuesdays and Thursdays my last ends at 4:30PM. I would then spend my time in the library till it closes at 8PM. If I take breaks in the library then I should be fine right? 

At least I now have two/three dedicated areas on campus that I will be able to study/do assignments well. The quiet area near the faculty offices, The disability computer lab, and outside when the weather is no longer unbearable hot. 

The challenge of this semester will successfully completing two courses for my degree. This is the only semester I will get to do these courses. I already failed one of them thrice (W in spring, F in summer, now it's fall) and I have to take it online so I will need to cope, strategize, and execute to at least pass the class or it is game over for my transfer degree and a part of my soul would be ripped away permanently lol..... The other class is for a second transfer degree I am pursuing. This is a speech class with a professor whom I already had two other classes with (earned low As but I did notice I procrastinated and did speeches/essays at the last minute and did not utilize/practice actual study skills to succeed in those classes). What concerns me about this class is that it is an argumentation and debate and I have always been naturally anxious about public speaking even though it has captured my interest at the same time. My recent previous class with this professor was group communications so 2 of three speeches were group speeches. I hope I will be able to step up to the plate an actually practice ahead on solo speeches now that I am actually medicated...  If I somehow failed this class, then that would mean I lose out on my second transfer degree because the class is not available in the spring. 

Then comes the iffy classes. I wanted to take pre calc and a support class along with a human anatomy class. This would mean taking 14 units along with the speech class. However, since I failed my summer class, I will now be taking 17 units. I have been advised by two counselors that I should be weary about taking so many hard units. Ultimately both counselors always seem to say it is really up to me on whether or not I choose to continue with 17 units. The one  saving grace about this is that there is fortunately a census date where I can get a refund if I decide the class isn't for me..... However, I do not know if the books I rent from amazon would be allowed a refund then. I would realistically and sadly need to drop math over anatomy because my parents have pressured me to take anatomy and a part of me wants to take it to. Even though I like the professor who is going to teach math, I have been told time and time again that precal is not really necessary in my field that I am not even 100% sure I want to go into. My counterargument to that claim is that if I ever (unlikely but maybe) wanted to go into higher level statistical/psychology/research-based courses, I would need a strong fundamental math foundation of not just stats but of the very least precal to be able to learn calculus..... and now I see that I have rambled out a long post... this is probably what it feels like when my professors suddenly get long ass emails from me. 

The strange thing is I only really started to send long emails when I started treatment for ADHD... wonder what that could mean, if anything.","evrzwms",1,1564724179,"2019-08-02 05:36:19"
"3258","As a nurse I often have patients that need to follow difficult diets as diabetics or heart healthy. I often hear very caring spouses talk about preparing separate meals or snacks in a very sincere effort to support the person. While helpful it can also be difficult to maintain as well as isolating to the individual. Truthfully a diabetic diet is healthy for the healthy so we all should be eating that way anyway.  
     The things that are needed by someone with adhd (routines, lists, exercise, calenders, and good sleep hygiene) are healthy habits for most folks. As you educate yourself about what an ADHDer needs, integrate the concepts for yourself. It‚Äôs easier to support someone when you understand how hard a habit is to form.

He had/has AHDH pretty bad. He would take a pill in the morning and again at lunch (lower dose) as a booster.

His classmates were like ????? but it was all good. It was an advanced class and the kids were awesome about it.  He and I had a chat later about like ""You know how we're not laughing at you, but with you, right?"" He said, ""I know!! I practiced when to tell a joke with the right social timing!

Let you know where you stand and tell you what you could use improvement on and don't just assume it. **Ask for an honest evaluation because you're not sure where you are or need to be.**

I say this because it may *really* help to hear an outside perspective. I won't claim you'll be able to accept any praises, and I won't say it will all be positive. But you need to remember that the brain *instinctually* leans towards negativity because you're programmed to be worried for you. It is NOT an accurate estimator of how good/bad something is/was, especially over time.

You need them to give you that direct outsider's perspective and confess what you're worried about concerning your performance. For multiple reasons...  
\- Nothing feels better than having someone you respect give you a constructive breakdown. That outside contact anchors you into a shared reality outside of your depressed mental state.  
\- Their advice could help you feel better equipped to tackle the next problem while you figure yourself out. A boss would rather you check-in than slowly sink and quit yourself.  
\- And if anything, nothing reassures a good boss like knowing their subordinate *is* worried about their work and wants to do better (instead of slowly giving in). If you're surprised they haven't quit on you, ***find out*** ***why*** because you don't quit on something unless it can't recover.

"3324","Like others have said, i think it comes from the very low lows of failures during our academic years. When I failed my first college classes, they were in the same semester and I can still physically feel the pain I was in from those failures. I remember I had spent a cumulative of 24+ hours studying (over a week) for one of the finals, and got a 36%. It was just such an utter and complete loss that I thought I had done everything right for in preparation and I still failed miserably. But the classes that were specific to my major that used the same concepts, I was able to knock out and pass pretty easily (the two failed classes were calc 3 and physics 2, other classes were applied physics to my field which also used a lot of calc 3 subjects). But I would always tell myself that I only passed those classes because they must‚Äôve been easier overall, or maybe it‚Äôs because I could understand the application better, never that I was just capable of doing this specific type of science. 

Now I have a career in my field and the compound of me having failed classes and working with people that didn‚Äôt, scares the heck out of me. I‚Äôm always worried that if I say I struggle with ANYTHING, I‚Äôm going to be fired for being a fraud.

She also will tell me if my hyperactivity is too much from time to time. It helps keep me in check and I'll have to ground myself and try and calm down. Sometimes it gets so bad that I gotta leave her alone for a bit so I can calm myself down. Although I am very self aware of my symptoms, I still need reminders from time to time when I get too excited.

It's a two way street and you both gotta put in the effort. This doesn't mean nagging each other but just respectfully saying ""hey this is too much, I need some space"" and understanding that. It's not unhealthy for two people to need space and with me and my partner we both understand and respect each other's needs. You also both need to communicate your feelings properly. Learning how to do that effectively and respectfully regarding your relationship takes time, but it is an important skill that will benefit your relationship.

Regular people have enough dopamine, so extra makes them ""smarter""

We don't have enough  so extra makes us normal.

Might be a point you can make with your mom



Also, dont underestimate wellbutrin, it also fixes dopamine to an extent 



Also also, exercise. It doesn't last as long as Ritalin, but if you exercise before you have to study you can get a few hours ""fix"". Unfortunately you can't be expected to go for a run every few hours, but it might help before hw or exams.

My friend has recorded lectures bc covid, so she watches them at double speed right before hw. If you try this, you can group all your boring work together to do right after an exercise.

"3375","Yes, I have self medicated with marijuana extensively, about 3 years total, and sometimes still do despite trying not to. I didnt realize it was self medication until my diagnosis+prescription about a year or two ago.

I want to post a disclaimer; this is mostly anecdote from my own experience of use from the past 4-5 years (longer than 3 due to t-breaks) total. In that time i've consumed marijuana  at rates considered both heavy and casual by other users. I've gone through tolerance breaks ranging from several months to only a few days, and experienced withdrawal symptoms many times. This is what i've learned personally for me in my body in my personal situation; this is not scientific. I resort to this because good research on marijuana effects is very limited. While it is essentially physically-speaking harmless (that headline about periodontal disease; remember that? recent, solid result, large study), i suspect that the reason marijuana has a ""harmless"" reputation, even with chronic consumption of large amounts, is that the mental-health effects are far more subtle than the physical ones, and more difficult to recognize. As someone who has been in mental health treatment and learned a lot more about psychology/neurology/ADHD/and marijuana than i ever expected to, this is my anecdotal non-scientific opinion, i hope you find some of it helpful.

1. stop using synthetic marijuana. No one know what's in that shit, and we may not know the effects of unregulated synths like spice for years and years. We could learn that it causes something like awful neural-degeneration later in life; do you really want to be that science experiment? Do you want to accidentally make your ADHD worse? because this is definitely a spin of that roulette wheel. We all accept our own risks, but as someone in your position; i wouldn't take this risk if i were you.

2. Marijuana can act like a stimulant, pending strain, strength, and tolerance of the user. But marijuana-self-medication has unique side effects that real stimulants don't, that can exacerbate ADHD; short term memory loss, increase in impulsivity (speech, and action), reduction in self-regulation of emotions, motivation loss, and also paradoxically, anxiety. In me i had one more side effect that most don't get, after rapidly ceasing all use after a long, heavy-use period, and then starting up again at heavy levels after a several day abstinance; severe mood disturbance resembling mania.

3. There's also quality control + consistency issues from batch to batch. Maybe you live somewhere like Colorado where this isn't an issue but many don't. When you take a pill every day, it's the same pill. When you buy weed from a dealer or a friend, the strain/strength/quality/chemical bouqet of the weed is *constantly* changing, which means you're *constantly* messing around a little bit with your brain chemistry. In this same vein, you could also be smoking marijuana contaminated with other drugs, or fertilizer, or pesticide. Because it's likely grown illegally, there's no regulation in the kind of farming techniques they may use or the kinds of adulterants that can be added.

4. Marijuana can be addictive (just not in a chemical-way, in a psychological-gratification sort of way, like porn). Recent studies show about 10% of regular marijuana users report having withdrawal symptoms (similar to nicotine withdrawal, funny enough) post-several-day-abstinence, signifying addiction and dependence. and this can make it hard to curb use if one desires. Arguably, a larger issue is that your body's tolerance can get *very* high *very* quickly if you're reckless in your use, meaning you'll need higher doses, with more negative side effects, for the same/diminishing stimulatory effect you used to get. This means at a certain point, it's use as a medicine can become a large negative for a small/vanishing positive.","d4t1csr",3,1467231012,"2016-06-29 20:10:12"

Unfortunately I was also terrible at life had a mental breakdown got sectioned and finally got diagnosed and started taking medication.

Went back to work and it was like it fixed my life problems. Every time they increase my meds I get promoted my salary has literally doubled in 2 years since I started taking medication and I am now about to become a low level manager at school, people at work now highlight the impact I have had instead of highlighting the things I hadn't completed. My social life has also improved as well as I am no longer as impulsive or anxious and most importantly I recently cleaned non compulsory items 3 days before anyone would notice which I am putting as my single greatest achievement in my life.

Stress in of itself is a huge irritator, diet can also have an impact.  Getting upset and being emotional can cause additional stress, only adding to the problem.

If you're feeling stressed, see what you can do to mitigate that.  Meditation helps, it's really difficult for us to do, but even trying can help.  I've heard yoga helps too, it's a lot easier for us to get a handle on that.

"3400","Okay babes, first of all when this happens try to calm down. Happens to me a lot and I can give you an example. In the past I was called schizophrenic by someone who kept lying and they were so manipulative that I would come to a point that ‚Äúoh, shit, did that thing happened?‚Äù and I would search about the disorder all the time. I would ask my mom sometimes if something really happened or am I seeing things. In high school I was told I might‚Äôve had Bipolar disorder rather than ADHD by a doctor who was not careful enough to say this to an overthinking person who was depressed and suicidal. I was lonely, I thought no one understood me, they acted like I was crazy time to time because, you know, ADHD for people who doesn‚Äôt understand wtf lol. I could not see a psychiatrist for months and I fuckin lost my mind. I cried in my band practice one like crazy because they told me we did not practice a song that I was sure we practiced. Just once. They meant we didn‚Äôt practice enough.
So basically it hurts. We overthink, we sometimes are lost in our own world that we might be nowhere to be found. But no, you are not making up things. Just be careful that if that kind of things happens again take your tiMe and think but do NOT OVERTHINK because it might be hard to handle. As you said writing things down helps. Im just here to tell you you are not alone. I sometimes totally lose all of my thoughts. They are just gone. Sometimes I tell people to give me a second because I can‚Äôt respond just because the thoughts in my brain is just extremely fast. Take a second breath and continue talking when the thoughts come back. 
Also since we think so so so much I think we change so much in time because we revaluate our every thought a thousand times. I feel like it might be the reason why we change so much and maybe that reboot you mentioned is because of that.

"3401","For the duration of the illusion, a giant sash is dividing the stage in two parts to show that neither Penn nor Teller ever cross this line at any time during the illusion.  Penn instructs both audience members selected randomly to not cross this sash during the illusion.  I noticed that when Penn presents his ammunition pouch for the audience member to select, there‚Äôs always one round that is sort of almost pulled out of its holder and makes for an easy grab.  I think the pressure of being in front of thousands of people with tend to force people to make simple easy decisions in order to avoid embarrassment and thus, they take the suggested bullet everytime.  

Then I noticed that the audience members are instructed to write their initials on the bullet itself.  After they finish writing on the bullet, the audience never gets another look at the bullet until the conclusion of the trick.  Then the magicians take the round and it is right around here that a very fast sleight of hand occurs and I think the bullet is removed then because Penn instructs the audience members to draw a picture on the casing and then asks the audience member what he wants to draw.  This question feels forced as possibly a stall tactic or some cue to a hidden stage hand attempting to recreate the picture on the casing.  When the audience member draws on their casing, each magician holds the bullet and obscures it from view and I think this is because its either phony or already been removed.  

In an effort to add credibility to this illusion, a stand with a piece of glass is placed in between Penn and Teller to provide the illusion that a bullet has been fired through it when they each fire their guns.  Penn even makes it a point to use the bullet casing to tap on the glass to demonstrate its authenticity.  It may be at this point that he is dropping the bullet into a hidden tube leading back stage and the taps on the glass mask the sounds of the hardened bullet falling down this tube.

When Penn and Teller places the bullet into the cylinder, again, the bullet is not visible and the audience member is instructed to push it the rest of the way in.  

Then the audience members leave the stage and Penn begins a speech explaining the rules of safety on guns.  While he‚Äôs explaining this, he is messing with a backstop that he will stand in front of for the shot.  While he is messing with this backstop, his right hand is briefly obscured from view and a legendary magician like Penn could definitely do some sleight of hand at this point.  

Then Penn and Teller begin to equip their safety equipment including safety glasses, ear plugs, a ballistic helmet, and a bulletproof vest.  I notice that Penn tends to pass the helmet in front of his face while he‚Äôs putting it on and I think its at this point, the bullet is actually placed in his mouth.  Upon examining these brief moments, I noticed that Penn can be seen opening his mouth just a little bit and what looks like his tongue sweeping across his mouth from his left to his right.  Then a half a second later, there is what appears to be another object that sweeps across his mouth from his left to his right.  I think this object is the bullet and at this point in the illusion, Penn and Teller are staring directly at each other so I think that its a nonverbal cue to proceed with the trick.  I feel like these mouth movements are clearer in the actual video but I have stills of these very brief moments here:
http://imgur.com/ohWoOxr
http://imgur.com/WasKYr2
http://imgur.com/gIzBzKb

At some point during the illusion, the bullets have rifling added to them supposedly from the Colt Python .357 barrel and black powder resembling gunshot residue.  I believe that the rifling and powder marks are artificially created by a hidden stage hand.

The moment of the gunshot arrives and Penn yells across the auditorium loudly ‚ÄúEARS‚Äù so that people can cover their ears for the loud gun shots.  A second later, gun shots are heard.  Penn and Teller act in a dramatic fashion that they just caught bullets in the mouth.  The audience members return to the stage and Penn and Teller approach the sash divider and each spit out their bullet into the hand of the audience member that wrote their initials on it.  Then Penn asks the audience member if that was their bullet with their initials on it and the audience member confirms it is.  He then points out the addition of the rifling and powder marks on the round attempting to enhance the illusion of an actual fired bullet.  There‚Äôs just one thing they didn‚Äôt account for.  If you were to somehow catch a bullet in your mouth, the bullet would be too hot to the touch.  A gun shot generates a lot of heat and intense pressure yet as soon as Penn and Teller spit their bullet out into the audience members hands, its absolutely cool to the touch.  

Then Penn opens the cylinder of his gun and shows the audience member the shell casing with his drawing still on it.  He demonstrates that the shell casing has been fired by revealing the activated primer on the bottom of the casing.  I think this may be legitimately provided by the gun but there was no live rounds.

During this illusion, there are never any bullets fired.

The audience members are not stooges in on the illusion and are genuinely selected randomly on the basis that they have some working knowledge of guns.  Penn typically selects police officers, military personnel, and gun club members as his subject matter experts.  Each audience volunteer is given an opportunity to inspect the gun and to make sure that it is in fact a working model with no gimmicks.  The audience member is given a few seconds to confirm the firearm.  They are simply not given enough time to thoroughly inspect the weapon and ensure that it is a working actual firearm.  Further, the audience member is asked to inspect the bullet before writing on it to confirm that it is a real .357 round.  Again, they are only given seconds to inspect it with a tall Penn Gillette towering over them continuing to patter.  Again, there is simply not enough time to fully inspect a round and determine if it is legitimate or not.

The thing that perplexes me the most is the piece of glass.  Like I said, I do not believe any bullet, wax or not, is ever fired during this illusion.  I don‚Äôt think there would be some small explosive charge hidden in the top frame holding the piece of glass that is capable of genuinely making what appears to be bullet holes.  But it may be possible, just something I‚Äôm not aware of.  In multiple versions of this illusion, the piece of glass does not reliably form convincing looking bullet holes.  

When the audience members are told to mark on the bullet, they are given a choice of marker between black, blue, and purple.  When the audience member selects a color, Penn reaches into his coat pocket to retrieve the marker.  This is an absolutely perfect opportunity for a legendary magician to do some slight of hand.  

Penn engages in a lot of patter during this illusion and I think this is so that a hidden assistant can have time to closely reproduce the markings on the bullet from the audience member and apply the forensics (rifling, powder burns).

That‚Äôs all I have.  Penn and Teller are some amazing magicians and I may be completely off track here.  But I‚Äôd really like to know if I‚Äôm on the right track.

My job entails making drinks, helping customers, and doing constant clean up.

This resets the side effect of appetite suppression and makes things worse.  I know some people still lose their appetite even with meds every day, but it definitely helps to take the medication consistently.  Second: as OP mentions, make yourself eat in the morning before meds are active.  It doesn't have to be breakfast food.  Hamburger, brussel sprouts, beans, whatever.  Get some calories and nutrients in your chemical factory.  It is necessary for your human life, and you can't manufacture neurochemicals without food.  Finally, protein is your friend - nuts, beans, cheese, yoghurt, meats, whatever.

There is no reason you need a drug test. Ask him why do you need one. If he tells you that you need it because he needs to control your dose, that's false because the dosage of adhd medications is done based on effect and response, I'm assuming that you're taking either amphetamines or methylphenidate, and even if you're taking others, almost surely the dosage is changed based on effect and side effects, that's why people will go from concerta 36 to 54 if they don't perform well enough or the opposite if 54 is making them feel bad... If they tell you it's to know if your kidneys are filtering the drug properly, that's bs too unless you have a diagnosis of renal insufficiency in which case, its still useless XD
And if iy was for any of thesw reasons... Why every month? Doing it once would be enough even when it's useless...

"3485","So far I've been managing this by making sure I eat a solid breakfast every morning. I've read that some people will add on a protein shake or meal replacement shake to their usual breakfast to increase their calorie/protein load right off the bat.

I gave up on trying to force myself to eat lunch pretty quickly. Instead, I focused on finding an all-day snack that I could (relatively) absentmindedly chomp on throughout the day. Eating a little bit here and there is a much less daunting task than trying to force myself through a full meal. I found that roasted chickpeas are a good way to trick my brain since eating them is mostly a fun tactile experience (since they've got a bit of crunch, but aren't as hearty as, say, almonds or other nuts). They're super cheap, and since I roast them myself I can spice them different ways to keep things interesting. If I forget them or run out, sometimes I'll have dried fruit, sunflower seeds, or popcorn instead. As long as it's easy to keep right at my desk all day and not total junk food, it's fair game.

By the time I get home and make dinner, my meds have usually worn off enough that eating dinner isn't an issue, though I'm pretty sure my portions are smaller than before going on a stimulant.","ef7492f",1,1548704247,"2019-01-28 19:37:27"

"3498","Recently I realized I was constantly living in the tomorrow and was missing the today. Stopped thinking about what imma do to make life one year from now nice and fun and decided to think about how to make my life TODAY better. I'm starting to do my failed classes over this summer and I'm 6 hours into the 4th simple question of my history homework :).

Normally that would make me feel like a failure and a piece of shit for not being able to do my work normally even though I took my medication today that is running out .  

(Only have 5 pills left and cant get any more because my old doc retired and I dont have insurance anymore and one bottle can cost $275+ but I cut them in half cause that half dose works better and it lasts longer. ) 

I realized that all that self hate isn't doing anything good and I tried not worrying about bullshit and tried to let myself be happy. At first when I found myself in a good mood at work I tried to come up with a reason for it. ""You're probably bi-polar man you're not supposed to be this happy something is wrong its gotta be your adhd. This happiness is just a mood swing you'll feel normal again."" 

I realized that I had been miserable for so long that being horribly depressed and fucked up was my ""normal"" and was only pulling myself back down with that type of thought. I was trying to sabotage myself without even realizing it. 

It's okay to be happy. It's okay to just let yourself not worry. Yeah happy times come and go I'm sure something will happen sometime down the road and I'll be unhappy for a different reason but right now I'm happy and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Life is good and I could be in a much much worse position than i am right now. I'm only 18 i gotta enjoy life because i could not live to see tomorrow. 

I've been in a generally good mood for the past 3 days and so far nothing bad has happened. I didnt break mentally I just stopped being miserable.

When you've lost yet another thing and cannot find it no matter how hard you try, when it should totally be there. Another pair of gloves gone, another hat gone, etc.

Hyperactivity is an issue when sitting still in class feels torturous and people around you keep getting annoyed because you have to stand up and go walk around or your leg bounces like a rabbit hyped up on cocaine for 2 hours.

Inattention becomes a problem when you've stopped paying attention and are day dreaming. Again. It's the fourth time. Class has been going for 10 minutes.

"3560","i was always a pretty good student and well behaved but i never paid attention in class, i was always daydreaming. i mean NEVER. unless it was (some) science classes and math (my two fav subjects). somehow i did pretty damn well for doing the bare minimum (especially in high school)... but i had structure and i think that's why i didn't notice anything was off. 

college rolls around and suddenly i had the freedom of not HAVING to go to class or having anyone after me to make sure i studied and kept my grades up. slowly but surely i did pretty fucking terrible semester after semester. i did well in the easy classes and the ones that interested me but anything else was fucking miserable and I'd either just barely get a C or fail the class. MIND YOU I WAS PRE-MED SO THIS WAS TERRIBLE. 

i changed my major from bio to psych (still wanted to go to med school but i liked studying psychology more so i didn't mind that id have to finish my bachelors and also finish my pre-reqs for med school). i started taking mostly online classes because i realized that GOING to class was a huge issue with me. i wasn't failing any more classes but i was still getting lots of c's. my second to last semester (fall 2014) things were SO bad that i was forgetting due dates, confusing due dates, and just in general things were just going south quick. 

i was also working full time in an office/accounting job and i was having trouble getting anything done there as well. and at home.. oh god. my room was always a mess even though clutter literally gives me anxiety. 

at this point i really wanted to try Adderall (yes i know it's illegal).. i couldn't find any anywhere so i decide to look up the symptoms for ADHD.. for...""research purposes""...... and that's when everything changed. going down the list i realized i had every single symptom of inattentive and some of hyperactivity and suddenly my whole life made sense.

i didn't have insurance but i KNEW i needed to get this taken care of so i paid the $375 to see the psychiatrist (sure enough got diagnosed) and then paid the $300 for a 30 day supply of Adderall every month until i got insurance.

it changed my life and that same semester i made the Dean's list for the first time ever. i wish i would've known this sooner because now i have pretty damn near irreparable damage to my GPA... i haven't gotten anything lower than a B since then so my hopes of getting into med school aren't TOTALLY dead. 

it's just a bit sad to think that i could've done so much more because I'd consider myself a pretty intelligent person but i just always did the bare minimum. 

since then things are much better. i still have bad days but theyre not as bad as before. my life has 100% changed for the better. ","dux6v9n",3,1519760781,"2018-02-27 19:46:21"

It can be quite engaging and I love feeling like what I do has a positive impact (as much as possible, I really try to advocate for people). But I'm not happy. There is the illusion of variety, but in truth it's quite monotonous; reading medical records is tedious at times and sooooooo repetitive. I'm in a cube for 8-10 hours a day and write the same analysis so many times I have a copy/paste template for many things. There are constant interruptions so when I finally do get focused down on something, the phone rings, or someone stops by. It's infuriating.

A diagnosis can be a blessing in the sense that it validates how you‚Äôve felt for so long and gives you an explanation for why things didn‚Äôt work the way they should have. It tells you where your problem lies (ie you have an issue focusing, but you are not lazy, or careless, or aren‚Äôt trying hard enough)

But it is NOT an excuse to stop trying to be better. All it does is give you a shortcut to years and years of peoples experience with the condition to find a faster path towards methods that work for you.

In a way, I feel like most people who have adhd to a degree that it impairs their daily life, won‚Äôt be the ones blaming every failure on adhd and expecting things to be given to them. For the very simple reason that when it impairs you enough, you *want* to change it and be better. If you can still function enough with just minor inconveniences, it‚Äôs easy to blame it all on the adhd.

"3579","I notice that sometimes, I'll have hyperbolically negative thoughts when I am angry, about the futile nature of existence (When I am not making up superhero justice fantasies). I then notice that these thoughts are hyperbolically distorted, but I'll continue in them because that's the momentum going on, and also because it gives me more energy than being sad, and 5% of the time that energy may actually be put to use in physical exercise, as opposed to 0% of the time for sadness.

I've read and heard about Buddhism's ""existence is suffering"" idea, and it sorta fits with the occasional ""happiness"" I feel, which often seems to be mentally sedative in nature.

When I exercise, I get endorphins, right? Endorphin, short for ""endogenous morphine"" aka opiates generated by the body, to sedate me. 

When I masturbate, I'll get dopamine, and perhaps also those endorphins, and I'll have a huge cloud over my head which will keep me going for hours and has made me late moreso than any other thing, like video games, for instance. I am obviously more happy to masturbate if it has been several days since the last time, and I was horny to begin with. Most of the time, I'll push myself into masturbating when I wasn't physically aroused to begin with, and the orgasm is then less satisfying. For a few weeks this year, I would masturbate (but not ejaculate) right before going to sleep in order to use the endorphins to sedate me into sleep.

I find that I get the happiest when I get some relatively simple but meaningful tasks done in one day. It doesn't make me happy to do any piece of work (or even finish it) that lasts longer than an hour. 

Food containing starches, natural animal fat (Pigs and Cows and Lambs, oh my), and vegetable oils (stir fry) makes me happy, but super fatty and super sugary foods (I absolutely detest frosting and this can put a damper on cake events) absolutely repulse me, so that helps me keep lean in addition to my already quick metabolism and lean body type.

In either case, how bioavailable the medication is depends on the pH in your gut. The less acidic your gut is, the more medication can be absorbed. So, stay away from things that would make your gut less acidic, like antacids. There are some foods/drinks that can also do this, most notably would be dairy. You may want to stay away from that as well until you're more comfortable with the medication.

"3624","I'm someone who's never been nervous about meds, but I figured i'd run my mouth for the sake of advice. Been on several different ones throughout the years, most for anxiety - started with zoloft when I was about 11 and didn't even know what I was taking it for, so it wasn't scary, and there's also been celexa, buspirone, welbutrin, xanax, and lamictal. Finally realized I might have ADHD after 15 years of this (at age 26), talked to a doctor, and immediately got put on adderall - got my official ADHD diagnosis a couple months later. I wasn't afraid to start adderall, but that was mostly because i'd already been through so many ups and downs with anxiety meds, I was used to what might happen.

Anyways, after trying so many, the way I see it is this: there's nothing you can't come back from if it doesn't work\*. I've had bad experiences on those anxiety meds, ranging from worsening mental symptoms (celexa took the cake for making my anxiety way worse; I went absolutely batshit on welbutrin) to frightening physical symptoms (buspirone made me dizzy every time I looked in a different direction! zoloft gave me worrisome heart palpitations every time I ate! full-body hives from welbutrin! clearly welbutrin uh wasn't a winner!) to just having nothing really help in any significant way. You can have scary, disheartening experiences - but ultimately, you're in control, and all you have to do is stop taking it. The worst it can give you is some rough days, so long as you keep in mind that whatever you might be experiencing, might just be the meds, and you wait it out based on that.

(Unless you get full-body hives. ...in which case, go see a doctor.)

I've had some unpleasant experiences on adderall, too. Mild headaches and dry-mouth, which weren't that bad. My appetite disappeared so hard when my dose got upped that convincing myself to eat was VERY difficult - and THAT was scary, but I had friends watching out for me and making sure I took care of myself, which helped a lot, and eventually my appetite came back. For a while my dose was too high, and I was getting overstimulated, which felt like a bit much, skin picking got really bad, had some insomnia, but all I had to do to fix that was call my doctor and get my dose lowered again. Honestly, the worst things are the days where it's not as effective, or the crashes (my dose is too low right now so I tend to crash after just a couple hours) - which kinda just takes you back to how you were off meds. It feels awful in comparison, but, I mean, it's nothing i'm not used to at this point - and with you going 21 years without meds, i'm sure you'd be used to it, too.

Even dealing with the side effects, adderall has improved my life so significantly that i'd absolutely be willing to deal with them (except for the dose-too-low crashes, cause then I might as well not be on it anyways) for the rest of my life if it meant seeing this kind of improvement. And the good news is, most of these side effects only lasted a couple weeks at most before evening out. 

Basically, it'll be okay! If things seem worrisome in the beginning, give it a couple weeks to see if bad side-effects mellow out, and trust your own self-perception if it's something *really* scary and you feel like you need to stop taking it right now. (For instance - on celexa, after just a couple weeks, I was so tense and anxious I could barely think or function. There is no waiting that one out - I stopped taking it quickly.) Also, I know that some folks are very scared of taking stimulants because, well, they're stimulants - worth keeping in mind that there's non-stimulant ADHD medications, and the chances that you'll become Basically A Meth Addict at therapeutic doses are pretty low tbh.

Somethin'll work. Be willing to try different meds if the first one doesn't work, or different doses, or what have you. If you can't afford to have your life disrupted by potential side-effects, it might be worth testing it out when you have at least 24 hours of time off to see what happens. Good luck!

"3645","I feel your pain. I lost my job due to ADHD-related struggles (before I was diagnosed) a few years ago. 

I also struggle with the feeling like I‚Äôm constantly sabotaging my own progress. I see a therapist, I try to take my meds, I try to set goals, but I still feel like I‚Äôm the single biggest thing keeping myself down. 

Two things I learned in therapy that might help: One, acknowledge that you have ADHD and that ADHD is considered a legitimate disability. Our brains literally do not process information the same way as others, and it makes a lot of things very hard for us. 

I know it seems obvious to acknowledge your ADHD on an ADHD sub, but I \*constantly\* have to remind myself that I need to stop holding myself up to the standards of people who don‚Äôt share my struggles! 

Second, externalize that shame. When you‚Äôre already feeling down about failing to meet your goals, it‚Äôs so unhelpful to beat yourself up. We have ADHD which means that we have a stronger tendency than most to equate our actions with our selves (especially if you‚Äôre a late-diagnosis like me, and have been told all your life that this is true). 

I one day complained to my therapist about my critical inner voice, saying that it felt like a little goblin was following me around, telling me how much I suck and how I‚Äôm going to fail because I always fail. She jumped on this, telling me to picture the goblin in more detail and try to speak to it. It sounds a little silly, but now I just picture that goblin as my inner critic (he looks a bit like a Jim Henson puppet). Don‚Äôt ignore the goblin, or be cruel to it, but speak to it, and try to understand why it‚Äôs doing what it‚Äôs doing.

For me, when I spoke to my goblin, I learned that it was actually just very scared. When I tried to set new goals and take new risks, the goblin was only thinking of how much it hurt to fail. I told the goblin that I understood its fear, but that it wasn‚Äôt being helpful, and asked it to chill out and leave me alone for a little bit.

By having my critical voice be a ‚Äòthing‚Äô I can imagine and speak to, it makes it harder for me to think things like ‚ÄúGod, of course I fucked up again, I‚Äôm useless, I‚Äôm going to die alone.‚Äù Now it‚Äôs more like, ‚ÄúGoblin, I know last time I didn‚Äôt do so well, but I‚Äôm still a good person, and I don‚Äôt deserve to be treated like that,‚Äù.

"3658","Here is my story, 

I wan't diagnosed until after my son was.  Going through the learning process about his ADHD shined a light on my childhood and my struggles throughout my life. Getting through 36 years of life without proper treatment was rough.  My wife also has ADD, so it was almost a sure thing we both passed it on to him.  My wife had been on medication for her ADD since before we started dating, so it helped she knew all about that stuff, and now that I am properly medicated I function so much better both at work and at home.  We both agreed that we want our son to succeed, but we don't want to medicate him to the point that he is a zombie that loses his personality.  Fortunately there is a much better understanding of ADHD today than there was when I grew up, and there are many more medications that can treat ADHD.   I was clueless as to how exactly the brain chemistry differed in someone with ADHD than someone without.  Three years later I still continue to educate myself, but I feel like I am much better and helping my son manage his ADHD and my own.  

As other posters have said, seek out a psychologist who specializes in children and ADHD.  Depending on your insurance situation, this can be very costly.  The initial assessment for my son was over $1K because we had not met his deductible yet, so it can be expensive depending on your insurance situation.  We also had to book the assessment around 4 months in advance.  Talk with the doctor or doctor's you see with your kid, and express your concerns over medications.   If you see a change you don't like in your kid, you can always stop giving them the medication and call the doctor's office asking to try something else.   

It also sounds like you may need to see a psychologist yourself to see if you truly have ADD and could get treatment for it.  It took about a year after my son's diagnosis for me to finally admit I need to see a specialist (que wife slap across the back of the head accompanied with ""duh"") and another year to find a medication and dosage that worked well for me.","f5pt2v3",1,1572367153,"2019-10-29 16:39:13"

But because I was not diagnosed with ADHD at the time I didn't know where it was all coming from. Then I got diagnosed two years ago and started seeing an ADHD therapist. Same thing as what you are experiencing. But who could I talk to about the nitty gritty. The work that drives me insane and how I might be going about it wrong??? No one. It was so frustrating that I could not share with anyone the daily mess-ups and struggles at work particularly. 

So I signed up to watch these web webinars at the 2019 ADHD awareness expo. https://www.adhdexpo.com/

There were videos on specific topics that interested me that were done by coaches and psychiatrists. These saintly ppl even give out their contact info during their talks. It was like a wealth of knowledge and support so I emailed one coach I liked and the rest is history. I was clueless on how to go about finding a coach. And we do Skype sessions weekly or biweekly.

It is expensive but I figured the longer I stalled, the more pain I'd be in and it was an investment in myself for my future. So i definitely recommend it.

Edit: I thought last night that the relationship was over; they put me in a risky situation without regard for my safety or the fact that I have a young child dependent on me, which I didn't think I could forgive.

You saying they were burned out makes complete sense, but I think they don't realize they have that limitation? They planned the amount of time we would spend together, including spending the night/seeing a movie the next day.

I think my needs are pretty high right now, for sure... I did have some expectations that since they reached out to me, they would also make an effort to work towards repairing the relationship? This may be a VERY high expectation of someone who probably doesn't even fully understand what they're dealing with yet? 

Can you give me some insight into how I should have handled the situation? What I'm struggling with now is on one hand, maybe I should have suppressed my emotional response, but on the other hand, I'm allowed to have feelings maybe?

I did say twice during the evening (once before we went to the event and again after we returned to their home) that I felt upset, I understood they were not trying to upset me, and we didn't have to talk about it right then.

Should I have left before the event? Requested we stay home? I felt like either thing would have been seen as reactive and upset them more. I feel like I'm always on eggshells...","dl8j5wk",2,1502019432,"2017-08-06 11:37:12"

Look, do some research.  There's a fair bit out there that involves various types of brain scans.  There's one that shows how MPH affects the ADHD brain as opposed to a non-ADHD brain.
If you head over to www.addforums.com and ask for some of this information, I'm sure some of their research geeks will provide you with some good studies.
The fact is, this disorder is extremely well documented.  

Buddy's a glorified security guard, ask him what qualifies him as an authority.  Has even taken an abnormal psych class?  
Has he even read the DSM entry for ADHD? If he hasn't even done that, tell him he can't possibly know WTF he's talking about and to have some respect or STFU.

As for your mom, find Ari Tuckman's podcast and have her listen to a few episodes.  Specifically, **ADHD Is Real‚ÄìBut How Real?**  But there are a few others you might want her to listen to as well.
You can find it here:
http://adultadhdbook.com/page/4/
You can also get most of it from iTunes, I believe. There, it's titled ""*More Attention, Less Deficit*"" or you can search ""ADHD"".
I used PodCruncher, which I think can get certain podcast entries for some podcasts than iTunes shows as available.



Unfortunately there will be people who will refuse to believe.

Crap, I thought my ADHD was borderline and manageable (I read the DSM entry in an abnormal psych class and thought ""holy shit! that's me!"").  When I got diagnosed and received treatment, my quality of life changed so drastically that there can be no doubt for me, or anyone who really knows me that this is real.

"3687","That's an interesting point, and while true to an extent, not all illegal drugs are classified as narcotics, and adderall (an amphetamine) is not one of those that are. Strictly controlled drugs like heroin and cocaine are are treated as narcotics, but amphetamines don't actually make the cut. This is just a quick wiki reference, but I found this in the entry on narcotics:

""Statutory classification of a drug as a narcotic often increases the penalties for violation of drug control statutes. For example, although federal law classifies both cocaine and amphetamines as ""Schedule II"" drugs, the penalty for possession of cocaine is greater than the penalty for possession of amphetamines because cocaine, unlike amphetamines, is classified as a narcotic.""

If you dont want to mess around with tone and rhythm, you can use a more direct approach to communicate the same thing.

Perhaps this: ""Hmmm...Im not sure what my favorite would be but I really like___________"" 

Try to put emphasis/excitement into the ""really like"" part to emphasize the positive part of the statement. It communicates that you enjoy their question (otherwise they might pay more attentioncto the ""I dont know"" part and end up thinking their question bores you)

Can't change the past, but I can control my future!

EDIT: And something that I think made up my mind to get the diagnosis in the first place, was that I cared so much I fainted before an exam, but I also didn't 'care enough' to study diligently for exams or pay attention in class.

"3720","Hi, welcome to /r/ADHD

1. Try developing a structured routine. There are lots of self help guides available and it can be really important for people with ADHD

2. I've been unmedicated since my teens. The ""semi-productive zombie"" analogy is definitely something I recognise. Have you ever tried coping with the condition without medication?

3. Not sure, can't say I can relate to that, maybe try making notes?

4. Once again, try to work to a routine.

5. Yes absolutely, it's a fundamental symptom of ADHD. It's called Hyper Focus. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocus

6. I remember being told that back when I was medicated, but it's also true that if you take them regularly for a long period of time you can build up a resistance. I suppose this is really a question for your doctor.

Edit - If you'd like to learn more about Hyper Focus, the Hunter vs Farmer hypothesis is a really interesting theory that tries to explain some aspects of ADHD such as hyper focus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_vs._farmer_hypothesis","czhuokm",1,1454184663,"2016-01-30 20:11:03"
"3721","Can I ask how high your adderall dose is, and if you tried going any higher or tried any other meds (like ritalin, or Vyvanse, or anything else) before you settled on your current dose of adderall?  If you can only semi-focus and your executive function isn't great still (the ability that governs a lot of impulse control, being able to pick the right things to focus on, following through on plans, etc), then you might either be on too low a dose or on the wrong medication.  Adderall works for a lot of people, but not for everyone, and the dose always has to be determined on a person-by-person basis; there's no ""optimal dose for everyone.""

In the meantime, though, have you worked with a therapist to try building better skills for learning and growing?  CBT from a competent therapist can be helpful for retraining your brain into better patterns, as well as having someone to help hold you accountable to your goals.

I don't really know how to just force myself to do a lot of things I should do, especially without my meds, but sometimes if you just keep trying at a particular thing, even just a few hours a week if that's all you can manage, you eventually reach a point where you start getting better at it, and start being able to do more.  You just have to get through the point where instead of getting better, it feels like a terrible exhausting thing that you want to stop doing.

Maybe you can ask your husband to help you set up some goals and keep you accountable?  I find that's also really helpful.  Having someone close who you can't just ignore to bug you (within limits you agree on together) about doing that thing you said you were going to do.  It'll be tough, and you'll have to remind yourself when he's bugging you and you feel like, ""Why can't he just realize I can't actually do this thing?"" that he's bugging you because you \*can\* do it, and you agreed that this was what you needed, and hell even if you can't finish the whole task you wanted to finish, you can at least start it.

ADHD can be a tough beast that requires exactly what we're bad at: will power.  But people who can help keep you accountable to your goals can be invaluable, even on the days when you wish they would just disappear.  On days when you've managed to push through something difficult and come out knowing that you've accomplished something, it's worth it.","e9x63t5",31,1542497930,"2018-11-17 23:38:50"

- tomorrow, call a friend- video call is even better! And study together. Pretend you're in a library and mute the call if that helps just to have company. Or keep the call active so you 'must not disturb' them and it helps keep you focused. Or actually study together and work through problems.

- set timers for your work. Nevermind pomodoro, I've found 15 mins better for me. 15 working, 5-10 break, repeat. 

- exercise. It really does help. If you're allowed to go run outside, do it! 

- set yourself a rough routine. I find time is not the important thing, but tasks are. Have time ranges to do things, like wake up between 6&amp;8, start work before 9 etc. Try to establish a routine every day, like wake up, play on phone for half an hour or so, get up, bathroom stuff (toilet, brush teeth, wash face), back to bedroom, get dressed, sit at desk etc.

- I find sitting at my desk is the first difficult choice I have to do. So to make it easier, I don't make myself start work straight away, I get to the desk earlier and browse Reddit for half an hour. Then when I'm bored of that, my brain goes ""oh yeah I'm at my desk. Guess I could study for a bit"" and I'll pop my phone down after locking it for 15 mins using forest, and I'll just chill and do a little bit. Then when I'm bored, check phone- ""yay I did 17 mins and 32 secs, I get a break!"" Cue Reddit. Repeat. It's not an amazing amount of hours by using this method, but it's better than 0.","flch12c",1,1585030547,"2020-03-24 06:15:47"

I almost never had problems in primary school. The rare behavioral ones were quickly dismissed, because schools have bigger fish to fry, my lessons were really well lead, I sat in the second row, I think I compensated a lot. I once sat in the back of the class and could barely listen, but that was one day. I was labelled a gifted, non-problem kid. Then from junior high it went downhill - my coping skills weren't enough anymore, I believe.

Read a lot on how ADHD manifests itself, mainly in girls. I once came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/search?q=fired&amp;restrict_sr=on):
&gt; Girls ‚Äúare more likely to be daydreaming, staring out the window, twisting their hair,‚Äù Matlen said.

"3760","There is certain criteria to determine if you have adhd. The symptoms are present throughout childhood and adulthood. Here is a list of symptoms:

 Behavioral:¬†aggression, excitability, fidgeting, hyperactivity, impulsivity, irritability, lack of restraint, or persistent repetition of words or actions

Cognitive:¬†absent-mindedness, difficulty focusing, forgetfulness, problem paying attention, or short attention span

Mood:¬†anger, anxiety, boredom, excitement, or mood swings

Also common:¬†depression or learning disability

Is it genetic? Yes 

Isn't it bad to have it? Depending on the severity of the symptoms and how bad it affects your daily life it can bad. There are treatments like CBT and medication but it all affects each individual differently. 

Is it rare? Well 7.2 % of the world population has it. But we are not certain, many individuals don't know what adhd is or even are able to obtain a diagnosis. I am guessing that of we had the resources to see and test everyone, it would be a bit more common. 

How to tell if you have it? Well if you feel the symptoms fit then you may need to see a psychiatrist for an evaluation and diagnosis. Although these symptoms are not inclusive for adhd, other disorders can be cause similar problems.

D) You have to feed the dopamine. Exercise, lovely things, music, playtime. Think about playing, not hobbies with 'value'. Children get to play, with no judgement, no need to be productive. So mess around! 
E) RSD is your enemy and it's lying to you. Be around people more and you get better at it. But also it's OK not to enjoy loud stuff and big crowds. Just say yes to invitations. Small talk is easy if you stop,second guessing yourself and just let the train of thought ramble on, and ask occasional questions.

"3762","That's cool. In the US though, stimulant meds are CIIs, and they can't be written with refills. Pretty much anything else (even less strictly controlled drugs) can. 

With most other medications,  refills are ok if the doctor writes a prescription for them (Ie, 30 days supply with 4 refills, etc.). But there are two possible roadblocks: 1. If it's too soon since the last fill, the insurance (here in the US) won't pay for the meds. They'll reject the claim with a 'refill too soon' error. You can obviously get around this by paying cash, but if the med is expensive,  that might not be feasible. 2. If it's a controlled substance, or addictive or the pharmacist feels at all uneasy about it, they can refuse to fill it. Even if you volunteer to pay for it. Sometimes, ESPECIALLY if you volunteer to pay for it.

"3764","One thing you need to remember is as a legal adult you alone are responsible for your mental health and as an adult, even on your parents insurance, you have all the HIPPA protections of an adult.  

1.  Talk to your doctor and explain your mom took your perscription and is refusing to fill it.  See if he will write another one for you.  I am on Concerta and have to physically pick up the script to fill it so you might have to go back and get the script from him.  

2.  When you go to fill it do not worry about them knowing or not knowing.  Since its a script for an adult dependent they cannot control anything the pharmacy, insurance, or doctor does.  They can not refuse the script to be paid for by insurance, they cannot have the pharmacy withhold the meds from you.  They also CANNOT remove you from their insurance simply because you filled a script they dont approve of... Per the ACA it can be very difficult to remove an adult dependent from the plan, ESPECIALLY when its not open enrollment.  

3.  The only thing that you would have to worry about is paying for the co-pay or deductible if applicable.  So if you rely on your parents to actually pay for it then this could be a problem.  That said, if you have the cash to pay for the co-pay then you are golden and your parents cant do a thing about it.  

I learned this while working for one of the major, nationwide, health insurance companies.  You are 100% protected as an adult and your parents cannot interfere with your treatment at all.

One of the things that talk against giving you this (counter indicator for treatment or precautions) is depression and especially suicidal thoughts (I had both, pretty severely, they knew because I had been committed for 3 months previously). 

As for drug seeking behavior, I smartly lied about alcohol when asked to avoid any issues in this regard. Not an alcoholic by any means but I'd sometimes self medicate a bit much to try and let go of shit or calm down. 

Luckily they decided to give it to me anyway despite my medical history. Aside from the ADHD-PI, my depression is all but gone, I can feel sad like anyone else but I haven't cried at all since I started Ritalin 2 weeks ago, whereas before, once or twice a week I was sobbing like a small child who's dropped his ice cream.

Because of said counter indicators to doctors, I would advice you to not tell them if you're depressed or have suicidal ideation or similar. 
If you have an overly fussy/nervous psychiatrist, you may not get the meds that you need.
Ritalin might help you mood wise like me. It increases dopamine (same is released when in love etc, hence why cocaine is so addictive) so it definitely won't make you feel worse.
My symptoms when not medicated are similar to yours btw.","fizrjro",1,1582871880,"2020-02-28 06:38:00"

"3797","Hopefully you get to read this before your appointment:  
Adderall is a mix of 4 different amphetamine salts (comprising of roughly 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine).  The XR version is simply an extended delivery mechanism of these chemicals.  d-amp is primary a central nervous system stimulant (mind), while l-amp is mostly peripheral (body).

If you are ADHD:PI, you don't really need the peripheral stimulation (l-amp).  Dexedrine is solely d-amp and has been around a long time (read: cheap!).  I much prefer Dexedrine over Adderall since I found the peripheral effects to be strong and unnecessary (extreme stimulant crash).

Some bozo in the marketing division of Shire decided to take Dexedrine and add on an amino acid (l-lysine) to it and reformulate the ER delivery mechanism into Vyvanse.  There are a few benefits (or costs?) to Vyvanse including a reduced abuse potential (the d-amp will only become active after passing through the digestive system) and a 10-12 hour duration compared to 8 with Dexedrine ER.  Too bad it costs 20x the same dosage of Dexedrine! (with my insurance at least)

In the end, it's all up to your body's chemistry.  Dexedrine has been the best choice for me so far, but each person reacts differently to medication.  Maybe your doctor will start you on a methylphenidate based stimulant? (ritalin etc.)

I still have motivation issues beyond belief, but that's more than likely due to depression, which is being currently sorted out.

If I've misjudged/misread, I apologise. To address your other points, undiagnosed ADHD can very frequently cause depression, or be masked by depression, or come together with depression (comorbidity). If your Dr has the (factually incorrect) view that ADHD isn't real, and you think it explains your issues and they aren't just depression, it's totally ok to seek out a second opinion, preferrably from a specialist or someone experienced  and up to date with adult ADHD.

ADHD as a disorder has been around longer than pharmaceutical companies. ADHD responds very well to medication in most people, and it's impossible to replicate the effects medication gives with diet, exercise, all the other myths out there. It's the preferred treatment method because *it works* and it's immediate.

Do companies make money on it? Sure, it's a capitalist economy after all. Are they pushing it? Maybe, there's some evidence little white boys are overdiagnosed (but literally every other sector is UNDERdiagnosed), don't they push basically all drugs though (looking at you erectile dysfunction commercials). Is it ALL just some elaborate scam that we are just stupid enough to have bought into? Of course not. 

I don't take powerful drugs and deal with the side effects and risks because I've been swayed by advertising - I take them because they make a noticeable and beneficial impact on my ""doing stuff"" abilities, and I struggled to get a diagnosis and medication, so it's not like Drs are handing it out like candy. I weigh the pros and cons, benefits vs side effect, risk vs reward of long term damage. You know what else has big risks? Unmanaged ADHD.

There are people that have been on the same med and dose for forever. So no, not everyone turns into some emotionless Ritalin zombie. Can that happen when someone isnt on the right medication and dose? Yes, which is why it's important to work with a Dr that takes ADHD seriously and understands stuff like that so you can try something else.","eym18f8",1,1567196961,"2019-08-30 20:29:21"

I've changed jobs quite a lot due to discrimination at work, but he's a bit older than me and is in the ""a job is for life, warts and all"" crowd.

"3861","Yes. Right now I‚Äôm in a really similar place, except i‚Äôm in my late 20s and I‚Äôve also sought help because I have ADHD. 

My primary care doctor is also quite sure of this and referred me to a psych. I‚Äôm having a hard time being diagnosed because the psych thinks I‚Äôm an addict, although my addiction issues were 10+ years ago. Teenage stuff. She‚Äôs pressed over a lifestyle I‚Äôve long walked away from.

Untreated ADHD and the co-morbidities that usually follow led to my addiction problems (mainly feeling like a failure), not fucking Adderall. I was actually getting my life together on ADHD meds, not abusing them. 

This psych has been nothing but a pain in the ass and is intentionally giving me the runaround. She had me bring in all of my school records, telling me she needed them before we could proceed, then telling me ‚Äòthis wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for‚Äô. She even pretended to write a referral for me. I felt like an ass calling the doctor she ‚Äòreferred‚Äô me to after he told me ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have a referral for you. Your doctor needs to do the actual work‚Äô, as in, fax the forms. I‚Äôve been compliant with her requests and firm and insistent about what‚Äôs going on and she‚Äôs been doing nothing for the past four months but wants me to jump through more hoops. 

I do think it‚Äôs frustrating and demeaning. And downright silly. And a tremendous waste of time. I feel offended by this too. 

It‚Äôs okay to give children, who barely have any understanding over their brain and chemistry Big Pharma-friendly stimulants but grown ass people don‚Äôt have that choice? TF? Grown ass people coming in with a litany of complaints and a burden of proof aren‚Äôt being taken seriously? This makes my blood boil. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre experiencing this. To me it feels like gaslighting. 

People‚Äôs lives are at stake and little ten-year-old Steven will get meds before either of us. It‚Äôs the sad truth. 

The only advice I have is to keep pushing for a diagnosis and meds. Try to be firm and consistent and make sure to reiterate how your symptoms are negatively impacting your life. Fight for testing. I don‚Äôt know why sending someone to get tested is such a hassle. They can find out if someone is lying or not THROUGH TESTING. I don‚Äôt know why they just won‚Äôt do it, Jesus. These doctors act like it‚Äôs taking time out of their day to write a damn referral and get a definite answer from someone who isn‚Äôt them because they are the end-all-be-all and know everything, even about people they do not personally know. 

The nonsense they put us undiagnosed adults through. 

I‚Äôm pursuing every available channel to get a diagnosis/meds even if that means I have to procure them through less than conventional means. These gatekeepers aren‚Äôt going to stop me from getting my life to where I feel it could be. I know meds work for me. It‚Äôs part of how I know I have ADHD‚Äînot a ‚Äòmaybe‚Äô, not a ‚Äòyou need to change your diet‚Äô thing, not a ‚Äòyou need to have better time management‚Äô thing. 

Don‚Äôt let them stop you, either. Switch doctors. Call up your insurance and see what you can do regarding finding another doctor. Hell, switch your insurance if you have the means/ability to. I‚Äôm in NY and have medicaid and have done almost all of these already.

I think you need some more sympathetic friends, possibly in addition to, but possibly instead of, your existing ones. Atypical neural architecture isn't something you can will away or tough your way through. You have a genuine medical difference, and some things most people find easy are difficult for you. Which was the best thing about getting a diagnosis for me - despite all the taunts I'd received over the years and all the negative self-talk I'd internalised, I'm *not* just lazy or low on character. I try not to use this as an excuse for failure, though, but rather as an excuse to *use ridiculous-seeming coping mechanisms*. You think it's funny how I add all future events to an online calendar, hit the gym every lunchtime or use the Pomodoro technique? Tough. I have a medical condition which means I have to do those things to be effective.

As for the meds: IANAMD, but it sounds like you may need to increase your dose further - talk to your doctor. That said, I found the effects of Concerta (same active ingredient as Ritalin, but slower-release) to be quite subtle until I came off it for a while and realised how much worse my symptoms were without it!

But anxiety and depression, like you mentioned, can absolutely cause ADHD-like symptoms as a secondary effect. Even under-managed depression and anxiety will have this effect.

"3917","i work at an action sports retailer. locally owned. my two good friends run it as business partners. we sell bikes/boards/skis/outerwear/apparel... lots of stuff.

although uni is my first priority (almost halfway through law school right now), i am highly motivated and a good employee. i am committed wholeheartedly to making customers happy and making myself and my friends sweet, sweet buckaroos.

it jives with my ADHD pretty well. it is highly social (sales), technical (service/repair), organized (merchandizing/cleaning), sometimes unstructured (if there is 5 things to do i get to choose what to get done first-to-last), reliant on my experience (training newbies), fits with my interests/hobbies (mountain bike, hiking, and snowboard specifically)...

i've been there on/off for about 8 years so i know what needs to be done and how to get it done. customers always come first. we really want them to have a good time, get what they want/need, and then come back for more and/or bring more customers in with them. the city is not that big and we do have some competitors so someone's loyalty is valuable to us.

i have made some pretty good friends through client relationships. get paid fairly well (i'm the best paid non-salary retail employee i know of). the hours are relatively flexible around my studies. have even been offered lots of opportunities in sales and/or marketing (pharma sales, wholesale, advertising, branding, real estate).

when i come to work it feels like... home. it is home.

it's awesome! but... it is retail pay after all so i will have to move on to something more lucrative in the spring to help pay for tuition. something in the bush where i literally can't spend my money. firefighting, surveying, wildlife census, treeplanting... something like that.

"3923","This is definitely a theory I've read in some circles, especially feminist ones. I think it has some merit, BUT also that BPD is a real thing. 

I have at least one friend with a BPD diagnosis who views it as doctors being dismissive about their PTSD, and shares your views about hysteria. But whatever the best label, there is a recogniseable collection of symptoms which we call BPD.

It's also important to remember that modern BPD treatments were developed by Marsha Linehan, who had BPD as a teen before it was a real diagnosis, and developed DBT based on her own coping strategies. Which is so badass!

My general view on mental illnes and neuro stuff is, moving towards a symptom-based rather than a label-based approach. That is, getting together people with executive dysfunction (whatever their diagnosis), and helping them with practical skills. Because when you look at diagnoses they overlap a lot, and are sometimes contradictory. Depressed people can over OR under eat - so they need two different approaches to help with that.

So, for me at least, it doesn't matter whether someone objectively has BPD, or a person without BPD who has problems with self injury, relationships, dissociating, and extreme emotions etc etc. The same treatment is gonna work, because the symptoms are the same - you know?

Like, certainly I think there is a good exploration to do into links with ASD, or people being wrongly diagnosed with ASD/BPD depending on gender, as I do see a lot of overlap there.","d9r2cj9",1,1478614891,"2016-11-08 14:21:31"

My best tip to you is: when you get to the ""testing"" point take a family member with you who knows the ins and outs of what you struggle with. This helps the process massively.

* Yes print it out... on paper... and strike off with a pencil.  A piece of paper doesn't contain the entire internet of distractions like a phone/computer does.
* Make the list as detailed as possible, break down every separate action in every room into the smallest units possible.  My list has about 30 items, and it's just for a small apartment.
* As OP says, the initial tasks are just putting all the crap away... that's 1 task per room + the rest of the actual cleaning tasks per room.
* You can tweak you list a little bit each time to improve it... I reordered my soft-copy list many times to put things in the order that makes sense to do them in the future.  e.g. wiping benches before vacuuming.  Also if you have some battery-powered vacuum, don't do all the vacuuming at once (cause the battery will die). have other tasks you can do between charges.  
* Like everything else, vacuuming is a separate task for every room.
* Most rooms will have about 5 tasks each, even though some of them only take about one minute each.

Once you eliminate as much ""thinking"" as possible... it's actually much easier to just slam through the ""doing"" without getting distracted.  And striking lots of small things off one at a time gives a small dopamine hit, like games/online scrolling etc do.  If one of the tasks seems to hard right now, fine pick an easier one and come back to it.  Once you get going, it all feels much less overwhelming.

"3948","This reminds me of getting my (third) ADHD test. My first was when I was a kid, my second was for a ""permanent"" adult diagnosis, and the third was because I lost the paperwork and the doctor only kept it on his end for ten years. 

I was blown away. The test I got at 30 was the same test I got at seven. When the psychologist went through the ""uncertain"" results with me, he pointed to the language section as evidence of me potentially not having ADHD. I pointed out that I am a professional writer and also not seven. He just shrugged and said something like ""Yeah, we don't really take that into consideration."" 

There's a perception, even among medical professionals, that ADHD is just the most obvious symptoms. That if you can sit through a conversation without pacing, you must not have it. This leads to a fucked up dynamic that has really screwed me over in adulthood where I show up looking for help, and they say they want to try six-months+ of ""adaptive"" measures before they'll give me medication, while simultaneously citing the adaptive measures I already use as proof that I don't need medication. Meanwhile, the measures they insist on me trying are the same one's that have been pushing since I was seven. I've already incorporated the ones that work and tried the others.

"3986","&gt; now I just feel like I don't have time to do anything but assignments when I would like to be studying concepts in really broad contexts.

Again, this is a normal thing normal people feel.  
The main difference, though, is how you deal with it.  

I work at a university with lots of undergrads, I hear their conversations a lot and talk them from time to time. The common thing they all go through towards end of semester is not being able to do anything but study/assignments.  

Try not to compare yourself with other people, you have no idea what they are really doing behind the scenes, many people that seem like they have their shit together, quite often don't. It sets up unrealistic expectations of yourself.  

Instead, think back of what you did over the semester, you say you started off well. Can you figure out any reasons why you went off the rails? Do you have a solid schedule in place for the entire semester? If you do, did you follow through with it? If you don't, well there is a good place to start for next semester.  

Don't beat yourself up about things. Also, don't expect yourself to be able to sit through 8 hours of writing an assignment, that's crazy talk. Give yourself 4 hours MAX in a day for doing that boring ass self driven stuff. To push it further risks burning out and compounding your struggles for the following days/weeks.  

What you did yesterday has a big impact on today. That's another lesson we ADHDer's struggle with. We may not think/feel yesterday matters for today, but the reality is quite different and it does.

"3987","DO NOT TRY TO QUIT IT ALL AT ONCE.

Going from six cups to 0 will give you extreme headaches due to how extreme the withdrawal is.

You need to slowly detox yourself.  Lets make a goal of moving from six cups of coffee, to five, to four, to three, to two, to one.  And each reduction happens over a period of two weeks.  Thus in 3 months you are either off caffeine or you are down to a more manageable level of 1 or 2 a day.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Drink decaff or similar tasting caffeinated drinks will help.  Your goal is to remove the caffeine, and not the coffee or other liquid support.  Make it easier on your body so you do not feel like you are completely changing your life.

Carry a visual reminder of how many coffees/cans of soda you have drank per day.  At home and at work have poker chips at your desk.  Each time you drink a cup of coffee add a poker chip to your pocket so if you had 2 cups today you have 2 chips.  Each time you get up to drink a cup of coffee with caffeine you stick your hands in your pockets and count the number of poker chips.  This way you do not have to remember how much its been per day, instead you have a physical reminder, an external memory.

Visualize the poker chip in your mind and how the poker chip is the goal, we want less of these in your pocket.  Decide to yourself do you really want it, or do you really not.  It is your decision, you have a quota per day and your goal is not to surpass the quota.  It is okay to reach your quota (so 5 cups is fine for the first two weeks for example) but it is not okay to go over.


Once your body is weaned off the caffeine so you do not need it as much due to the gradual tapering off, then you will get less side effects but it will also be easier from a psychological perspective to quit.","cm2l7ms",3,1415993275,"2014-11-14 19:27:55"
"3988","You resent your parents, and I resent almost every teacher I had from 7th grade on. My poor parents tried really hard, but had no idea what to do with me. I went to the school psychologist for testing in elementary school, in jr. high, and again in HS, when I tried to drop out. They took me to a child psychologist because one school said there must be ""problems in the home"". I went to the dr almost every year for school issues, and was tested for vitamin deficiency, anemia, mono, Epstein\-Barr, thyroid problems, hormone imbalance, diabetes, narcolepsy, petit mal seizures, etc.  Everyone told us there was nothing wrong with me; I was just ""not challenged in the classroom"", ""immature"", ""undisciplined"", ""marching to my own drum"", had a ""contrary nature"". 

No amount or variety of punishment helped...I was always mildly disobedient, my belongings were always a mess, and I had to be reminded of things over and over. If a homework assignment was even attempted, it involved tears and everyone screaming at each other.  In high school, I asked my teachers for extra help with organization and accountability and was denied, because those are skills I ""should have mastered by now"", and ""you need an IEP for that"". 

I was just a victim of bad timing; when I was a kid, ADHD wasn't really on the radar for girls. And at 25, I was struggling in grad school and working in an ADHD clinic, and recognized that I fit all the criteria, but when I told the program director, he laughed at me and said adults don't have it. Last year I went through another round of medical tests, including an MRI and a PET scan before a neurologist suggested my problems might be attention\-related and to see a psychiatrist.

I had to learn and respect my personal limits and let go of the disappointment of others when I reached them. 

I had to judge what I could commit to by what I could maintain not by what I could do in spurts. 

I had to respect my own mental emotional energetic cycles and not pile things on when feeling good and on top of things. 

I had to remind myself that the first part of the semester is easy and the last part hard and that is okay.

"4040","Wow, you just blew my mind.  Like, this sub blows my mind every time I read something, seriously.  I never realized how much of my life experience is directly related to ADHD.

* I don't remember all that much about my life from when I was 5-9, but looking back, I had 0 real friends that I hung out with in elementary school.  No one stands out in my mind. I'm sure it's because I talked wayyyy too much and was much smarter than a lot of kids but in an obnoxious way. As in, I was the kid that had read all the non research type books in our school library and would give people recs if they asked + used ""big"" words a lot.  I was always talking to the more funny boys in class and remember getting in trouble because I was ""flirting"" too much, when I didn't even know what flirting was.  I just thought they were funny and I was more comfortable talking to boys than girls. 

* I remember being ""bored"" quite a bit, which in retrospect was acute depression, and because of it there was a time when I ditched school and hid out in this empty house by myself all day until I got in trouble for ditching school.

* In jr. high I had a few friends that I hung out with in my neighborhood and I remember always trying to befriend the new kids, of which we had a lot of all the time because we lived in an area with a lot of military towns.  I do remember being super weird and over dramatic and standoffish at times because of, in retrospect, depression, so I'm surprised they still stayed my friends with me.  I do remember someone telling me to stop using such ""big words"", because they didn't understand what I was talking about, at that time too lol. 

* In high school I had a few of the same good friends plus a few new ones. We hung out in a group and we're all creative and artsy so we were kind of ""other"". In my last year of high school we had a falling out and I mainly hung out with one friend. I did have a lot of acquaintances, mostly because I'd known many of them for years. 

* I had the best luck with friends in my 20s.  I had figured out how to pick up on more social cues (like not being an asshole or obnoxiously smart aka dumb myself down a bit) and how to stay out of my own head and pay more attention to others (if you know what I mean) so I made more friends.

* In my early 20s I moved away and continued to have a few main friends but hung out in large groups of either work friends after work or with friends of my good main friends.  I had a good friend that I'd known since high school that moved to my area and we ended up being roommates.  She had the knack of making lifelong friends of almost everyone she met, which I was very jealous of, since I could only really make a few good friends at a time. 

* In my late 20s that friend had moved away but I continued to make a few great friends at any jobs I had and hung out with them solely.  

* It was around this time that I started to notice that I would make friends in one situation or job and then promptly drop them when I moved on to another situation or job. It's like I don't have the knack of staying in touch with people, and don't really care to. 

* At this point in my life (early 40s) I have one good friend that I have managed to keep who feels more like a family member that is forced to stay a friend because they're like family. Otherwise I am a loner and have no problems with that.  I like my own company and I love to read.  I have a few work friends that I hang out with when I feel like having company and some extra good friends that I talk to daily online but who live all over the world. 

* I'm not sure if I'll ever change.  I feel as if I should make the effort to make more extra good friends in person but lack the drive or interest to do so.  


Edit:  God this is long.  Sorry about that. 

**Tl;dr-**  I collect acquaintances easily but have a hard time gaining and keeping good friends that like me for me and not because I suppressed parts of my personality.  I lack some knowledge of social cues, am very smart, opinionated, overly honest, and am a bit weird, so I have the most luck making friends with people just like me or who enjoy being around people like me lol.  You either love me or intensely dislike me.

"4043","I totally relate to your story. I did pretty well in high school with my extremely strict parents constantly on my ass... of course it was subject to how I felt about the content I was studying. 

It was in university when I started to really mess things up. I was put on academic probation in my second semester and it still brings my GPA down quite a bit 4 years later. 
It was a huge struggle for me to feel so intelligent in grade school just to get failing grades in university. I tried significantly harder the following years but my grades would still never reflect my capabilities with the nature of university classes (sit in lecture, do your readings, write exams.) 

I was finally diagnosed and prescribed Ritalin, and in addition to going into the Elementary/ Middle school Education program, which is very engaging and of interest to me, I flourished and preformed to the best of my ability. I also found that it has helped me immensely with the social and emotional issues I had - something I had previously blamed my character and personality for. 

I'm currently a student teacher for grades 6 &amp; 7, and I can safely say that having ADHD has helped me become a better teacher. I can relate to students who have low self- efficacy, I can help students who have trouble keeping themselves organized, I can coach students who need help with their social skills, and I have myself as a reference when I try to plan engaging lessons. 

You can definitely help change things for the better! Even being an Educational Assistant could change the lives and experiences of a lot of students. I love knowing that I can make a difference with something that's considered a disability, so I would highly recommend working in a school.

You mention one thing you don't want to do, and a few things you'd rather be doing.  Now, I have to ask - is it a motivational thing?  The way you described yourself is all I have to go on.  I'd be remiss in offering any advice if I didn't ask for clarification.  So, do you just not want to do &lt;whatever&gt; and you can think of a hundred other things you would like to get done?  Or, do you find yourself unable to do things, because there's a hundred other things you'd rather or need to get done?  

Major differences here:
-Not want to do anything at all - signs of depression.  
-Not want to do &amp;lt;whatever&gt; and your thoughts turn to something more palatable - signs of being a human being. 
-Not being able to get &amp;lt;whatever&gt; done because you feel a need to take care of &amp;lt;whatever else&gt; as well and end up doing only bits and pieces and never finishing - signs of ADD/ADHD.

I went through the whole diagnosis, misdiagnosis, new doctors, same old song and dance for literally decades (will be 48 in a few days).  Bipolar, manic depressive, schizophrenic, epileptic (yes - your mind can do some pretty weird things to ""survive"" as it were) and others. Anyway, after about 15 years they finally found a combination that seems to fit: ADHD coupled with depression and a touch of social anxiety for good measure. 

I'm happier now on a tailored combination of Adderall, Seroquel, and Cymbalta that actually works.

So, just take that all in: I represent a patient who shows symptoms of:
1) Epilepsy.
2) Depression.
3) Social Anxiety.

I'm on a very light dose of:
1) A low dosage of an SSNRI.
2) A very low dose of dextroamphetamine/amphetamine combo.
3) A medium dosage of a psychotropic agent.

Note, the only drugs here that specifically address my symptoms are the amphetamine and the SSNRI.  Nothing addresses my epilepsy or my social anxiety when you read about their approved uses....If you decide you do need treatment, you have to commit, your doctor has to commit, and all the while you both may have to be open to new diagnostics and ""let's try this"" scenarios to beat it.  

Of course, you may walk in, be diagnosed 100% accurately in five minutes, and take a pink pill everyday for the rest of your life, and never visit a doctor for this ever again.  It's a crap shoot, just make sure your willing to go through with it.  No ""backsides"" with issues like these. 

On the other hand, you may be like me and have to go through a process or finding out what you may have been saddled with, who you feel comfortable with, and those things can be tough and time consuming.  And, since we haven't got Minute-Clinics for brain boo-boo's, you have to put your faith in your doctor. And, i mean YOUR doctor; the one you have decided you can work with, and with the caveat that you have the right to change who you trust at anytime, for any reason. (I'll leave Obamacare / insurance aspect for another day.)

Then BE HONEST with yourself, AND your doctor as it pertains to right NOW.  It doesn't matter if you were diagnosed with psychic-earwigs a few years ago.  Tell them exactly what you feel needs to be addressed as of today, and start your journey to a better place.  As both you and your doctor go through the learning about who ""bicycle-samurai ""actually is as a treatable patient, you can fine tune it as time goes by.  Just don't be afraid to fix you if you need fixing.

"4070","If you're already diagnosed, isn't it already on your health record? Idk what country you're in.

Regardless, your medical records are very confidential and not centralised in some countries anyway. You're not obligated to share those with any employers or anyone in the future. And besides that, ADHD is very common, it's not really much of a surprise these days. Not taking medication for ""this isn't good to have on your medical record"" is one of the silliest reasons I've ever heard.

If you have a medical condition, seek treatment for it. There isn't really a strategy. Does a diabetic who absolutely cannot control their blood glucose levels refuse to engage in the proper treatment and instead ask for tips? Absolutely not. I know it's not your choosing, but if you have any condition at all and a medical doctor recommends treatment for it, you shouldn't dismiss that advice for any silly reason. Very, very few reasons should override that recommendation, the most notable being either you genuinely don't require it (in which case, they wouldn't advise it), or your doctor is incompetent (in which case, see another doctor). There's few other valid reasons to not take their treatment advice, honestly.

If your parents still won't allow you to seek proper treatment for your condition, talk to someone at your school you trust, or better yet, talk to the doctor who gave you a diagnosis. I wouldn't let it sit there, though. At one point or another you'll be back at this point, it's better now than in 5 years' time (where possible), it would at least mean you aren't being limited by external factors at school and whatnot.","e29x2xq",2,1531425342,"2018-07-12 19:55:42"

I just started Concerta in December and upped my dosage a week ago and most of the changes I've noticed have been related to executive planning, organizing and task completion.  I'm still struggling with concentration during school tasks and initiating when I have to do research and write.  

I've noticed that tasks that require doing multiple things at once and planning are significantly easier.  The biggest changes I've seen are related to cooking and shopping.  Those tasks are so much less anxiety inducing for me know because I an come up with a plan of where to start and now I can manage doing the various tasks at a time.  Last weekend I saw my mom and we went to Macy's and without help I was able to find a bunch of stuff I wanted to try on and do it.  A year ago that would have been impossible and I would have been awkwardly following her around and waiting for cues.  She said I looked like a totally different person.

"4089","A few points:

1. What you feel is valid, hell, what you have written sounds like how I was in school and late teens.
2. I was diagnosed with ""ADD"" when I was a kid, and, honestly, API needs their head examined for a lot of the decisions they made with DSM 5, going with ""ADHD"" over ""ADD"" being one of them. (Studied Psychology, I distinctly remember my lecturer's rant about DSM 5's choices being good but also being bad at the same time)
3. Be glad you have a diagnosis. Seriously. Being male with ADHD with Inattentive subtype tends to fall through the cracks BECAUSE they are quiet.  
4.  If you have not caught on yet, as Jessica of ""[how to ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nPM1_kSZf91ZGkcgy_95Q)"" puts it: ""Welcome to the tribe"". I have Inattentive, I have crap organizational skills but have worked out how to organize myself when I need to, I do enjoy anime/manga as well (I have even travelled to Japan by myself, plan to go there again). The point is, you are with like-minded people, it's okay.
5. Want to DM/chat and ask a few things? It's fine if you do and fine if you don't, don't mind either way.","fix1f9k",1,1582810149,"2020-02-27 13:29:09"

"4091","These apps work for me:

\- I use **google Calendar** because I plan EVERYTHING in my life using google calendar. I set two reminders so I will never forget an appointment. I schedule in travel time before every appointment. It keeps me from being late. Downside is that not all agenda's will synchronize with your phone when you use android, so you have to put your most important appointments in your main agenda.

\- I use an app called **Brain Focus** to plan out study/work time. 45 minutes working, 15 minute break. after three sets of 45/15 mins you get an hour of breaktime. It's automatically set on the pomodoro technique time, which is I think 20/5 mins but those time-intervals don't work for me.

\- I use **Forest** to help me not lose focus during those work-sessions. You choose an amount of time in which you grow a tree. You cannot use apps you have blacklisted during the work session (in my case, whatsapp,  reddit, facebook etc.). If you still go to those apps, your tree will die within a few seconds! You can choose all kinds of cool trees. When I forget what I am doing I automatically grab my phone, then see my tree and think 'Oh yeah! Back to work.'

\- I use **Evernote** to keep track of everything in my life outside from studying. This is very handy because you can also use it on your computer, tablet and other devices. Plus you can even store pictures and (word/pdf) documents. I keep shopping lists, if I think about something during the day I will put it on it so I never again forget it in the store. I use it to organize notes of D&amp;D and seminars and have one dedicated to random thoughts that I don't want to forget, inspirational lists, book recommendations friends give, the possibilities are endless. 

\- I use **Any do** to keep track of everything I want to do. It's an app that keeps track of all of your small to-do's. You can also more or less plan them (today, tomorrow, near future, whenever) but I use it as a personal to do dump which I will schedule in on a specific time using my bullet journal.

\- I use **Google Drive** to store all of my progress of my studies and committees and projects. I force project-partners to use google drive too to keep all of our data/research in one place. You can easily access everything using your phone.

\- Of course I use **Spotify** so I can listen to concentration music without distracting advertisements in between.

\- I have a couple of fixed **alarms** for things that I will forget every time. I most frequently use my washing machine alarm and one alarm in the evening for random to do's that I need to get done that day but am prone to forgetting (sending a mail, replying to a persons text message).

"4106","I'm not diagnosed with ADD but I fit the profile very well, I was sent to an assessment and was told I didn't have it, yet stimulants such as large quantities of caffeine render me very effective. It is what it is. I can relate to your post nonetheless.

I don't know if you do this, I set two alarms whenever I need to go somewhere. I calculate in advance a) how much time it takes me to get ready and b) how much time it takes to get there with a traffic buffer. 

I set an alarm to go off when I need to get ready. I snooze it and use that time to tie up everything I need to. At that point I do not take new tasks, I act as if I'm not there.

The next alarm goes off warning me to leave, fifteen minutes before I actually need to leave. I hit snooze in case I get distracted, grab my stuff and head out the door. 

It took some trial and error, now 90% of the time I'm usually 10-20 min early. 

Deadlines are still an issue. I usually lie to myself about the actual deadline so when I run late I hopefully hit the true deadline.

Other than that I make mistakes, I do my best to acknowledge them, let them go, and move on. Reminding myself of my mistakes and beating myself up over them is a distraction, I need to focus on what's next. Your thoughts lead to actions, if I anticipate failure, I fail. My anticipated outcome is success.

There are still a lot of things I struggle with, I just try to ""hack"" them as best I can.

Going to start off with the ""last 5 years"" comment, as an adult with ADHD, I have yet to meet someone who has developed the condition over the last few years. People I've talked to have, like myself, suffered, and struggled their whole life with this condition. It's not something that just happens overnight. As far as a ""test"", there is no definitive test, or fast results, it took almost 6 months of appointments, interviews, questionnaires and things of the sort to get me where I am now and we are still trying to find a med dose that works for me!

I've seen a lot of posts like these on this sub recently where overwhelmed young people such as yourself seek quick answers and solutions due to ""academic problems"" and wind up making a self diagnosis, follow up with a doctor/psychiatrist and form them selves to the condition, all the while not actually addressing the real root of the problem, weather it be something more complex, or something they just don't want to accept.

It's not going to benefit you in the least to lie to yourself or any other medical professional, take this as you will, I'm not trying to be an asshole or anything like that I'm just offering my opinion, because after reading your post, just kind of set me off.

"4196","Generic drugs are **functionally** identical to branded drugs for **most** people. They do contain the same active ingredient. The inactive ingredients, e.g. the stuff that binds a pill together or the capsule material, may differ. The key pharmacokinetic parameters are very similar to branded drugs - that is, the maximum concentration of the drug in your bloodstream and the total amount of the drug released into your bloodstream are very similar.

The thing is, we still don't understand everything about how humans metabolize drugs. Your body could be doing something unexpected to one of the inactive ingredients. For all you know, your body just isn't metabolizing that generic properly. Thing is, you would need a controlled pharmacokinetic study to establish this for certain. And those are expensive to do.

On the other hand, all drugs have placebo effects. Our psychological expectations about what they do are an inextricable part of how they work. **I am not saying it's all in your head**, but it could, in fact, be partly in your head. And in fact, the drug companies are counting on the fact that people wrongly think that branded drugs work better than generics. Also, there's always some day to day variability in how well we do, even holding medication constant, so it could just be that!

Your options may indeed be constrained by your insurance plan, and you may have to check with them. It's a bit odd that you were switched to a generic without them telling you. Your doctor can make the prescription to be specifically branded Adderall if you wish and if your insurance will allow it. To my knowledge, some insurance companies require people to try a generic and then fail to respond before they'll cover a branded drug - a tactic which does work on average but is not good if you are not average.","e5fke6d",2,1536153117,"2018-09-05 13:11:57"

"4208","It sounds like the biggest problems aren‚Äôt parts of his ADHD, but parts of his personality. His choices sound hurtful. 

One example. Forgetting to do a chore could be related to ADHD. Thinking 10 days is an acceptable timeframe to do dishes is not. Ick. Not to say I‚Äôve never done that when I‚Äôve lived by myself, but even while doing it, I recognize it isn‚Äôt acceptable. That‚Äôs an excuse, especially in a relationship, which are all about compromises.

I think you could post the whole description minus his diagnosis on r/relationships and you‚Äôd get some strong opinions negatively reacting to how he‚Äôs treating you. Refusing to talk to you about his reasons for divorce? Blaming your job for choosing not to discuss his emotional state with you? Those aren‚Äôt symptoms of ADHD, those are symptoms of shirking personal responsibility and  blaming others instead of dealing with things. 

Think of it this way, too. Even if someone does have a psychological disability that causes them to act in hurtful ways you are in no obligation to stay in a relationship wherein you‚Äôre continually hurt, especially if the other person is demanding you do work to understand them, but they‚Äôre not doing work to get better. 

If I were you, I‚Äôd go talk to a therapist. From reading your post, you‚Äôre getting an awful end of the deal. Regardless of whether we have the full story, you‚Äôre noticing and feeling all these things that are hurtful and unfair. That‚Äôs a great reason to talk to a therapist solo, and if you choose to stay together, a relationship counselor. If he or anyone else excuses his behavior w/ ADHD, they neither understand ADHD, nor how healthy relationships work. ","eifg2yy",1,1552484646,"2019-03-13 13:44:06"

I'm still trying to find products that do more than just maintain the current state of my face, without drying my skin out. Because every single lotion I've tried breaks me out too. I swear I probably could have slathered bacon grease on as a moisturizer in my teens and been fine, and now even the highest praised lotions for acne sufferers leave me with a new zit within a day or two.

Unfortunately, this apparently ""just happens to some people"" and all we can do is try to find what works all over again.

1. generic Concerta (methylphenidate ER, 12 hour release). It seemed to work, a little, but it was interfering with my sleep, so after experimenting with the dosage a little, I switched to ...
2. generic Adderall XR. It seemed to work a little, too, and it didn't interfere with my sleep, but as time went on I realized it was making me Very Weird In A Bad Way and didn't help me focus on what I needed to focus on (which is really what I need help with). At this point I lost my job and health insurance, so ...
3. a few months with no medication (except caffeine)! This sucked. My new insurance's diagnosis process was long, and they wouldn't diagnose me at first because of my good grades in school and history of depression. It was kind of a good thing, though, because being without medication for a few months after having been on medication was eye-opening. It had been doing all sorts of things for me that I didn't even notice--keeping my home picked up, being able/willing to plan, remembering to validate parking. Suddenly it was really hard to work out and it took me ages to figure out why.
4. After a few months, I quit my caffeine habit because I'd become tolerant of it and didn't want to increase it to more than 5 cups a day. I thought I might start slowly ramping it up again from 0 as I become tolerant. But, instead, I went to the psychiatrist to try again for actual medication, and for some reason ....

I am unsure though on the actual true outcome of those studies as the ones signing up for the trials are probably the ones struggling the most.

Medication definitely is a tool and not the cure. It helps you go in the right direction. Some of the medications enables you to have the mental reward for doing or achieving something. You then discover there is a reward for doing certain things that once seemed trivial. When everything has no reward and is trivial and not enjoyable or interesting.

i'm really not ready to be depressed again, but all the things i need to do to stop myself from becoming depressed (e.g. workout, make social contacts, fix my sleep cycle) feel impossible due to my inability to ""act"" from the adhd. it's like my body takes no orders from my brain, or at least not the ""adult"" parts of my brain. all i want to do is get that dopamine fix and scroll reddit endlessly. my brain is screaming at me to get up, go outside, start my assignments, leave or i will be late for work, etc... and i just sit there. inert. 

i feel so guilty about how much of a mess the house is, how i'm not texting others back, at being late (much more than usual, which is already 5 mins most days). more crushingly, i feel a deep sense of shame at who i know i am at my core (a genuine, hardworking, kind person) and the person who i am right now (a blob, making excuses, disappointing others, not meeting expectations, etc). luckily i have an appointment with a psychologist this week, and i did manage to exercise today. but fuck, i still feel like garbage. i'm trying to figure out how to convince myself to create better habits so i don't get depressed again, but i can't even fucking create habits to avoid personal disasters. i am, however, terrified of becoming super depressed again; i wouldn't wish that psychological hell on anyone. so maybe this is my wake up call... i hope...","g81wois",2,1602111648,"2020-10-07 23:00:48"

I'm sure your mom is a nice lady but she can kindly fuck off. What an undermining thing to say to someone who is working on figuring things out. 

You need to establish good working habits and a routine that you can stick with. The medications make this process easier. I have found that there is only so much I can do without meds then I hit a wall. The meds don't do the work for you but they bring the wall from 9 feet high to 3 feet high so you can get over your obstacles more easily.

I want to say that in some ways the anxiety about failure is good if it motivates you to keep working on improving things but if it is too much anxiety then it can be debilitating. Keep your responsibilities and work load to a reasonable level so you are setting yourself up to succeed. 

As an example, I started vyvanse last week at 20mg. I had more energy and no fatigue but I didn't really have any other benefits. I took 40 mg yesterday and it helped my symptoms a lot. Except, I felt like I had three major projects that were all equally important (for different reasons) with imminent deadlines (all due today!) because I had fallen behind the previous week. Some level of absurd optimism (or insanity) convinced me that I could do 4-5 days worth of work in 1 day if I organized my time well. Obviously, that did not work out. I got one major project done. I'm happy about that and I'm trying to make good progress on another. There's a lot more work to do and I want to make up for lost time while I can. You (and I) need to remember to also be reasonable to ourselves.

I've been on Focalin for probably about seven years now and Wellbutrin for around three years. I recommend getting instant release pills of whatever stimulant you get along with the extended release. I can actually study in the evening when my main meds start to wear off. 

Come to think of it, I was on Vyvanse for a short period of time, though I had a weird reaction to it. Focalin has worked well for me, so I stick with it. 

All in all, the best advice that I can give is to stick with the meds (unless there's some reason to stop, like a bad reaction or something), communicate with your doctor, and find the meds that balance you out. 

Mind, I'm no doctor, but that's a short bit of some of my experiences with medication. ","d8zpyt6",1,1476929162,"2016-10-20 02:06:02"

"4277","I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way. I will share what has helped me when I am feeling suicidal, but I also want to say that I know it is not an easy switch.

First, would it be fair to suggest that posting this here is a way of saying that you don't want to want to commit suicide?

It sounds like a lot of people put pressure on you to do what they want so that they can be happy -- and then blame you if something goes wrong, right? And sometimes it has made life more difficult for them, but others aren't always good at recognizing that their frustration with you is not the same thing as you doing something bad... is that fair? Certainly, that is how I have felt in the past. I feel like everyone else is just at the end of their ropes with me, and they just want more from me than I can ever give them. And it isn't fair. What if I can't give them everything they want? It isn't fair that that means that I have to be condemned. 

When I let myself feel like it isn't fair, sometimes I can manage to get to a place where I can say, ""Right. And it isn't fair to them that I let them ruin my life either -- they are not able to be compassionate for me in the way I need right now, and that is what they're going to have to struggle with in life. Instead of making them the reason I feel bad, I am going to work on not making promises to them -- and also work on taking care of myself first."" (Just for a cue as to what my tone is when I say this to myself, it isn't the serene voice of a ball of love-shimmers. Frankly, when I am saying this to myself, it is in a kind of snobby superior ""fuck you too"" kind of tone in their direction. But sometimes ""fuck you"" is a healthy response to people who are lashing out. Sometimes you need to show compassion for yourself first.)

Again, easier said than done. It is a change of perspective that sometimes helps me -- but I know having ADHD can sometimes mean being in a very lonely place, if your symptoms get out of control either sometimes or ongoing, and if the people around you are not in a place to be supportive. It's a really really dark place to me. I hope you find your way through.

If dark humor helps -- you might consider that if you're going to piss them off by committing suicide, you might as well first go and do all the other things you haven't been doing because you were afraid of pissing them off... Sit on the couch naked when they're out and tell them about it later? Pee on the toilet seat? Stay out late? (Some of this is tongue in cheek -- if you're a guest there, of course respect their property... but sometimes when I am in that deep of a hole, I can see a kind of freedom in it... because it is almost like I can't make anything worse, so that means I can theoretically do anything. Putting it off for just one more week sometimes is what coping looks like, until the urge fades.)

Wishing you strength -- even if it is hard to feel strong right now. ","ddbankd",6,1486188676,"2017-02-04 06:11:16"

While you are old enough to consent to treatment in many jurisdictions, if you can't access that treatment (for example can't make an appointment or can't afford medication), then whether or not you can consent becomes irrelevant. As far as I see it, you really have two options. The first is to wait until you are no longer dependent upon her, then seek treatment on your own. Unfortunately, treatment can often be expensive and ADHD can hinder your career success and earnings. The second is to pursue legal action against her. She is medically neglecting you and it is having a serious impact on your life. Unfortunately, bringing a lawsuit against a family member is hard on everyone involved. There's also a chance that you'll become an adult before anything is resolved, in which case she would no longer have legal responsibility for you. Either way, good luck.

* Don't self-diagnose. Yes, a lot of the things you've said relate to adhd, but we aren't psychiatrists and neither are you. Go in to your doctor's office with an open mind, do not pre-suppose anything.

* If, after evaluation, your doctor does say you present symptoms of ADHD and puts you on medication, realize that it isn't a magic bullet that will immediately put you on a ""normal"" track. You have learned many habits and personality traits as a result of your symptoms, and you may also have other related psychological issues that will need to be addressed before you will arrive at where you want to be. Such things will take months (if not years) to fully address. I've been evaluated and on meds for 18 months, and I still have a lot of trouble completing long-term goals.

That said, simply knowing that you have a thing you can treat, and knowing that you *are* treating it, will help you massively, in more ways than you know.","c6k6ont",8,1349835670,"2012-10-10 02:21:10"

Forgive my ignorance. I really only just found this sub through a random, old thread and a lot of things here resonate with me deeply. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid but my family, and subsequently I, pretty much ignored it because we figured it was all part of the craze. 

But I‚Äôve sort of drifted through life without even realizing it up until two years ago when I caught on and really started to make changes.. but it‚Äôs been really hard. Especially with interpersonal relationships. I‚Äôm largely a loner, mostly ok with that, but I also feel like I don‚Äôt have much of a choice either. My last relationship went down in flames and a large reason (though not entire‚Äî it would be unfair to blame too much on things I can‚Äôt control) was that I had terrible recall which led to her *dominating* every disagreement or argument we had, not to mention a lot of self doubt. Then I happened on a thread from here which described that exact issue, and I was blown away. So here I am on some tiny subreddit journey, clicking on thread after thread that seem to reflect my own experiences.

I never seriously considered that I had ADHD (despite my brother and my father both being diagnosed, and me being diagnosed when I was in second grade). I ended up reading a lot about it and really trying to understand ADHD and how it applied to me. 
I ended up going to a psychiatrist to actually get tested to get an external opinion before I went to a doctor. Now I take 20mg Adderall once a day (when I have class) and I could not be happier. I think it puts me on the same level with everyone else. I am able to focus on my classes, where as I could never even sit through a 50 minute class before without playing on my phone.
If you think the diagnosis is wrong, go get a second opinion. There is nothing wrong with that. I think you might be being too hard on yourself. If the medicine is helping you, then let it help you. 


To your third point- take a break from taking the meds. Thats what I do. Like ill go a weekend without it and still get my homework done. Granted, it is a lot harder to get going and stay focused on my homework, but I do like to check that I can still get stuff done with out it. It is good to take a holiday from taking the medicine, to make sure your body isn't building up a resistance physically (which is debatable at such a low dose) or psychologically. You are in control of it. If you believe that you can do work without it, then you will be able to. Just check every so often. ","ckyjkjf",1,1412269754,"2014-10-02 17:09:14"

I could state that though, but I'm still figuring out, how to make them understand that without hurting their feelings. I do like them, I just prefer to cook alone and let someone eat with me than letting them help

I will try to make time to watch a video later.  Right now I am doing reddit as a break from other stuff and adding video and analysis and so on is too much of its own side project, until I finish the tasks I need to get done today =P

^(Need to make main stuff a priority or it will never get done due to procrastination and distraction =P )

&gt;4: Are there fundamental interpersonal differences regarding experience of the world? Do different people experience/process/compile the world differently in a fundamental/deep/profound way? How can we really know how someone else perceives the world, apart from my inferences above that if they experience it like me then they wouldn't be able to function like they do?

Short answer is yes.  Proving it is so much harder.

**But side note and I do not want to take what I am about to say too literally** for sometimes you do that =P (tease)

But remember I talked about in the past that Dyslexia, ADHD, and Autism all have 3 seperate patterns of cerebellum issues and they influence different areas of the cerebellum and this explains why these conditions are so often commorbid but also why they are 3 distinct conditions and they should not be intermingled in study but in some people you can have 2 or 3 of these conditions but other people you just have 1.

Well to answer #4 remember we have talked in the past that there are different styles of ADHD and just because one person has this issue another ADHD person can have completely different issues and things like commorbidities such as dyslexia and ADHD and autism but also things like OCD, Depression, Bipolar, etc prove all this that people experience the world differently even though we may be roughly similar overall.

&amp;nbsp;

Well some of the recent stuff in the last 10 year show that Autism and Dyslexia are separate conditions, but sometimes you can have both.  Well one of the brain stuff we noticed as a pattern is with how brain cells are linked to each other show that often there is a spectrum of how these cells can be linked and that autism and dyslexia may be on opposite extremes of this spectrum (correlation wise) with a specific type of brain structure called the minicolumn.  

* A minicolumn is the smallest form of brain circuit capable of information processing, different areas of the brain have different amount of cells in a minicolumn but usually it is 80 to 120 nerve cells to form a minicolumn aka a unit, and then these minicolumns than form a web where they interact with other minicolumns.  So if we have 2x10^10 brain cells we have about 2x10^8 minicolumns

Well there are differences in these minicolumns in multiple disorders not just dyslexia and autism, and understand in these minicolumn structure there seems to be a spectrum of how wide the minicolumns are and how the cells in a minicolumn are organized.  But it appears correlation wise (and correlation is not causation) that often dyslexia and autism are on opposite extremes of these minicolumn structure spectrum.  **Note I am not saying differences minicolumns themselves cause dyslexia or autism** but it is just possibly one of **dozens of factors** that cause these disorders.   But differences in minicolumns influence how people process information, and one of the things is that it can make a difference on how good you are at analysis vs synthesis two different processes but two processes that work together as a team.  (This is reductionist but Analysis is good at breaking down complicated things into smaller things, Synthesis is good at integrating opposing concepts into a greater narrative).

**And this is the part I am afraid you may misinterpret, but we know for a fact microcolumns and differences impact lots of things in the human brain and how individuals process information different.**  We still do not know why this occurs, but we have lots of good theories.  **Now this part I am about to say is scientific theory that is so far removed from the evidence the scientist is just speculating and talking to his peers in a theory paper, but differences in microcolumn stuff may explain why often with autism you can have good analyzers, but differences in microcolumn on the other extreme may make some dyslexics good synthesizers.**

Understand though this part of neuroscience stuff like microcolumns are so basic in our understanding.  Stuff like specific neurotransmitters we know far more about but this microcolumn stuff we really barely know and understand yet.

&amp;nbsp;

My point of bringing up this stuff with dyslexia and autism is to explain people think differently without even realizing it.  Now stuff not involving microcolumns but instead perception show that there are differences in people with how many characters or symbols they read before they try to combine the letters into words or words into phrases or sentences without things like grammar.

Like if I were to give you numbers like 316812915421 different people will break up the too long of a number into smaller numbers like this to help working memory

316812915421 can be broken down into 31-68-12-91-54-21 vs 316-812-915-421.  In fact differences like I am demostrating with numbers are involved with dyslexia vs nondyslexic people where in the language and symbol brain networks in the brain (stuff involving front and back areas of the brain) dyslexia use different areas of the brain more often in some areas and less often in other areas.  

Aka this picture http://www.hoperesourcecentre.com/wp-content/uploads/Brain-Illustration-CellfieldCanada.jpg note this picture is somewhat misleading for dyslexia people still use all 3 areas but 2 of the areas they do not use as well and thus are not shown

I do not have a good picture to demostrate this but dyslexia often try to take on to much information before the brain processes it in the frontal lobe.  Now this has lots of downsides but it also sometimes have advantages where they are using the frontal lobe to help synthesize data and see possibilities that other people did not see for the back of the brain already had preconceived notions.  Aka there is not a good or bad way to do this (aka there are awesome genes DNA wise with language and cursed genes, this is not the case) but instead these language networks have trade offs where if your brain is organized one way vs another has its own advantages of pros and cons

&gt;5: Do you guys agree that emotion/perception cannot be separated? Or is that a nonsensical statement?

Blah blah, lots of philosophers and other stuff have written on this but me personally I believe David Hume got it right where emotions influence perception and vice versa, and that emotions influence reason and vice versa.  Lots of recent neuroscience in the last 15 years but really in the last 100 years back up David Hume (who died 240 years ago).  Note David Hume is so much more than philosophy which has a half a dozen plus topics, self, perception, morality, ethics, religion, responsibility, and so on.  He is a also very important man some people argue one of the fundamental men in economics and also political theory.

Human beings at the core are ghosts in the machine, we are raw animals, but we are also computers, we are also emotional beings, and so on.  Rene Descarte and his form of dualism has many flaws, even though overall society is great to have Descarte add to insight in the human condition and metaphysics but many of his theories of how the human brain and the reality works are just flat out wrong.  The Ghost in the Machine is an excellent takedown of Descarte's form of dualism (trivia note the Ghost in the Machine is where we get the title of the multiple anime and manga series Ghost in the Shell which explores these questions but also how technology is changing all of this and is redefining what is means to be human and how society and humanity are changing due to technology.)

And while many aspects of Descartes is wrong, he is so fundamental in influencing how society turned out.  Newton would not do his physics or calculus without Descartes.  Similar stuff with Lebiniz and calculus.  Descartes also influenced other aspects of math such as Cartesian Coordinates and uniting many apsects of geometry with algebra.

He is so influential on philosphy that he is sometimes called the father of modern western philosophy, since he organized his philosophy in a way that was different and influenced other writters.  Furthermore many of the future writers were arguing against his ideas or in support, so he created the conversation which other people then influenced and build upon.

So while in my opinion Descartes was wrong about so many things like mind and body dualism, I am glad he existed and I honor his ideas even while I reject their validity and say they are flat out wrong.

For one, do you know how lucky you are to live in a place that actually has socialized medicine? If you lived here in the USA I guarantee you would not be able to get any help at all. Take advantage of it and try some medication and therapy. It can't hurt.   
Having no formal education should not block you out of all the jobs. What about one where you have the ability to get fed good food? Working in restaurants may not pay a lot, but there are usually flexible schedules (good for us ADHDers who may hate mornings) and they generally feed you! My husband once had a job at a steak house and boy did he get protein. I know that is a concern for you as you want more of it for the lifting. Plus, a higher protein diet is better for the ADHD. Grocery stores are another one - or if you can take it, butcher shops. They need people who can lift heavy objects.

My one therapist had me do this little test on her tablet where it showed a person's face, said their name and a one sentence blurb about them. It was only 4 people. And then it asked questions about them using their name. I failed miserably. She had me take it again later in the session to make sure it wasn't just performance anxiety. Zero recall. My brain cannot absorb that type of info so quickly. 

Yes, same here. If people are talking about a person enough and the context of what they are talking about is interesting enough (like if something they do impacts me), I can start to recall the name. Or at work with email, some ppl have their picture uploaded so everytime I get an email from them, I see their picture. This helps when I was new to the company. Seems like I need repeated exposure to a person's name before commiting it to memory. Then there are those people that just don't look like their name if that makes any sense.

"4408","New diagnosis here. 3 days ago. 

I'm a recovering opiate addict. Never liked uppers because I never got much out of them. I've been in a substance abuse treatment program for almost 3 years. Quarterly private counseling is part of it.  I had a session 2 months ago and talked about problems I'd been having in my relationship, like the things that my boyfriend had been complaining about. He was tired of me sitting around watching makeup videos, looking at makeup, buying excessive amounts of makeup, waiting until the last minute to do shit, etc. We talked about why I started using opiates in the first place and I told her that they made me feel more productive, that I was actually doing productive things instead of being drawn to one hobby and making that hobby my life. (I learned this was called hyperfocus) I told her about being extremely tired throughout the day but wide awake once I got in bed. She asked me if I'd ever been diagnosed with ADD. I said I hadn't but my son is. She wrote a lengthy email to the doctor about the things I said and her thoughts on the matter. She told me to make an appointment. The procrastinator that I am, made the appointment 2 weeks later, but it was for a month out. I saw her at my next group meeting and she followed up with me and I let her know I have an appointment for end of January. She said no, come next Tuesday and I'll work you into his schedule.  

He's been my doctor for 3 years and every time I've tried to explain to him what had been going on in my head, it was damn near impossible. Until the private counseling session, ADD wasn't on my radar. Once she mentioned it and I read into it more, I've never related to anything more than what I read. I relayed this to the doctor and that, along with her email and his perception on what he felt, prompted him to diagnose me that day. 

I've only just started the medication 2 days ago and I have noticed a vast difference. It saddens me to think that had I been diagnosed earlier I would've never self medicated with opiates for 10 years and I'd have less regret in my life. I'm glad that I can put my finger on the exact problem now though. ","ds9jww6",1,1515218533,"2018-01-06 06:02:13"

"4416","I also think the trauma disorders currently recognized are too narrow. I mean, isn't it basically PTSD and Borderline? (please correct me if I'm wrong!Maybe my knowledge is outdated or previous research incomplete, it would be nice to have a lead on possible diagnosis, although I'm so not ready to seek treatment for it and may never be) And stress, adjustment disorders, anxiety and stuff like that. What if none of them fit? I've also thought about RAD, but my trauma occured much much later and not inflicted by parent/lack of parents.  As someone who has experienced trauma in my teenage years, over a long period of time, as in several years (not of sexual or voilent nature), I haven't found an answer that fits to the ""leftovers"" from that. PTSD is a more one-time-only or short-term life threateing or very shocking and upsetting thing, as far as I know. Borderline comes with many other symptoms other than frequent history of trauma in patients. 


It's interesting with the talk therapy, it's my experience as well. Talking about it makes it worse. I avoid talking about it. I've tried talk therapy, and also talking with understanding friends. It seems like many people think if you talk about it enough, then at one point you'll have ""talked it out"" and can let it go. 


What if the traumatic event can't be re-created or it's too unrealistic to re-create in order to do the trauma-therapy? It does seem quite brutal though, to re-live it and work through it. Not sure I could do that. I've always thought that talk therapy was my only option. It seems like there isn't a fitting diagnosis or treatment. I can't even really say what my symptoms are or how they impact my life, only that it comes up in my mind all the time, nightmares, breakdowns, random feelings of sadness, sometimes I'm having a good day and then a memory pops up and ruins my otherwise good day, playing over the events in my head, memories that I've repressed popping up, obsession about the events. It doesn't fit PTSD, I haven't feared for my life and it was continuously during many years. Not by parents or family members like it often is in BPD (also don't fit the diagnostic criteria for it). Maybe it's depression from the events, but it seems like I think about the events quite a lot for it to ""only"" be a resulting depression.","d9kk0cm",0,1478207503,"2016-11-03 21:11:43"

"4418","Much of his behavior seems very similar to what I went through at his age. I'm almost 28 at this point and wasn't actually being medicated until last year. His behavior is a bit more extreme than mine was in terms of anxiety about change. Things like laundry and chores I can totally understand. 

The anxiety should get better as he gets older as ADHD generally gets easier with age up until it peaks in the mid 30s. Things that were difficult for me in my early 20s are easier now even without medication. Seeing how upset my SO constantly was when I failed to clean or do laundry while she worked and I had off eventually started to stick. 

You mentioned that he regularly seems someone, but I think he needs to work on changing his medication. My dosage and medication still isn't perfect, but when I'm on them it is sooooo much easier to help around the house. It took a bit as we slowly increased my dosage but now I'll just clean a bunch and it feels great. 

Another thing of advice I have is write stuff down. Things that you'd like to work on changing with him and things that upset you. Then maybe give it to him when he has some alone time. That way he can read it over and not feel attacked (not that you're attacking him, RSD and anxiety can wreak havoc on us) and let him mull over and better formulate his feelings and responses.","egqm2qn",1,1550509310,"2019-02-18 17:01:50"

Roughly 30 or so minutes ago I ended up getting hungry again so I was able to eat again. It would be nice if that continues and I'm able to eat around lunchtime every day. My only concern is normally when I wake up I don't give myself enough time to eat so I'm afraid if I don't leave myself enough time then I'll have to take the pill anyway to keep myself from taking it later and being up all night.

So you have problems creating motivation and focus to do work without the pressure of a deadline that your mind can perceive temporally.  That sounds about right as our foresight executive function (IE our ability to plan) is fucked.

"4439","&gt; wake up and have trouble getting out of bed for anywhere between 10 minutes to an hour. It all depends on how bad I have to pee.

Is this common with ADHD? I know ADHD people have a tendency to have sleep problems in general, but specifically with getting out of bed?

All my life, the *absolute hardest* part of my every single day has been getting out of bed. In middle school and high school (I honestly don't remember my situation with getting up in elementary school), my parents would be *yelling* at me to get up. They'd rip the covers off of me. They'd pull my by the leg and *drag* me out of bed sometimes. Quite often my mom would end up driving me in to school because I missed my bus.

In college, most of my missed classes were because I just couldn't get out of bed (not actually being sick). I at least was able to manage though because in most classes attendance wasn't necessary. 

Now that I'm working it's a real problem though. I struggle *so hard* to get out of bed because I just feel *so tired* when I wake up (even if I start to feel more alert as I get moving). Actually getting out of bed is just so hard. I set my alarm for 7:15 AM (which still isn't early enough to get ready and get to bed in time), but don't get out of bed until 7:40 AM. I'm supposed to be at work at 8:00 AM, but I'm leaving to get there at 8:10 AM and often actually there around 8:25 AM. 

This is obviously becoming more of a problem. I don't have my first meeting of the day until 8:30 AM (on Mon/Wed/Fri), but I still don't want to be chronically late for work.

I suspected it could be depression, but I don't know how getting out of bed feels when you're depressed. Is it that you actually just feel *so tired* and *can't* get up, or is it more about the dread of your day? 

I don't know. I just hate it.","d6bwcfc",22,1470842939,"2016-08-10 15:28:59"

That gives me more positive social experiences, which makes me less anxious, etc, etc.

I've actually noticed I'm making more social gaffes than I used to -- because I'm talking way more and putting myself out there. But I noticed people tend to not really care too much -- things I would squirm about as I remembered them later on barely register with other people.

The meds definitely do help though. I can actually tell a story because I can keep my train of thought going. I know when it's my turn to hop into a convo because I can pay attention to social cues now.

But adhd meds can definitely increase anxiety as a side effect. So it's not a cure all for sure.","d9gw0sh",5,1478013437,"2016-11-01 15:17:17"

**try it at ur own risk**

I highly suspect that I have ADHD.My mum and dad usually brush me off when I bring up the topic of ADHD to the table(and I'm sick and tired of being ticked off...I'm saving up some money for my official diagnosis).....I'm at my limits,cuz I have an important exam in next 2 months and I can't study. So I've stealthily bought strattera 40 and 25 mg(with my own money,it costs 4$ here for 10 pills and is made by a reputable brand named intas) from a local pharmacy and am now self medicating.... For now, surprisingly it's working and it's only been a week.I still have my doubts that it may stop working in future and I'll then be screwed big time,but for now I feel content and 'safe'.It's my only hope! 

**Edit**:I know I'm being stupid, but I have no choice!Downvote me all u want!

**Edit2**:if u r in similar situation like me and are willing to take any step possible to become focussed, try /r/DarkNetMarkets.They **illegally** sell ADHD meds without subscription.I haven't tried them as I live in India,and I cannot afford the prices at which they are selling(and shipping) certain meds .Things may be different for u tho!

Also try drinking strong black coffee.It works for some people.Another possibly easy to acquire med u can try is Modafinil,it may work for u,but do ur research first as I haven't tried it myself.

**Edit3**:Lastly,if u r in some school or acdemy,get hold of some one who deals with adderall.I heard it's popular among the students

"4477","To answer your questions:

1. If you have the bipolar gene hiding inside you, then even simple antidepressants can be enough to trigger expression of the gene. 

2. I've had bad major depression, ADHD and overall mood problems since I was a kid. For the most part, I could control it. But, since bipolar fully expressed itself at 26, I have lost interest in everything, my drive has dissipated, I can suddenly break down sobbing in a grocery store for no reason, go psychotic after drinking alcohol, and I began to experience stronger visual hallucinations.

I would say I'm somewhere in the medium to severe range of the spectrum ( not homeless, so it's not that extreme ). People with mild bipolar can often still function without meds; they just deal with a bit more mood swinging. If you end up in the moderate range, then bipolar meds can keep you functioning most of the time. Keep in mind, though, bipolar meds often have some really shitty side effects. If you end up in the severe range, you can take all the meds you want, but you will still watch your mind and life slowly crumble over time. 

3. You can treat all those conditions at the same time. I take Adderall, Klonopin, Lexapro and Lamictal.

I meant SOL for the more severe form of bipolar. Mild bipolar can be controlled with meds, just as well as ADHD and anxiety. But, severe bipolar puts severe ADHD and anxiety to shame. You will never have a decent life, and there will be nothing you can do about it, even on the best meds. You will have to deal with watching your mental stability slowly degrade over your entire life. ","d29fqwp",2,1461101789,"2016-04-19 21:36:29"

"4484","&gt;Technically, this work was supposed to be done over a few weeks. So far I have put at least 12 hours of consistent work into it and have only managed to finish it 50%.
  
Seems about reasonable to me - A couple of hours of work each week would add up over the weeks, so getting 50% done in 12 hours is pretty good, at the very least on par with what I would expect. 
  
&gt;I find this discouraging because I think, ""I should be smart enough to get it done quicker. It shouldn't take me this long! Especially now that I am being treated for my ADHD and I am able to focus."" This makes me feel I am stupid and doomed to fail now because it's too late, or something. It obviously does not help that as a child I was called 'gifted' and praised for my 'intelligence' and excellent marks.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychosocial intervention that is the most widely used evidence-based practice for treating mental disorders. Guided by empirical research, CBT focuses on the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems and changing unhelpful patterns in cognitions (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes), behaviors, and emotional regulation. It was originally designed to treat depression, and is now used for a number of mental health conditions.

"4541","Big HUGS! 

Covid is hitting ADHD people hard. our routines have been scrapped, the socializing we thrived on dimmed, we tend to hyperfocus on situations (good or bad) and get stuck feeling like we cant get out. 

  I am a 28/W.  It is still hard but know you will learn yourself more as you get older. I am still finding microscopic patterns in myself that help me attempt to help myself function/ improve my stat of mind. One thing I think our healthcare/ education system has fallen behind on is explaining how puberty/ women's hormone cycle alone affects ADHD. Estrogen helps you process your dopamine (happiness). I bet the week before your period your ADHD symptoms spike, you feel like your going crazy forgetting things, anything can make you feel like you have failed.  The week before your period your estrogen and progesterone drop causing a depressive state/ aggravated ADHD symptoms. Have ever heard of ""Baby brain"" from women after they give birth? They are forgetful, depressive, tired and have symptoms at times that mimic ADHD because their estrogen and progesterone has dropped/fluctuating and the amount of dopamine they can process has changed. 

I wont pretend my advice is a cure all. This is what has helped me.

1. Work out daily-  college I got into a body building kick. My depression and ADHD symptoms seamed to melt away when I worked out 2 hours a day and ate an extremely high protein and minimal grain/starchy diet.  My best grades in school were when I was in a sport. Whenever you have time do a work out. do 100 pushup or squat challenge a day to start.  10 different times a day do 10 pushups or 10 squats.  Just like muscles your brain improvement wont come overnight be patient. If you forget one day, don't beat yourself up, just prove that you can do it today. Yesterday doesn't matter.  Once the work out is easy add 100 lunges, 100 crunches, 100 mountain climbers.  your waiting for your pop tart in the toaster? do your pushups till it pops out. Commercial on TV? do your next set of pushups.  If you can go for a run before you go to school in the morning? Do it. Feeling like you cant solve the problem your facing? Go for a 10 minute run. Run around your block as fast as you can, distance and time doesn't matter. the fact that you got up and did it mattered.  You don't have to go full body builder or yoga master just do something, anything physical.
2. Journaling- when things are getting overwhelming write every jumbled thought in your brain. Don't worry about spelling, readability, flow or anything. WORD DUMP. Get everything out of your head. Our brains process so much so fast get it out.  Once everything is dumped write compliments or encouragement for yourself. Clear. precise. Even if you don't believe it in the moment. tell yourself that you are worth it, tell yourself your hair was really nice today, tell yourself that you did really well today when you watched jeopardy answering a few questions right. No matter how mediocre the accomplishment. No matter if you actually believe it 100% at the moment. tell yourself that you are worth it. End the journal with positivity that you have created in those last words and leave the jumbled mess of whatever you had to brain dump in the journal. Do you walk away feeling like a sparkling fairy of happiness? NO, i will not sell you fairy tale cures and bubbly everything will be perfect once you do this. But you are better than when you opened that book. 
3. Input from your family. - I do not know your family situation or exactly what they are telling you. All I can say with ADHD we suffer from rejection dysphoria. if you don't know about it look it up. basically we have large reactions to small rejections that may not have even been a true rejection.  It is hard navigating this. Hard to tell when you need to be offended and when you don't. Hard to know when your being gaslighted and when your not. See a therapist. They can help you navigate this. I still struggle with this at times.  They can be a neutral person separated from your world that can see details you cant. Can give you tools to help yourself with this.  On your family side they are probably also not fully educated on what ADHD is. My mother is a TA in an elementary school and helps kids with learning disabilities and developmental disabilities. She had no clue what ADHD did to people. I am still educating her on why I function as I function.

Lastly look up the ADHD Women page. Lots of cool and helpful conversations from a 100% female group.","gftf1uf",1,1607958388,"2020-12-14 15:06:28"

It does a disservice to everyone, if you ask me. It's just an extension of the ""ADHD isn't real, mental health isn't important, psychiatric medicine is bad, etc."" sentiment that is frequently pervasive in society. 

The fact that ADHD is a physical/chemical/brain issue where medication is required to fix properly is not subjective. 

Obviously everyone's experience with individual medications is subjective. It's certainly possible that an individual can try all the options and find them unsatisfactory. 

But that just means that the pharmaceutical options are imperfect and incomplete (they definitely are). 

I'd never have a problem with someone who experiences that. 

What I have a problem with is notions analogous to 'it's better to be unmediated than medicated'. It only serves to enable more people to suffer needlessly. ","cxt4e87",2,1449687465,"2015-12-09 18:57:45"

"4589","I did not get diagnosed until the age of 24 with ADHD. I honestly do not know how I made it to that age without being diagnosed. My parents have more of a holistic view when it comes to medicine. I was taking a lot of herbal supplements to control my emotions and attention span. All of my teachers in elementary school complained to my parents that me fiddling around with stuff on my desk was often distracting others plus the teacher. I used to often have to play with things to prevent myself from getting drowsy during my classes, but I managed to make it somehow lol. Anyways, by the age of 24 I realized that the amount of supplements I would have to take to keep things under control has become costly. I stepped up to the plate (since I was finally old enough to advocate for myself) and went to see a psychiatrist. Went through the cycle of starting meds then adjusting or switching. I also was being prescribed an anti-depressant along side with adhd meds. Ritalin/Concerta nulled my emotions and made things a little bit easier to task and finish until it started to wear off then it would made me feel like I was hung over and dragging my body. My psychiatrist then switched me over to Adderall. It gave me some energy, I wasn‚Äôt feeling any of the high that people talk about, but my attention had slightly improved. I got up to 40mg, at this point my insurance made it a hassle to go up higher. By this point I‚Äôve scanned through many threads and posts(which has been very helpful). My psychiatrist thought another med could be added in combination. I suggested Desoxyn (my Psychiatrist has been in the practice many years and knows the pharmacology well) My Doctor okay‚Äôd it and like many pointed out Desoxyn has very similar chemical compositions to other amphetamines. My insurance did not give me any problems to this change. I responded very well to both  Adderall XR and Desoxyn combined. It also helps to cancel all the negative side effects like the come down from Adderall XR. XR only lasted for about 5-6 hours maximum for me. I usually have 12+ hour days (so you can imagine that this was frustrating) I would describe Desoxyn as being very mellow with smooth transition between actions and maintaining focus and my thought process. The only negative thing I would say about taking Desoxyn is that it would somewhat reduce my energy. I did not have any problems of insomnia with this combination. After much adjusting I found that what works for me is Celexa, Wellbutrin, Adderall XR, and Desoxyn all together. (I also have Depression, Anxiety, PTSD along with ADHD I should add) I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll find this information useful, but I thought I could still contribute my experience. Chemical reacts between person to person really do differ. I hope you can find something that works for you. Cheers!","fg2yzej",1,1580462345,"2020-01-31 09:19:05"

It's  interesting that you've had an MRI. I wonder if the doctors at this place could look at it and point to the problem areas, like in this [article](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/adhd/brain-imaging-data-adhd).

"4593","You're welcome &lt;3

I so empathize with the difficulty communicating!! I hope this doesn't go too far, but I wanted to elaborate in case this is of further use, because of how much what you said (about not wanting to hurt someone's feelings when correcting their behavior) resonated with me. I don't know if this will be anything like your experience, but please feel welcome to share more, if you want to elaborate. I always read messages even if I am not able to respond before too much time passes -- if you do want to share more, I would read it and be sure to at least let you know I did.

&amp;nbsp;

For me, being invalidated my whole life due to undiagnosed ADHD, combined with some of the resulting oppositionality... it meant I learned to invalidate myself by default. It wasn't the intent of my parents, who did love me, or my well-intentioned, overworked instructors, but it was still the impact. So to me, conflict feels like a choice. Validating myself feels like it is done at the expense of the other person -- either I am valid, or they are. It feels like choosing to use my angry feelings to point out someone's failures of understanding or behavior -- which seems cruel when you know how painful it is to have that done to yourself. It doesn't seem fair.

If we think of guilt versus shame -- guilt as ""my behavior was bad,"" leading to the desire and attempt to change behavior; shame as ""I am bad,"" leading to the desire to protect and shield the self from others... I think for those of us carrying a lot of shame, it is inconceivable to imagine someone feeling like a good person when they did a bad thing. How does one know they did a bad thing, and feel bad about it, while still feeling worthy of forgiveness? So it becomes difficult to treat others like they can do this when we can't imagine it -- to tell them they seriously hurt us, as if they can separate a bad behavior from being a bad person. 

Now, sure, people tell us this all the time (that good people can do bad things), but it is like, ""Well, that's all well and good to say when what you do is occasionally leave the mayo out overnight. You have no idea what terrible things I've done. Or, you have no idea how persistently I am doing those things. It isn't just every now and then, it is all the time, and everything."" It's like if we tell someone they hurt us badly, they'll realize they did more than leave the mayo out overnight and will experience feeling like a bad person -- because to us, the rule is, ""Good people do [minor and/or incredibly infrequent] bad things."" As soon as you do something serious or frequent -- especially both -- you're bad.

Right now, my habit is something like composing the following and then saying it to myself (instead of them): ""I know you didn't mean to hurt my feelings or anything, but can I ask you to please not talk about me being smart, or about how that means this will be easy work? I've struggled for a long time, and life has never felt easy, and most of the time, when people have said I am smart, it has meant they think I should have been trying harder when I was trying as hard as I knew how. So when you say I'm smart, it is really hard for me not to hear that as an accusation."" So if I composed that, why wouldn't I say it to them? Because I've accomplished everything I cared about -- they can continue to feel good and not be hurt, and I can feel healed and heard, even if only by myself, instead of risking worse by bringing it up to them. Why would I open wounds I just sutured?

&amp;nbsp;

Two thoughts that have emerged over the many many many years I've been working on this (and I'm still not where I communicate easily with others -- I have a friend who initiated a conflict and then was confused when I assumed she thought I was terrible. I am simply confused that, by her judgment, that was a totally normal conflict that friends can have). Nonetheless, I feel like these have been somewhat helpful in making me a little more willing to communicate, even if it is not yet about the most vulnerable things?

(1) If someone is growing and developing, and they sincerely want to make a difference, and I feel ready to risk trusting that goodness in them, then it may be good for me to share this with them so that they *can* grow further -- and trust them to also know they can change and that I will forgive them. If I do this, and they are capable of learning from it, then I am helping them. And the thought of helping them makes it easier for me to consider telling them. And,

(2) From studying social justice more, I started to recognize the odd contradiction of asking someone to comfort and protect someone who has hurt them -- like if a stranger steps on your loved one's toe and you can see it is bleeding and they're howling in pain, and then the stranger starts crying and wants you to reassure them that they're not a bad person... That doesn't seem right. We should take care of your loved one's toe first! It makes sense to feel bad after hurting someone -- but not to prioritize that over the actual pain of the person we hurt!

But that last one becomes hard with ADHD -- because we can't always be what others want from us, and many of us have been painfully shamed for this from a young age. (An age where we should have been granted some exception to #2 -- in that when we hurt adults, they should have helped us to learn better behavior, and to develop a healthy discrimination between those behaviors and ourselves.) And, understanding that you can't hurt people and then ask them to comfort you, we are left with no one to ask for comfort. We do our best to not hurt others the only way we know how -- we just forgive them for anything they do to us. We don't even have a clear sense that there is an alternative, a middle ground where we point out their behavior and they feel bad about the behavior of hurting us... but then they change their behavior instead of feeling bad about themselves.

I've gotten to where I believe that that alternative is possible, even if I am not quite there yet (though I think I am getting closer, after 2+ years of therapy). I am getting to where I am being emotional and allowing myself to be vulnerable with other human beings -- even if it is mostly via text, and really only face-to-face with my therapist. But it is that which makes me hopeful that if you told your therapist and skills trainer, that they would be able to change. The challenge is that it might not be right away, and there is always a chance that they might not be able to at all -- so there *is* risk, and that could be very painful and invalidating again. So I also believe it is perfectly okay if you take the time to see whether they might be a safe place to take that kind of risk. Even if you bring this up in five sessions, or ten -- if you have come to trust them enough to want to, that suggests you may be able to trust them to care, even if the moment has passed. &lt;3","d80m7pv",1,1474754866,"2016-09-24 22:07:46"

"4595","I personally find this bullshit. It is not okay to be habitually late.  

This is an article geared towards business etiquette but I believe it is incredibly relevant to this issue: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-savage/lateness_b_4169441.html

Being late is not OK. It is a sign that you don't value the time of whoever you're meeting, be it friends, family, colleagues or customers. 

It tells your friends and family that loafing around doing nothing (or surfing reddit) is more important and interesting than spending time with them, you can say that's not the case but as the cliche goes ""actions speak louder than words."" 

It tells your business associates that you are not responsible enough to maintain your own schedule and that you have issues prioritizing and don't want their business, because if you can't deliver yourself on time, how can you be expected to deliver a product on time?

Just like most of us here, I am also an incredibly distracted person, but I am also one of the most punctual people among my friends. 50+% of the time I will arrive within a minute of my stated ETA because I understand what it takes me to get from point A to point B, and I'm usually on public transit.

**Story time!**

I had some friends who were habitually late. We're talking 1-2 hours minimum late. The fact that they lived together made it even worse. We scheduled to meet for a hike at 10AM so we could finish by 2-3pm. My (now ex-)gf and I arrive at 10am to find them watching TV in their PJs. We finally get them going at 1pm (yes 3 wasted hours later) but they say they're hungry now and we should get lunch. Nothing's happening while they're hungry so we go. It's now 3pm, 5 hours past our original scheduled time and we finally head towards the trail head in the local state park. 

On our way up we take it pretty easy enjoying the views etc. We get to the top, snap some pictures and decide we need to head down. 

Whoops, it's late fall so the sun is starting to set early, lets pick up the pace a bit. 

Oh no one has flashlights? Uh... its getting awfully dark and the trail is pretty steep and gravelly in some areas. 

Shit its really dark now. 

What's that ""whomp whomp whomp"" noise? A helicopter? With a spotlight? Must be looking for some idiots who got lost. Good thing we know where we're going.

Oh the helicopter is announcing something over the PA now. Well we can't understand them anyway so lets just ignore it.

Uh... maybe the heli is looking for us.... Two of us should run ahead back to the car to see what's going on....

So a friend and I ran ahead, it's basically pitch black now. As we're on the final stretch back to the car, BAM! we get lit up like the sun was going out of style by the chopper. We arrive in the parking to find a full on search and rescue command center deployed. No less than 2 trailers, 2 tents and 10 rangers, just for the CC. We were then told they were considering sending out a SWAT team and their dogs to search for us. 

Turns out, they had seen our car still parked in the lot even after closing, obviously meaning someone was still on the trail. There were two other groups lost that night so we weren't the only ones.

While it makes a fun story, we were 5 hours late getting started. My girlfriend and I wasted five fucking hours waiting for these people and this wasn't a one off incident. We stopped doing things with these guys since because they obviously didn't feel that we should accomplish anything else during the day when we hang out with them.

"4596","Of course sexism can account for a lot of that. I get pretty tired of being right 95% of the time and still being treated like an idiot child. There is nothing wrong with my long-term memory, but everyone else feels privileged to remember things however they like. I think ADHD just makes it harder to put up with that crap. We want the world to make sense, and we get hung up when it doesn't.

You also might just be the ""goat"" in your workplace. In a toxic work environment, someone usually ends up being the target of bullying by virtue of being different than or less socially involved with the others. I've had jobs where I was treated like a red-headed stepchild, and then when I quit, they suddenly realized how much work I had been doing and tried to talk me into coming back. People just don't think much.

I used to work with a manager who routinely got into a tizzy and decided to yell at someone without paying attention to whether they had done anything wrong. My coworker told me he discovered the solution. ""Just agree with him. He can't handle it."" There's usually a way to get around people when you can't confront them.

The next time I went, I didn't see him directly, but some nurse practitioner who said she didn't need the ""tests"" I had filled out.

I will never be caught in the mundane, bureaucratic machine that churns out tired, productive, lifeless laborers until they finally retire. I'll be a tattoo artist. I'll open a restaurant. Invent a product. A business. Hell, I'll move to the EU and work at a supermarket and live paycheck to paycheck. I'll work an easy job that doesn't kill my soul, and grow a garden and I'll cook and eat fresh food every day.

"4604","I can relate very well with your post, op. 
In highschool, I was always a 'goof ball' and off the wall with friends. My attention was always limited and my thoughts bounced constantly

I guess that the combination makes 'straight laced normal' people see that as less than the standard. 

I never felt smart until college. I've always done fairly well in highschool, but that's only because i just floated by. 

When I got the university, I failed an entire year. 

In this time:
*I truly realized my limitations
*goals that I want to achieve instead of the goals bestowed upon to me by parents. 
*found great friends that respect me
*they realize and openly appreciate my strengths
*currently on a low dose of adderall and have been learning how to actually be productive at 21. 

True friends should build each other up. If something bothers you, tell them. If they don't take you seriously, it might be best to branch out and find new friends that support you in ways you can appreciate.

"4607","You're not alone, at all. I have the same combo (isn't it great?) and I felt a lot better adressing not only the meds, but that combination as a mental state. Because the problem is: when the ADHD brain gets an idea, it goes full on in, guns blazing. It feels awesome, right, because you get stuff done and you are so focused you forget to feel crappy. Also, you feel like you have to get shit done now, before you a) lose focus or b) get depressed again. 

Next day, however, you are totally exhausted and that's where the depression gets me personally (I named my depression Steve, after the Hilarious World of Depression Podcast, I recommend it highly). So, Steve shows up when I'm exhausted, and he says things like ""oh, see who's the big shot now, huh? Yesterday you cleaned the whole house, what are you gonna do now? Loser!""  The thing is, Steve is there because I cleaned the \*whole\* house yesterday, or answered \*all\* the email from a week ago, or ran not only my ususal 5k, but decided to run \*another 10k\* in the afternoon. 

When you have depression, the most important thing is to never get below 30 percent. Imagine you are a car. You need a full gas tank to get where you're going, and it should get you there. However, the engine was installed slightly crooked, and the pipe that is supposed to transport the gas from the gas tank further into the engine is installed to high - not on the bottom, but a little up. So when your gas load falls under 30%, you can't pump any more gas into the engine, even though there is plenty left. That's why you need to stop at the gas station much sooner than the other cars, even though you take the same amount of gas to get to the place. 

Meaning: People might make fun of you for taking a break, and the Steve will too, while you are still in okay shape. Other people get to exhaust themselfs on something, and then rest - with depression, you cannot let yourself get down to 5%, because we don't make it back to the gas station to fill up our tank. 

I bet you know these situations: you were doing so well, and one day, you just can't anymore. And when I mean can't, I mean can't. I know these states - I don't know how you are, but I stop brushing my teeth, showering, cooking, answering my phone. It was a vitious cicle until I realised: it's the ADHD that makes me exhaust myself. 

So now I schedule breaks and I take them, even when I don't want to. It sucks to break that sweet, sweet highper focus, but with depression it's the only thing that works. 

Good luck! It's a wild ride. But really: it's gonna be okay again. Not forever, it's gonna be okay, shitty, great, okay, shitty - but there will always be a next good moment, even if Steve says otherwise. ","ekb8j5f",1,1554643870,"2019-04-07 13:31:10"

"4611","Fellow vyvanse-ian here, I know how you feel. Personally, I don't take mine on the weekend. I consider that my ""me"" time. I try to arrange my schedule/responsibilities in such a way that accommodates my general lack of wanting to do a single productive thing (on the weekend.) To be honest, I've been doing this for three months now and am very happy with the results. Anyways, moving on to some other tid-bits that I want to touch on. Feeling tired: how much sleep do you get on average? Do you find it difficult to sleep while on your medication? I personally do. I take a sleep-aid nightly around 8 and force myself to be in bed by 10:30-11 (I'm a real hoot at parties, I know). That exhausted feeling you experience without your medication can be a good indication of mild sleep deprivation. Normally, you'd have the miracle that is stimulant medication to power through it. Your body has grown accustomed to that miracle. Without it, your body doesn't yet know that it needs to put forth more effort for these task that normally take much less effort (due to the wonders of vyvanse).  In short- Get more and better sleep. 
Exercise: You enjoy working out, which is fantastic. I do as well. I also have trouble finding motivation/energy to exercise without my medication. As such, I plan my exercises during the week, while I'm on my meds. However, things don't always go according to plan. On days that I'm forced to exercise without my meds, I take a pre-workout supplement. These aren't necessarily for everyone, but it helps get me going. I'll go into more detail on the different types, if you're curious. Hunger/dieting: This is where vyvanse and a lot of other medications just plain suck. Personally, I love food. Everything about it is great. Vyvanse makes it very hard to enjoy my one true love. I learned to cope with a high protein breakfast and mid morning snack, fruits and veggies (hopefully some protein, if I'm able to) for lunch, more healthy snacks until dinner,  and around dinner my meds wear off and I can eat normally again. Now, on days without my meds, I can put down some food. I mean.. Like 4k+ calories not including snacks after dinner. ._.  I used to be really bothered by this, especially since I couldn't control it. However, I CAN make the best of it. Could I eat an entire bag of chips in one sitting equalling around 800 cals? You sure bet I could. OR I could woof down some almonds, pecans, carrots, and blueberries for maybe half or less the calories (sorry, don't have exact numbers here), while still feeling just as full as eating that bag of chips. I'm not saying to completely cut out chips, because that's just madness. However, All things in moderation, my friend. If you ever need help or advice on living with vyvanse, feel free to PM.

"4630","I'm reading this through one eye because I did like two things today and then fell asleep at 2pm. I meant to only sleep for thirty minutes. It's now 6pm and I'm trying desperately to peel myself out of bed and get all the things done that I was supposed to get done in my afternoon off. This happens to me almost every day as soon as I stop ""going"". I always come back to thinking I have narcolepsy. 

My doctor thinks that it's because I'm too active and I work too much but even when I'm not working it seems that I only get about four hours of waking energy for every six hours of sleep. If I schedule myself to work through the whole day I'm usually fine but only with a constant feed of caffeine and if I don't take my meds it's a surefire disaster. 

Unlike a bunch of people here I totally peak in the morning. Getting out of bed is a nightmare but once I'm out of bed and have taken my meds, I'm the best version of myself from 7am to about 11am and then it starts to dwindle and I either need to take a second dose or have a coffee, or inevitably fall asleep. I am an independent contractor and I do mostly shift work or I will work for 1-2 hours at a time (personal training, teaching group fitness, and then shift work on top of that.) The craziest thing to me is that I've never slept through a job or anything. This part drives me crazy because it makes me think it's all in my head. If I teach two classes at 6 and 7 am and then do a shift from 7:30-11:30am, I'll go home and fall asleep with every intention of waking up within an hour. Every single time, I will sleep for at least three hours, and I'll wake up periodically because I will set tons of alarms. And I really feel like I cannot wake up! But if I am teaching another class at 5, I will always be able to drag myself out of bed at 4 and make it to work on time. The fact that I can break the cycle for commitments but not for myself really upsets me. (Edit: added this paragraph)

And I have a bad tendency to drive my friends crazy with hoe often I clarify. I've even gotten good at saying a super fast disclaimer (""sorry if i said this before"") before a sentence I know I had asked before but had forgotten.

My only bit of advice is to try to bring notebook around. If he sees you trying this to remember things and still gets angry then you may want to consider getting him better informed on adhd

Im not trying to downplay your end please understand, I'm just voting for the cognitive behavioural therapy way about it. Change the prospective from ""you shouldn't have to apologize"" to ""it's understandable that they may get frustrated, because they are  human too."" Or ""how are ways to better handle this symptom to not empact my so as much. 

I hope the point I was trying to make was made √ó.√ó

"4641","I've spent more of my adult life depressed than not. Anxiety comes and goes, mainly social anxiety. Meds help with anxiety for definite, can't say how much they help for depression because although I'm a bit down at the moment I wouldn't say it was to the point that it would be considered a disorder. My bad feelings are connected to actual real life things rather than just the dark cloud following me around that you get when actually depressed. Not to say that depression can't have a real world source, just that those feelings spill over into the rest of your brain and don't stay contained to the things that are actually getting you down.

There was something interesting I noticed though. A bit of context: I have an immense fear of romantic rejection. Like a phobia. Always had quite a strong fear but after a few pretty brutal rejections it became the single biggest fear in my life. People always tell me ""The worst she can say is no"" but that didn't help because even the tame rejections hurt like a bitch. And from personal experience they can say a lot worse than that. Did some research on it and there's a proposed symptom of ADHD called ""rejection sensitive dysphoria"" which basically means that we feel the pain of rejection more intensely. It's also a symptom of atypical depression. But I liked a girl at work and after 3 years of zero love life I decided not to let my fear be a limiting factor in my life any more. Spent a month riling myself up to ask her out... and then she quit unexpectedly. Had hoped to face my fear head on and ask her out in person but had to settle for a FB message. She said no and was very nice about it but it still hurt.

The next day however I felt kind of okay. Disappointed but it wasn't a big deal. I imagine this is how normal people experience rejection. And then my meds wore off and it all came rushing back and I felt terrible again. So it does give me relief from a symptom of depression even though I can't vouch for it helping with depression as a whole.

Having the contrast of the two different states of mind is useful though. I realise how closely linked the despair is to my feelings of inadequacy and not as representative of how much I like the girl. I've made the mistake in the past of falling for the girl even more after she rejects me and I think that's because what I perceived as heartbreak made me think my feelings for her were more significant than they were. Really they have more to do with how I feel about myself. Doesn't help much when my meds have worn off and I'm lying in bed unable to sleep because I'm obsessing over it.

... Anyway... Sorry that turned into a wall of text.

TL;DR Meds help me with anxiety. Depression? Maybe.","d7tv5to",3,1474328414,"2016-09-19 23:40:14"

"4643","I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a multi-part answer, but I think a lot of it comes down to the fact that our broader knowledge of ADHD is fairly young. That, and many physicians unfortunately are actively working with outdated information - ie, the misconception that ADHD only occurs in children. 

If there are any actual physicians on this sub I would love to hear their take on this. My guess would be that general practitioners and other specialists (outside of mental health) who primarily see adults probably wouldn‚Äôt be as informed about ADHD as pediatricians might be due to the misconception I mentioned before. I can understand if a doctor may not want to treat ADHD if they don‚Äôt know enough about it, but in that instance I would think it should be their responsibility to refer you to a proper mental health specialist. To deny it outright without going through the proper steps to evaluate/diagnose or at least refer you to a specialist is a gigantic red flag.

Unfortunately though, there are still bad actors who are able to pass every trial and get licensed to practice medicine. Specifically with ADHD, I believe the reason it‚Äôs still stigmatized is due to the fact that there are still a disproportionate number of people who go into medicine from inherited wealth and often evangelical backgrounds, and project the notion that less-visible illnesses are the result of one‚Äôs moral failings, despite peer-reviewed data that proves otherwise. Those people absolutely should not be practicing medicine.","gwp3lh3",2,1619981394,"2021-05-02 18:49:54"

(Absolutely no idea if this is definitely how it works and more based on my knowledge, but when I take my meds consistently, my body is down-regulating it‚Äôs dopamine receptors since it‚Äôs already being flooded with dopamine. Naturally on off days, my body is expecting the same dopamine levels but doesn‚Äôt get them, yet still has less receptors due to down-regulation to deal with it, so I feel even more unmotivated than usual, until my body naturally up-regulates again.)

No. Concerta doesn't ""drop"" instantly. It drops over time. The reuptake transporters just start recovering and going back to normal. It's not a jerky change like you seem to imply.

&gt;Food will add some dopamine but in no way to compensate the comedown effect.

No such thing as ""adding"" or ""removing"" dopamine directly where it matters from the stomach. The point about ""food affecting the effectiveness"" is trying to dispel any notion of that. Having your gut activate, which happens because of the parasympathetic system, will also lower activity in the sympathetic system. This will ""lower Concerta's effectiveness"" since Concerta boosts the sympathetic system. Once food is out of the stomach, this ""bounces back"" because nothing actually changed wrt Concerta.

1. Make sure to take it at the same time everyday! Have your meds beside your bathroom sink, that way you have easy access to them :) and if you don't feel like eating a heavy meal just eat a banana and go back to sleep afterwards.
2. **A weird side effect I noticed:** I randomly get depressed when I start taking the medication, this lasts for about a week and afterwards I go back to normal. When I stop taking it the same thing happens. At least for me, this is the one side effect that goes away after a short period, stimulating my brain usually helps.
3. Make sure you have the right dosage, I would say give the medication 2 weeks, if don't feel that it's helping try increasing the dosage but always consult your doctor before you do of course.
4. My appetite gets worse, I only eat breakfast and dinner, but when I stop taking the medication I eat everything in the house.
5. It definitely helps me focus on things I want to focus on, for example I'm not taking the medication right now and I'm struggling to complete this list, but I'll try.

"4746","It's also very important to *not* ascribe more reality to the labels than they actually represent. If I'm interpreting the first part of the comment made by   
/u/lucidhominid as they intended it to be understood, then I think that they're trying to make the point that a diagnostic label is only useful insofar as it results in positive patient outcomes.  


The idea of ADHD even really existing as a well defined thing is kind of problematic in some ways. And that's not a problem restricted to ADHD; that's a fundamental problem that one runs into with a lot of psychological/psychiatric/neurological phenomena (I use the term ""phenomena"" here because I hesitate to call them ""conditions"", or ""illnesses"", or ""problems"", or anything of the sort; we seem to be constantly learning that these things are more prevalent than we initially thought and so I don't know that using words to describe them that imply that they're out of the ordinary is the most correct thing to do). Of course, if a diagnosis like ""ADHD"" leads to treatment that improves the quality of life of patients, then in a utilitarian way, the diagnosis (and thus the label) was a good one.  


But clinging to labels can also be somewhat dangerous because, at the end of the day, labels aren't really an objective measure of reality; they're taxonomy. They're a categorization scheme that represents *our best attempt at making sense of reality*, but that's all they are. New evidence might well conflict with our current taxonomy, and a few decades from now we might well view the thing (or things) that we currently deem ""ADHD"" as several separate things. In that scenario, clinging to a label like ""ADHD"" would not necessarily be helpful because there might well be a better and more specific way to treat patients that would have previously been labelled with ""ADHD"". And even in the present, it's good to recognize that our taxonomic classification schemes aren't (and in fact can't be) perfect; many of the different brain-related phenomena that we currently recognize (e.g. anxiety, depression, OCD, bipolar disorder, ADHD, etc) share common features to varying degrees. As a result, it's not necessarily the case that two patients presenting with effectively the same complaints should be given the same diagnoses and/or treatments.  


I guess my point here is that‚Äîwithout some qualification‚ÄîI disagree strongly with the statement, ""the labels matter in profound ways"". The labels only matter insofar that they're actually useful, and you shouldn't get so hung up on them that you forget that they're merely representations of our best understanding of reality, rather than reality itself.","ft3gq79",4,1591437857,"2020-06-06 10:04:17"

I don't know what meds you are taking but maybe ask your psychologist for a medicine more stimulating like amphetamines (unless you think the meds you are taking now are doing fine).

Also try to make yourself understand why you don't have the motivation. Read/Google how ADHD works and why it could give you a hard time doing certain things. If you know how it works you can work out solutions and talk about it with your psychologist so she/he can also help you.

If he can't get a job that he enjoys, then there's no social life for him.  My other two kids really blossomed once they hit grad school -- socially and academically -- and I want him to experience the kind of people who are in grad school.  I think he's capable of reaching that, if only we can find the combination of meds/exercise/planning strategies that work for him.  And, because he's adhd-pi, then he may have to reinvent the wheel over and over again -- otherwise, he'll get bored.

"4769","I think many times wellbutrin alone is just not enough to help ADHD. Many of us have tried it unsuccessfully. Many docs prescribe it before prescribing a stim. I tried it and it did not work.

That being said, I take cymbalta with my stim (boosts norepinephrine and serotonin) and the combo works great for me. I had anxiety and depression prior to being diagnosed with adhd. When I started stims, I was able to slowly get off of cymbalta and was doing great. But once I started a full-time job, my stress level and worries rose exponentially and the stim was not enough. So I went back on cymbalta and feel much better. So the cymbalta alone was no good for my adhd. But the combo works great.

I think you touched on something very important. Sometimes the stims don't help as much with emotional regulation. Plus with being susceptible to depressive episodes, the wellbutrin is probably helping to normalize you. It's great that you can sometimes go without ur stim and still be able to do things. That's awesome!  So happy you found a winning combination and are feeling better!

It is unsafe to self-diagnose based solely on a list of symptoms, and only in speaking with a psychiatrist or ADHD specialist will you be able to get an objective view on whether you have ADHD or not.

The video is about practical tools that help, and he also explains why we need them, including a nice summary of the real world implications of dopamine.

A lot of games lose steam halfway through the game, with a lack of building tension and/or lack of replayability.

(Don't worry: I always remember that Reddit is not a doctor's office.) 

After **7 days** on 4mg Abilify I've seen zero treatment effects. All I've gotten are some side effects like dizziness/headache as well as anxiety/obsessiveness--it's pretty rotten overall. 

When I initially commenced 2mg Abilify he said it would take 7-10 days for effects to kick in (if I recall correctly). Therefore he will probably tell me to give the 4mg-jump the same amount of time to reveal its effects. 

He told me to look for an improvement on the procrastination/motivation/decision-making side, mainly, and a decrease in anxiety/obsessiveness. 

We may add back a small amount of Wellbutrin (e.g. 50mg) now that Abilify is there to modulate it. Apparently Abilify amplifies Wellbutrin too because  50mg is a tiny Wellbutrin dose. 

He says people rarely go to 6mg Abilify and almost never go up to 8mg. 

Also, we made add Trintellix (Brintellix) down the road for anxiety/obsessiveness. He says that Trintellix is ""serotonin-related"" and would help modulate all three major neurotransmitters (serotnonin/norepinepherine/dopamine). 

Intuiniv is also a possibility, to help dopamine and norepinepherine ""transit the frontal lobe"" better. 

1: What do you think about the possibility that the 4mg Abilify might do **nothing** in itself (or even be a bit negative), except once Wellbutrin comes back the Abilify will **modulate** the noreinpepherine into the **""Goldilocks zone""** such that I return to that **awesome** single-day effect that I got when I increased from 150mg Wellbutrin to 300mg Wellbutrin? 

2: What does my experience so far suggest to you regarding my long-term prospects on medication once we titrate? I desperately hope I'm not one of the 10-15% of ADHD sufferers for whom medications does very little or nothing. My positive medication effects so far have only been two little isolated incidents. E.g. one day after a long Vyv break I took a Vyv 2:00PM and had an awesome 8-hour work period. Apart from that single episode, nothing much good on Vyv, though I remain on it for now. Same thing with Wellbutrin--just ONE fantastic episode when I went from 150mg to 300mg, and apart from that nothing at either 150mg or 300mg. 

3: Obviously they have no idea why 10-15% of ADHD sufferers just don't get better on medication, right? There's obviously something special about that 10-15%'s brains/livers/metabolisms that makes them uniquely unfortunate. Nobody knows, though, right? ","cy3edtj",1,1450448982,"2015-12-18 14:29:42"

"4816","This was my experience too.  I was three years out of college when I was diagnosed.  Barely held onto my first job for a couple of years, and was eliminated in a layoff at the second place because my performance sucked.

An older co-worker pulled me aside at that second job, explained that he had ADHD, that he was pretty sure I did too, and that I needed to go find a doc.  That guy probably saved my career.

Medication helped.  Reading and/or therapy to really understand what the patterns in my mind are helped more.  You have to be conscious of what is going in your head, and be prepared to accept that you aren't 100% in control of it.

I think the key lesson to internalize is that *will power is a limited resource*.  This is my mantra.  Once you realize that you only get so many ""good choices"" in a day, and you start to conciously choose where you expend that resource, things gets easier.

Be *selective* about what you beat yourself up over.  Change one thing at a time (you know... focus... or more accurately, pick something and *stop* focusing on everything else).  Establish one habit at a time.  Once you build a habit, you can keep doing it for free.  Until then, you have to expend that resource.  You need to prioritize what routines are important, and get them on autopilot.  

All the ""usual"" stuff that gets mentioned -- diet, exercise, meditation, organizational schemes, sleep patterns... all that stuff helps if you get it dialed in, but you already know that.

"4825","&gt;**TL;DR:** ADHD is associated with below average IQ. In particular, it is associated with working memory deficits that extend into adulthood. Working memory is a strong predictor of academic success, even stronger than IQ. Education research finds that ADHD is the biggest negative factor a student can be faced with (of those factors studied).

This is very misleading. You could also say: ADHD is associated with above average IQ. And that statement would be correct. But also misleading. 

It's one thing for this to be the theme of some article or academic paper. It's entirely different to post this as the summary to a post in a community for people with ADHD, oftentimes a person's first stop when learning more about ADHD that they might have.

Why?

Consider this case: 

For a Less than 2.00 - 4% of the population.

In this case, did you assume that this 4% of students had the same GPA? Which GPA was it? If its 0, 1, or 2.0 then you'll end up with a different standard deviation each time. Granted your guessing for 4% of the population might not be significant, but you're doing this time and time again with each percentile... setting yourself up for disaster.

In this same way, you can't look at a stepped percentile chart... then derive the average from it. You'll have to make assumptions along the way, and your bias for upper/lower bounds will be reflected in your calculations.

"4863","Kind of off topic but developing and selling drugs in the US is much more expensive then most places, partially due to the FDA and their requirements, partially due to the 20 year max life of the meds, and in a huge part due to potential lawsuits. 

The result of the 20 year life encourages companies (and gives them an excuse) to price gouge as much as possible in order to guarantee their profits before they have to give the drug to all other manufacturers. Also the quicker they get their money back and start making a profit the quicker they can work on another new drug (often for the same thing) that they can then release to make even more money 

Also every successful drug is the result of thousands of failed attempts, tests, etc. Making meds is expensive, but a successful one can pay huge and quickly, if the manufacturer is lucky.

Also the distribution system in the US is pretty jacked up as far as the ""go through 4 or 5 different channels before delivery"" goes. Manufacturers sell to large distributors, they sell to smaller distributors, who sell to company specific distributors who then ship to the stores who then sell to the public. One of the ways Walmart gets their drug prices so low is that they sell them either at cost, or normally at a loss, with the assumption that you will come in and buy a bunch of other stuff that has a higher markup.

&amp;nbsp;

I was on 20mg of Adderall XR for a few weeks. It was good for a while, but after a few weeks I started getting a boost for 2 hours after I took it and then crashing and falling asleep after that 2 hours. I went to my Psychiatrist and he prescribed me 30mg 2x daily. I didn't feel comfortable taking it yet, but one day literally ALL the 20mg did was make me sleepy all day. No focus, nothing. So I switched. 

&amp;nbsp;

It's better, but it's not perfect. I'm apprehensive to try to increase my dosage again but I don't know. I took one a day for a while, but crashing halfway through my work shift got to be really irritating, so I slowly started adding the second dose when I felt the first wearing off. It's not terrible and I don't get sleepy anymore. Until it wears off, that is. Then I crash hard and just want to sleep. I feel like finding the right dose has been so difficult. I don't think it helps that I'm on an SSRI either (30mg Paxil). ","d1yqed7",3,1460398306,"2016-04-11 18:11:46"

It can be a good idea to log what you are accomplishing, and compare with medication vs without. Ritalin isn't intended to simply make you happy, or even give you motivation. It helps normalize neurotransmitter levels in the brain that ultimately help you keep on task. But you have to still push yourself to work. 

If you find yourself chasing that euphoric feeling, that's exactly how addictions start. Let it go.

As for the sadness, you might need to talk to someone about that. Really look at the causes. Is the medication causing it? Does the medication make it worse even though it was always there?

First, write title of paper, and titles of the sections in it:

* ALIENS IN SPACE

* Table of contents

* Introduction

* Question 1

* Question 2

* Question 3

* Conclusion

* References 

Ok, then add a brief note to each section (except heading, contents list, references) that says what should go there. For essay questions it's usually neat to copy paste the question into the section title instead:

* Introduction
*(aliens in pop culture*, *our fear of space*, *what does science say about it)*

* Question 1 - what are UFO's?

* Question 2 - are aliens good or evil?

* Question 3 - Scully or Mulder?

* Conclusion *(how did i answer questions 1-3 and why)*

Ok, now go to the first section and think about the question there, and what ideas you have to write about for that section. Put down a few keywords or sentences so you'll remember for later:

* Question 1 - what are UFO's?

*UFO = unidentified flying object - where does that name come from?*

*Flying saucers - airplanes - alien ships? - falling stars? - tricks the eye?*

*Frauds - sighting UFO's - UFO organisations today?*

Just do the same for the rest of the sections, until you have some keywords to get you started on each one. Then pick a section you're most interested in, pick the first keyword, and research it. When you've read up about it, go back to your section and start writing fuller sentences:

* Question 1 - what are UFO's?

*UFO = unidentified flying object - where does that name come from?*

The word ""UFO"" is an abbreviation for the term ""unidentified flying object"", but is better known as another word for ""flying saucer""...

Do this for all your keywords on that section, and then go to the next section and repeat the process. Before you know it you'll have a rough outline of text for each section.

From here you just look over the text, add references, edit grammar and polish it up a bit into final text. Save summary and introduction until last, you can write them easier when you have your draft to look at and base them on.

You probably do not need to worry.  Like many of us, you're a worrier.  I wasted *years* worrying over things I couldn't control, and it wore me out.  Incidentally, I teach college and I have ADHD.

"4960","I went private after quickly realising that the NHS was going to be a colossal waste of time. 
My GP does my prescriptions so that I don't have to pay private prescription fees, but my GP insists that I'm seem by my consultant on a 6-12 month basis as a condition of them doing my prescriptions (this is normal and is just my GP following the NICE guidelines)

However, I recently discovered that I am able to be referred to an NHS consultant so that my check ups can be done through the NHS... I've elected to stay private.
I've tried the NHS ADHD services a few times in the last 10 years and can honestly say that it's worth saving and paying privately to see a good consultant. The stress of dealing with doctors that think they can simply tell you what is best for you without any consideration for your past experiences or current difficulties is unbelievable.

ADHD Medications can be rough. And the side effects/benefits can be very nuanced depending on your lifestyle, job etc. Everything is a trade off in one way or another and getting it right requires tweaking and changing the meds and dosages, sometimes over long periods of time. The NHS simply do not have the systems in place that allow for those nuances to be taken in to account when you're being prescribed, and therefore you either get lucky, or end up on a drug/medication that causes you more turmoil that the ADHD ever did.

Obviously this is all just my opinion, but it's based on 10 years of experience. 10 years later and I just changed meds again. I'm pretty sure if I'd have been dealing with the NHS throughout that time, I'd of simply given up by now.

Look up some reputable private specialists in your area, give them a call and get an idea of price. You'll want to know the price for diagnosis and the price for each check up appointment, should you end up needing them.

If you can't find one you can afford, push hard with your GP. Express your frustration to the GP. Demand that the doctor provide some evidence that they are allowed to simply tell you 'no' when they aren't ADHD specialists.


Good luck :)

Sometimes I like to put earphones on, and not play any music, cancelling out any outside noise, but just enough to leave some illegible background sounds. If I do ever feel like listening to music while studying or working, I would generally listen to eclectic music.

"5027","Wow that‚Äôs crazy, antidepressants aren‚Äôt supposed to give you a ‚Äúcomedown‚Äù (at least the typical SSRI type), but Vyvanse can. And again, maybe the first medicine you try won‚Äôt help, but the *right* one will. Antidepressants could change your life, and if you just ‚Äúsuck it up and be depressed‚Äù you could end up making some seriously poor decisions. A good antidepressant will help you feel less like physically depressed (low energy, brain fog/headache) and make it easier for your ADHD medicine to work. I honestly think it would be your best bet, rather than switching ADHD medication.

I‚Äôm from the US, so I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like in the UK, but I would ask your doctor about your options for other ADHD meds. I completely and totally get it, it‚Äôs hard to risk making yourself worse when you have work, school, and deadlines, but I made it a lot harder on myself by staying on the wrong medicine.

Also, if Vyvanse makes you more anxious and depressed, Adderall probably would too (they are both amphetamine, just metabolized in different ways). The other option would be methylphenidate (Ritalin or Focalin), which again I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs legal in the UK or not, but I know a lot of people who didn‚Äôt like Adderall but felt much better on Ritalin. Vyvanse certainly has a good reputation, but like I said, it‚Äôs not a one size fits all thing. It may not work well with *your* specific brain chemistry, and that‚Äôs okay. You just have to try a couple different combinations of ADHD pills/antidepressants until you find what makes you feel normal.

Edit: Also, if you really don‚Äôt want to mess with your medication now, because of school, I would use the summer as an experimentation period, since you have some time off from university.","firk4rw",2,1582665906,"2020-02-25 21:25:06"

"5096","Being introverted or extroverted has nothing to do with behavior or being shy - it's where you get your energy.  If you are energized being in groups of people with a lot of human interaction that's extroversion and if that kind of thing drains you, even when you enjoy the event, and you need some down time alone in your head to recoup that's introversion.

You can take an online Myers-Brigs test and see where you fall.

And as Jung (I think?) said no one is a total introvert or total extravert as that person would be in an asylum.  I'm paraphrasing Susan Cain paraphrasing someone else so not a direct quote but the gist is right.

It's just a matter of preference.  My job is about 80-85% working alone in my office and about 15-20% dealing with people when I'm happiest.  When the scales tip and I need to deal with people more I definitely feel it.  

I had social anxiety for most of my life - the anxiety is mostly gone but it's been replaced by social aversion when it comes to new people, new environments, etc.  It doesn't make me anxious as much as I just don't want to deal with it because I hate it.  The discomfort is still there minus the jittery anxiety or pressure.  

TLDR:  Where ever you fall on the introvert/extrovert spectrum you can still manage your social anxiety and it can get much better.

"5102","I experienced this, but I did it both ways. And while short term it was easier to not go to class, long term it was ugh. 
I skipped a lot of class some semesters and went to class everytime for other semesters, so I can attest to way less stress and meltdowns etc. Obviously not meaning to sound like a lecture here but from personal experience it worked better to be present as an ADHD brain. 

As you progress to higher level courses it gets more difficult to cram it all in and they expect more from you. The classes that I was more absent from got harder and soon enough i was paying for my lack of physical presence w failed units bc I just wasn't engaged enough w the content to make up for it w cramming , which got harder and harder to muster the motivation to even do the longer I was away. 

If I went to class, even if I got in late, I wouldn't have to make myself deal with study by myself, and ORGANISING my schedule yuck. If I was there and listening as well as I could, a) I didn't need to study pretty much, b) I was no longer scrambling for info on particulars of each assignment bc I could just ask and c) I didn't have to remember any test dates bc I was already there. I also had a way better relationship with my tutors and lecturers and got way more consideration and patience for my ADHD than if they didn't know who I was. 

The way I did it was I made a friend in each class, or found something on or on the way to campus to look forward to. So if I made it in to class the reward is natural and easy access to the person/thing I like. If there's no one u know in class, see what ur friends are doing, and arrange hang outs/meet ups on campus directly after class, just to make it easier for u to be on campus. Find a nice place to be on campus and take yourself there. 

Cramming like... Worked I guess? But it wasn't the easiest way for sure. If you do deal well intellectually the way it seems like you do, then it's so much less strain on ur mental health to be there, just find a reason to get out of bed/on ur way that works for you. (like I say this but some days, this didn't work, but i aim for most days instead of all days, and it's way more achievable). Its for sure not easy entirely, but it was way healthier for me than the semesters that felt like I was never there. 

I also made way more friends simply by being there, and found tonnes of new interests from the content from my lectures and tutorials.

Basically in summary, sure you CAN cram and get a good grade, but it's genuinely easier to graduate if you can make urself present, and way healthier.","f3svx8g",1,1571110550,"2019-10-15 03:35:50"

Fortunately, once you stop eating whatever you're reacting negatively to, your body should recover.   


The problem is, it's hard to diagnose, and doctors don't really pay attention to it for some reason. You can basically have it your whole life and unless one day you ask a doctor to shove a camera up your butt, nobody will ever diagnose you.

"5169","Hey okay, you seem really anxious, so just remember a few things: 

1. A therapist is a highly trained professional, and it doesn't fall upon you to do their job for them. It's great that you're so introspective, and that will really help you along in the process. Let the therapist ask you questions, and just answer them as honestly as you can. It will take far more than one session to unravel your situation, so be patient, open, and honest. Try not to diagnose yourself. 

2. Choosing a therapist is a process that takes place half before you see them, and half afterwards. Start with personal preference: 
*A. Do you prefer male, or female? 
*B. Younger, or older? 
*C. What are their areas of specialization?
*D. Do they take your insurance? 
*E. Do they have reviews? Read them if they do.

Then you go talk to this person, and see if you click. It usually takes a few sessions to figure this out, and it's something you'll only know once you go. If you don't feel good talking to a particular dr, or it's just not working for you, ask them to refer you to a colleague, *I promise they won't take it personally*. Remember, they're trained professionals whose responsibility is helping you.  



TL;DR
When you go to a therapist, they know what to do with you, so don't worry so much about what you have to say. Choosing a therapist is trial and error, but the first thing you have to base your choice on is insurance, and age/gender/specialization preferences. Good luck! You're gonna be *fine.*

You are awesome. You can do this. You are smart and capable and strong and determined. You rock. 

I have similar negative self-talk to what you mentioned. It's a hard cycle to break. I spent most of the summer I applied to grad school telling myself I was stupid for thinking I could do this, that I'd never get accepted, that I'd never amount to anything, that I was an idiot, that it took me far too long to accomplish tiny, meaningless things, that I'd never be able to keep up with the coursework, that I'd totally fucked up undergrad and ruined my life, etc etc and so forth. 

But guess what. 
I got accepted. Guess what else. I will graduate in December. I made it. I did it. It wasn't easy. But it's not impossible, either. 

You can do it. I believe in you.

I'm not hyperactive, I'm quite smart, and I'm rarely late. So I have fallen through the cracks. But I've realised lately they are all because I'm inattentive, have a high IQ, and have given myself hours to get ready every morning because I hate being late and this shit (life) takes SO much time.

What I thought must be anxiety but never seemed to fit the description, is actually being overwhelmed and is fixed by some time in a quite, dark place. 

What I thought was mood swings is actually hypersensitivity and can be combated by reaching out to the person that upset me and talking to them.

What I thought was rudeness is actually my inability to wait my turn or pay attention.

"5210","From my experience taking Adderall/amphetamine salts 20 mg XR twice a day for the past six years (not methylphenidate, but I assume it's the same). Also, don't listen to me. I'm not a doctor, I'm a rando on the internet:

You have a medical reason to take speed for the rest of your life, and it helps you rather than hurts you the way it hurts recreational users. It boosts your metabolism, so it's a lot easier to lose weight.  It boosts your cognition and reaction time. You will read more books, and get more out of them. You will remember things you used to forget. You will be present, and feel more alive. Things that used to be intolerably boring will now take on new dimensions of intrigue.

You will not be addicted to speed (as long as you stick to your prescribed dosage-and why wouldn't you, if you need a higher dosage, just ask your physician), because of your ADHD, sometimes you will forget to take it. (EDIT-You will technically be addicted if you take it every day and have withdrawal if you stop taking it, but think of it being, like, a free-range, farm-to-table addiction instead of the selling-your-children-as-sex-slaves-for-bathroom-meth kind).

Also, you eat food to live, so you're already on meds the rest of your life. Everything you ingest is a drug. Know anyone who drinks at least one beer a day? They're self-medicating, for something at least. Know anyone who exercises? They're on a med, too. Anyone who says they don't take meds is naive at best, or trying to sell you on anti-vaxxer/ADHD isn't real/millenials are ruining the workforce/TROPHIES bullshit at worse.

If you ever give your drug to someone else (and don't, they won't stop pestering you ever, it's illegal, and if you give them away, you don't have enough for yourself), you'll be confused and perhaps frightened by their reaction to it because they get visibly high and hyper, much like someone on cocaine (but less insufferable and more productive). Your own experience with meds (if you suffer from ADHD) will be almost the complete opposite. You calm down, your mind stops racing. You feel like you have more control over your body and your thoughts. 

Here are the downsides I've experienced:

1) Withdrawal. If I forget to take it, or are held up getting a refill for whatever reason, I feel tired and irritable, though my ADHD symptoms make me naturally tired and irritable. Withdrawing causes more irritability, maybe? It's not pleasant, but it's not terrible. It doesn't hurt. I'd compare it to not getting enough sleep.

2) Dehydration: I need to drink a lot of water, though I usually don't. You'll need to piss a lot, and perhaps need to shit more, too.

3) Temperature now fucks with you more: You will enjoy A/C, and most places feel like they're too warm (increased metabolism).

I don't mind the drawbacks, so it's been great for me. Others can't stand them.

Ultimately, if your doctor prescribed it, you should at least try it and see how it makes you feel. Other than that, don't let people who don't have any experience with ADHD dictate what you need to do for yourself.

And as I said, I'm a rando on the internet, so don't listen to anything I say. Listen to your doctor (or DON'T listen to your doctor, wink wink nudge nudge reverse psychology'd!).

Best of luck!

Edit-I also probably screwed up with perspective-am I giving advice or explaining my experience? Hence the inconsistent ""me/you."" It's more like I'm talking to myself six years ago when I was first contemplating taking meds. But don't worry, everything I wrote is good advice and works for everyone, because everyone has the exact same reactions to ADHD drugs without any exceptions.*

 Also I would just like to add even if you didn't mention, personally, behind dehydrated and lack of sleep can affect how effective the medication is, so look into that too, even heard citrate causes lesser absorption so yeah just a. Fee things to keep in mind. All the best :)

Citrus and magnesium (tums) can really throw off a day. 

You‚Äôll want to know also what works with and against your medication. 

And if your gp doesn‚Äôt ask - you tell them you want a ekg regularly.  Find out what happens if you lose your script - if there are shortages - how often you need rechecks- and do they drug test at random? 

Above all else - think about hiring out the jobs you really struggle with. Housekeepers are cheaper than shrinks- and so are professional organizers , lawn service, tax pro‚Äôs- whatever weak sports you have. 

Get some spiral notebooks and post it notes. Never take out the pages. Use certain colors for certain things.   

When you make your schedule of things to do -estimate how much time you need in your head -then double it. 

When you are done -write the time finished. 

Time blindness is a real thing. You‚Äôll see where you are chasing your tail. Give yourself breaks- lots of them. 

If you need a sleep med - that‚Äôs cool.  If you are rising twice a day or more - set a cut off time. You miss it -and need to drive -be safe- whatever reason - do it - but if you are at home and no one is counting on you -skip it so you can sleep. 

You will take a double dose one day - it‚Äôs going to happen - ask now what to expect if you do.   We all do it. 

There‚Äôs gobs of apps, tools, supports you can get - backup plans for keys - all the regular stuff. 

Don‚Äôt commit to anything extra whatever you do. The first year of managing is actually pretty hard.  Know who is on your team - and any rules with others on talking about it. 

People are going to say offensive things- even though they love you.   Realize the legal protections are there for a reason.   This is for keeps.  It is at times,  very hard.  

Your new normal type deal.   


The one really horrible thing is to miss an appointment for a med check.  You really do not want to  start over.

Have some sort of communication system for off days or ore medication - I walk out and say : hey look at me - poof I‚Äôm invisible! This is code for give me a half hour to get it together. Everyone respects that.

"5326","An interesting question! I'm about to get tested for ADHD (so no diagnosis yet), but my screen time is way too much as well.

There seems to be a strong link between a lot of screen time and ADHD. Of course people with ADHD are more prone to addictions, so I guess excessive gaming or internet use happens more often for them.

But it also seems that too much screen time itself can make ADHD symptoms worse or create symptoms in otherwise healthy individuals that appear similar to ADHD. There are several studies about that and it does sound likely to me.

Stuff like video games and the internet are basically dopamine machines AND they have a lot of things going on at the same time (e.g. ego shooter games, surfing the web with multiple tabs, surfing while watching youtube videos etc.). So I can totally imagine that the dopamine overload makes impulse control harder and the fast pace and everything happening at once things fractures one's attention.

Google says... 

*""Those applying for a Tier 4 student visa from 6 April 2015 and coming to the UK for 6 months or longer will be required to pay an immigration health surcharge as part of their visa application fee.*

*The surcharge gives Tier 4 students free of charge access to NHS care in the same way as a UK resident at a hospital, Healthcare Centre or Doctor‚Äôs surgery. However some exceptions exist for expensive discretionary treatments. Some dental or optical treatment and medicines prescribed by the doctor may need to be paid for. (Medicines are collected from a pharmacy)*

*Cost*

*Students will be required to pay ¬£150 per year. For example, if a student is studying for three years the charge would ¬£450 which must be paid at the point of application for a tier 4 visa. This is in addition to the standard visa application fee.*

*The charge for a student studying 6 months or less in an academic year is ¬£75. A student studying more than 6 months in an academic year will have to pay the full annual amount of ¬£150. Tier 4 dependants will also be required to pay the surcharge. Your visa application will be refused if you have not paid the surcharge as part of your application and delayed if you have not paid the correct amount.""*

"5368","TL/DR: The Dr is trying to help. Here's some tips in the meantime.(timers, accept failure, have goals, move on, write everything down, sleep, eat, take a break.) Apps are cool. You can do this.

Ah, I've never had dexamphetamine, and I'm in America so the rules are a different sort of fucked up. Where I am, most ADHD meds fall in what's called 'schedule 2' or 'schedule 1' (there are 5 levels. lower numbers mean higher levels of potential risks and abuse, and lower potential benefit. Not that they don't benefit people, but the risk reward balance is more weighted towards risk). So they are only prescribed one month at a time, use what is called a 'triplicate' form (one goes to you, one goes in your file, and one is mailed to the government from my understanding), and my dr actually mails me mine, because you arnt allowed to fax or email it, and it is a sort of enforced waiting period.

There are increased protocols and rules for how dr/psychiatrists can prescribe these meds, and the risk for the Dr is high as well. If they don't do their due dillagence (making you wait, being careful with raising dosages, making you have other medical tests, etc) not only would they feel pretty bad about anything that happened to you, they could potentially lose their license, be sued, or depending on the level of neglegence even go to jail. Dr tend to be very careful, and its not about not wanting to help you. They are trying to protect you and themselves.

Not knowing much about dexamphetamine, i had to Google. From what i read, it looks like it is only approved for adhd use in children, and the intended adult use is for narcolepsy. And the dosage for adhd 17 and under says only rarely should more than 40mg be prescribed, for adult narcolepsy it says it could go up to 60. It also says increases should be done at 2.5 mg (children) or 5mg (adults) weekly. Knowing what i know and have experienced, that sounds like a kinda-fast schedule of increase. Most psychiatric drugs say it can take 4-8 weeks to see the full effect.

What your dr is doing is called ""using it off-label."" This happens a lot, because some drugs have surprising side effects that are beneficial. Viagra was originally intended to be a heart medication, for example, some birth controls do cool things for your skin or other symptoms, etc. So Drs will prescribe it for reasons that are not on the label, which is usually fine. Problem is, these other uses haven't been studied as much, so with high risk meds Drs are very very careful. If the risk is a rash, no big deal, but if the risk is death (from overdose, heart attack, liver failure, etc) that's a big consideration for drs.

For example: when i got my regular rx refill that I've been on for years, i had to see a new dr because my old one retired. Newguy straight up told me he doesn't like to prescribe meds for adults, repeatedly told me not to sell my meds, warned me not to tell anyone i was taking them because people will steal them, ran me through a bunch of mental tests,  made me take an EKG, and i had to pee in a cup. It felt crazy; like, i just want to be able to live. But it's not personal. He doesn't think I'm a drug addict. He HAS to say and do these things. 

So when Drs don't do what you want, its not because they don't like you, or want you to suffer, or anything like that. They want to protect you, and themselves.

While you wait for your next appointment, here's what i would do.

- Schedule the fuck out of your life. Set alarms on your phone to: wake up, take your meds, eat breakfast, shower, eat lunch, drink water, take your meds again, etc. Set alarms for EVERYTHING and stick to the routine for at least 2 weeks, even on the weekend. It will suck but it will get easier. I use my smart watch which makes it suck less and its Moore subtle.
- Aim for success, but accept failure. Yeah, you want to succeed, but this is a learning process. Don't beat yourself up when you don't meet your goal for the day. Think about what went wrong, and how to fix it. If you miss an alarm, it's ok.
-Have goals. To start, have 1 goal a day. Yesterday, my only goal at work was to make the phone calls I've been avoiding. Everything else was a bonus. Eventually you can add more goals, and some days you have to say ""nope, this is all I've got"", but for now start with one.    
-Don't dwell on shit. Its easy to say, but hard to do. Said something stupid to that girl you like? Its ok, move on. Fell down/ embarrassed yourself? It's ok, move on. Messed up your homework/job? It's ok, do what you can to fix it, and move on. You can't change what you did, you can only change how you do in the future. Move on.
- Write everything down. Repeatedly. I'm not kidding. Post it notes, index cards, whatever. Write it down. Keep a notebook if you want so you can show your dr you are trying.
-Go to bed at a reasonable time. I recommend before midnight, but its your schedule. I would make it 6-8 hours before you have to wake up. Even on the weekends, go to bed on time.
- Eat. I'd say eat healthy(cut sugars and processed food, eat more meat and veg), but if that's too much of a goal right now, just make sure you eat. Lots of these meds make you lose your appetite, and you brain works better with food. Feed your brain. Seriously.
- Give your brain a break. Like, at least an hour a day. Watch garbage tv. Cruise pinterest. Watch funny cat videos. Workout. Whatever you like, put it in your schedule (end of the day, but not while in bed) and set a timer.

Also, there are lots of apps that gameify life and are pretty helpful. I like OurHome because i can set my own goals and rewards, but there's a bunch out there like habitica, habitbull, stuff like that. Search app recommendations in this subreddit for more.

"5369","10mg is a pretty small dose, but sometimes the effects can be hard to notice. Adults on average get 20-30mg, sometimes needing between 40-60. If you don't feel it's working, go back to your doctor and explain this. Generally, most doctors will have you do a 1 month check after starting a new medication to check with you on how you feel about its effect.","dwjo6lt",1,1522438989,"2018-03-30 19:43:09"
"5370","All meds are different. Ritalin/Concerta didn't do anything for me. Vyvanse had very bad side effects. Adderall worked but the comedown was ... torture (headache + rage). Modafinil works, but no one wants to prescribe it for ADHD/ADD despite the fact that it does treat the disorder. There's just no money in prescribing it I guess. Everything works much better in conjunction with exercise but I can barely get myself to go as you all might understand. I also have dietary/health issues that I constantly ""forget"" about which in turn fucks the whole cycle up making me unable to concentrate. The conditioning I have been able to give myself was only when I was under medication. It also doesn't last forever. 

I understand that you can only fight for what you want with the resources at your disposal. I am not making light of this trust me.

"5373","Hey. Working with a similar issue currently. Used to be taking Adderall and it's really ""in your face"" as my psych said. It made me want to do things I didn't really want to do and it seemed fun at the time. 

Now I've switched to Vyvanse as well and it is more subtle. Yes you do have more motivation and clarity and all that but there is none of that ""go getter"" feeling that Adderall gives. So here's what I've figured out for myself. 

I honestly thing the willpower component is something you need to train yourself to do. Meds help but they can't get your crap done for you. You have to sit your butt in the chair and open the book and do the thing. Even if it totally sucks more than anything ever and you're totally miserable. 

I decided to start doing this myself after I started reading about how to develop habits. Like ""OK I'll work on this for 10 minutes and if it's still misery I'll stop.""I've been doing that and it's been very helpful. Of course there is that almost painful feeling when you first start but then your meds kick in and you start becoming focused. 

The other thing I can relate to is getting too intensely focused on stuff and not being able to switch. It's super uncomfortable but I've been using mindfulness during those times. Like ""OK I still feel a pull towards this thing that I didn't finish but now I'm here making dinner. Eventually the feelings ebb.  ","dcd2cg0",1,1484280314,"2017-01-13 04:05:14"
"5374","I wonder why there was no diagnosis? Those sound like such hallmark symptoms. I wonder if there was something they missed or discounted?

Not sure what to recommend since I didn't have options for any of this in school - my coping mechanisms were 1) doing other classwork that was overdue or 2) doodling, drawing notes, or creative writing. I had to fight to get some teachers to allow drawn notes (comic-style) instead of written ones. 

As an adult, I prefer knitting to help keep my brain occupied so I can listen passively (and usually it's enough to keep me awake until a particular idea sparks my interest) - but I work from home, so I'm not sure how something hands-on would work in a classroom setting without being perceived as ""disruptive"" (eyeroll)","g5hntll",2,1600277118,"2020-09-16 17:25:18"

"5376","I'm not a professional or anything, and medication should be talked about with a doctor (please don't automatically villianize it - remember ADHD is a disability and medication can be like when a diabetic uses insulin - just something to get the body towards typical) but one issue with ADHD is that we have a really hard time with any consequences that aren't immediate - both positive and negative.

This means that things like time outs, rewards for good behavior, etc don't work unless they're very, very immediate. I know that some people have created token systems for good behavior that may help. 

Additionally, one estimate is that your 5 year old actually has the executive functioning of a 3 and a half year old - so the structures you'd have in place to help a 3 year old are actually appropriate for your 5 year old, even though they have the intelligence and knowledge of a 5 year old, they cannot easily put what they know into action. 

You mention trying a lot of punishment in your post, which is totally understandable, but I would think about looking into systems with more immediate **rewards**. Remember that the biggest thing with ADHD is that we just can't control ourselves like people without ADHD because the reward center in our brain doesn't function like others. It's harder for us to think and act long term. We need things broken down more, with more rewards.

As an adult, that means I reward myself with things like getting to play another level in Monument Valley if I mow the lawn, or having a sour patch kid once I've written another paragraph.

See if you can find small rewards (or use tokens/stickers to build up to rewards) that you can use when you catch your son being good.

I'm not gonna lie, I'm a pretty avid dog trainer, and I've found it's best so far to think of myself like a dog I would train with a high rate of reinforcement.

See if more frequent rewards for listening, for doing things when asked, etc. help. Also, anything you can gamify? Do it! ","e4o4ipd",1,1534989363,"2018-08-23 01:56:03"

"5382","He thinks its an excuse. He thinks that ""taking drugs to function is weak, and drugs are bad and awful."" or at least some some kind of feeling inside him like that- Would you say that to someone on heart medication?  Would you tell a parapalegic that their wheelchair makes them weak and they are dependent on it and shouldn't use it?  Make no mistake if you have ADHD it is a suprisingly severe disability, I had done a lot of thought and assessment before I got medication and my mind has still been totally blown by the difference treatment makes.  write him a letter maybe, since he won't speak, and lay it all out.  I'll bet any money if you can get through the armor anywhere, enough to educate him a little bit, he will cave.  Filling out a symptom sheet with him answering the questions might be illuminating for him.

""I am your wife, and I am telling you in no uncertain terms that ADHD or not I am struggling.  That is not an excuse or cop-out, this is not a motivational problem, this is not a problem of love for you or our child. I want desperately to be a good mother, wife, and person, but something is wrong.  That should be enough for you to support me seeking a professional assessment on its own.  You can have your doubts about the specific diagnosis or ""self diagnosing"" things with information from the internet, but here are the facts.

ADHD is mostly genetic in origin.  you are born with genes that modify the stimulating system in the frontal brain, leading to a chronic under-stimulation of it.  Growing up with an untreated ADHD parent and/or sibling makes the whole thing worse, as learned behaviors compound the problem. In fact you can put a child without ADHD in a home with untreated members and they will eventually develop it.  Your mother and brother have both been diagnosed, that alone puts the odds that you are ADHD so high that it would be absolutely irresponsible to not go through with an assessment.  ADHD is not the kind of thing that is prescribed based on self-description alone either, and the process of being assessed for it will also rule out any other likely problems, like PPD or whatever other things might explain my struggles.  When I say ""---whatever you said to bring it up---"" what  you should be hearing is ""I need help."" -  No more, no less.  That you would twist such an obvious sign and use it to hurt me, withdraw your support when I need it scares me.  It shakes the foundations of what we have.

I am your wife, and I am telling you that I need your support in this, at least in so far as being assessed by professionals and even helping with that assessment.  I desperately need your emotional support.  In sickness, and in health, those were not just words.  You cannot dictate or choose what illness I may or may not have, neither can I, but recognize that your refusal to acknowledge my self-assessment indicates that you lack a fundamental respect for me, and that regardless of whatever the results of my medical assessments and treatments are this has done real damage to our relationship.


It sounds harsh... i guess it is, but i've seen the inside of homes where ADHD was leading to miscommunication, and these kinds of gross misattributions of malice, willful unreliability, etc.  ... generally it took quite a shove to get enough cooperation between the parties to both get treatment as well as either work through the respect/understanding/supportiveness problems together or in therapy.  



Pulling away in defence because people just can't understand is something I did my entire life pre-diagnosis.  It was impossible to push down those feelings of anxiety and fear when around people who had done this to me, don't let this discourage you, I'm sure there is a way forward to getting his support back, even if that is at the end of assessment and him tucking his tail when he sees the dramatic change (again, if diagnosed. :) ) 

You are going to be okay, one way or another, you can do it, you can make it.

"5411","**Core Reply**: I can browse online for hours, but that is because I can also follow any distracting thoughts whatever direction they lead. I can click several links and open them in new tabs and dive into them -- whereas a book is static. If I get distracted from the book, it isn't ""into"" something else.

With eBooks, I don't know that I would spend more time with them -- I think the lure of being on the same device that I can check my email on, etc., would eventually get too strong and I would be at least quickly checking, if not sucked in. Even on a dedicated reader, I would still be tempted into other books when I hit a focus wall.

**Less-Essential Detail**: With other things on screens -- I've thought recently that I could probably read all the research literature on a topic if there was a way to save and read it and interlink between it fluidly. The big problem for me when it comes to reading research articles is not that I am not interested, it is that my response to that initial interest is to open it up and download it (or request it via interlibrary loan). So the end result is I have a pdf, but I have no compelling trigger for going to open it and read it. And the reference manager I have can allow me to put it somewhere where I can go in to read it but then I get overwhelmed by all of the papers I already have in there and feel like I need to organize them before I can get started on reading any of them because otherwise I'd just be starting arbitrarily and making a tiny and perhaps meaningless dent in the accumulated readings...

If I can get into the topic of the book, physical books work well for me. If I am being distracted, then eBooks feel less aversive, but that is because I don't notice being distracted because there is very little gap between the distraction and starting a new activity on the computer. I don't have the more aversive, between activity kind of sensation of not being able to focus, and yet wanting to latch onto something. I don't have a dedicated e-reader though -- I am not sure whether that would help or not -- I think I would still get impatient with the book sometimes and want to click on another one and go through my library... which would increase the chance that I find *a* book that I get into and read (not possible with a physical book as much), but I think the chances of me sticking with the initial book would be about the same.","d79c6q6",1,1473012876,"2016-09-04 18:14:36"

"5426","I agree, and lifes been that way for as long as I can remember. I still dont have my 'thing'  I get bored super easy. However what I'm coming to realise is that life is just that sometimes. Boring.

I've started as a building apprentice. I get physical exercise and comradery. The guys are tough and I'm being broken down and slowly built back up. Its metaphorically like demolishing a house to then making something new and desirable. I feel like I'm becoming a stronger person because of it. I dont think I'll be a builder forever but it's a damn good job and it pays quite well. I'm not really really into it fully but its growing on me. I realised quite early on that I needed to pick something and stick at it. Even if it's not forever. Once I'm qualified I can always build if I need a reliable job. My point is that I've found the silver lining within what feels like a boring job sometimes. I'm personally getting more out of it than just money. My boss wants to make a man out of me. And to some it's all a social construct but I'm enjoying it and that's the main thing. 

Additionally I've found that I get more joy out of being around people I care about. Helping people and hanging with mates gets me through because it's something I look forward to. If you have a family to come home to you have a reason for doing what you're doing and that can help. 

Have something outside of work to enjoy if you can. Work is exactly that. Work. Work takes work. And work isnt always fun. Just make sure you're doing something. Anything that has linear progression because some people never find that special something. And that's okay. Life can still be enjoyed regardless. 

Lastly the main thing I've starting working on is myself. I'm my own project and putting in effort in that area has been paying dividends. Becoming fitter, stronger and more confident increases lifes overall quality exponentially. I encourage you to keep moving forward and just start something. Its gunna be hard but that's algood cause that's what it's all about. Long term successes feel great","g3kefwg",1,1598948258,"2020-09-01 08:17:38"

"5431","It is, because I‚Äôm not an idiot. 

People with adhd can become dependent or misuse the drug as well. Especially because our impulsivity makes us more prone to addictions. Is every person with ADHD a drug seeker or medication abuser? Absolutely not, not even close. But to say that no one with ADHD is susceptible to becoming addicted to or misusing a highly addictive medication is ridiculous. OP is describing symptoms of drug misuse and withdrawal. He‚Äôs getting advice (that he asked for) based off of what he described. No one is being disrespectful or unkind to him, just trying to help. 

10 days is A LOT to forget (which he himself says he didn‚Äôt forget that frequently and instead purposefully double took his medication) and stimulant medication is not the kind of medication that you can accidentally repeatedly double take without bad consequences. Misuse happens to the best of us, but part of being a responsible medication taker is realizing if we‚Äôre prone to it and finding a way to prevent that, whether it be a pillbox or change in medication.","fhu6wxl",2,1581882669,"2020-02-16 19:51:09"

"5439","I agree, it can hard to judge which amount works best.  The best method I found is:

* Be consistent about my dosage size and timing, for scientific accuracy purposes.  I only change my dose if I've planned ahead that I will change it.
* Keep a daily, short journal to write down some notes.
   * My productivity vs baseline.
   * My physical health vs baseline
      * I also use a fitbit to monitor my resting heart rate, as a marker for whether the medication is wearing-out my heart.
   * My emotional wellbeing vs baseline
   * Any health or situational issues besides the medication that might be affecting the above.

The primary marker though, is my productivity.  As the physical and mental side-effects increase at higher doses, my productivity decreases (even though higher doses often give me an illusory feeling of greater productivity).

I use generic Focalin XR; my preference is for 20mg per day, taken as 2x 10mg XR doses, 6-8 hours apart.  This note-taking process helped me confirm to myself that this amount is optimal which reduces my persistent desire to take extra doses in a foolish attempt to accomplish more by being more medicated (taking extra doses usually just makes me feel psychotic).","gszapla",1,1617239418,"2021-04-01 01:10:18"

First, I believe you need to be careful with melatonin since it can interact w/your thyroid. I think you're supposed to get your thyroid checked before you use it regularly. Personally I prefer kava and valerian root, but only a few times a month  just to calm me down when I'm extra anxious.

Second, I am intimately familiar with your sleep issues. I need prescription meds or I don't sleep. Sadly, it's as simple as that. (Do NOT even entertain over the counter meds--they cause more problems than they fix.) I was nervous about the typical meds due to all the stories so my psychiatrist put me on seroquel (generic). It's actually a bi-polar med but it's really sedating but doesn't have grogginess in the morning. I also feel like it has a calming effect during the day. I started with a low dose and just kept increasing until I got the right dosage--I actually need quite a bit. I recommend considering seroquel. Do you have a psychiatrist? Or a family doc to prescribe? Also, I take straterra in the AM so that seems to counteract any potential weight gain.

"5504","&gt;So I can say my adhd has negatively impacted my life as a whole.

That was my experience largely, growing up.  Life was difficult, everything was hard.  Constant stress &amp; anxiety.  Lots of bad decisions, without understanding why I made them or having full control over them.  Over time, I have been able to switch to a place where ADHD is primarily a positive force in my life, instead of a negative one.  If you're up for some reading, I'll walk you through it!

&gt;How do you be the best YOU?

I have a lot of thoughts on this, so bear with me, as I tend to get hyperfocused on posting &amp; spew out a lot of words, lol.

&gt;My mom told me years ago every doctor &amp; teacher said I‚Äôd never be a fully functioning successful person because my adhd was so severe  
&gt;  
&gt;I try so hard sometimes and I still end up feeling like a complete failure :(  
&gt;  
&gt;My husband is the worst possible person I could have ever chosen to marry and have kids with , he shames me daily, constantly telling me I‚Äôm worthless. Financially controlling. But I‚Äôm stuck because why? I‚Äôm completely dependent on him financially and he keeps s roof over our head and pays the bills. I figured a way to make a little money to have myself. I have a little handmade shop from home.

First of all, I'm very sorry you feel this way &amp; that you're in this situation.  I grew up around controlling, negatively personalities as well, and it really affected me deeply for a long time.  It also took me a long time to learn how to cope with it, but eventually I learned how, and that has made a huge difference in my life!

Second, the good news is, there are steps you can take to overcome this.  Specific, two things:

1. Learning how to have self-esteem
2. Changing your situation

Learning how to manage your emotions &amp; how you feel about yourself allows you to insulate yourself from negativity.  Everyone is sensitive to criticism, but the way you react to it, and more specifically, the way it makes you feel, are both controllable things, which is hard to imagine when you feel bad about yourself all the time, but it's also a really good learning opportunity to understand how to grow as a person into a more emotionally mature adult.

It took me awhile to accept the fact that there would always be jerks in the world, but how I chose to react &amp; feel about those interactions were my choice &amp; that those things were internal to me &amp; not really their fault - there will always be insensitive people out there, and a lot of those people have Bully Radar &amp; can tell when you're feeling weak &amp; use that as an opportunity to stomp all over you.

So, how do you go about implementing change?  For starters, keep in mind that this is a process, like building a Lego set piece by piece -  it's not an on/off switch that you can simply flip.  It's going to take time to build up your internal self-esteem system, which is okay, because it is, in fact, doable!

The first step has to do with understanding mindset.  A lady named Carol Dweck wrote an excellent book on this called ""Mindset"", in which she states that in any given situation, people have one of two mindsets:

1. Fixed
2. Growth

In the book, she introduces the idea that intelligence is not fixed, and that you can grow smarter over time, because our brains have the ability to learn new things.  When you have a fixed mindset, you believe that situations are forever, that things cannot be changed, and that things are simply the way that they are.  In a growth mindset, you believe that things can change and that you can make things change - it won't always be easy, but things are not written in stone.

It's a similar idea to the victim vs. victor concept.  If you have a fixed mindset, it's great because it lets you play the victim &amp; say well, this is how it is, so I guess I don't have to do anything about it!.  On the flip side, being the victor means that you are taking personal responsibility for your actions &amp; your situation, and are willing to work to change things, and are willing to stick with a project until it is completed, even when it gets hard, even when you don't want to.

Don't worry, I do have a long game in mind here, haha!  But you need to understand the foundational concepts first.  Everyone has fixed &amp; growth mindsets about different things - some people say ""oh, I can't cook"", which is BS because *anyone* can cook, but if you choose to have a fixed mindset about it, then that means you don't have to try, which lets you off the hook.  On the flip side, we also have things that we have a growth mindset about, like your handmade shop at home.

So this is kind of the first building block of self-esteem: deciding to have a growth mindset about it &amp; deciding that your goal is to have bulletproof self-esteem &amp; that you're willing to work on it &amp; stick with it until you achieve your goal.

&gt;There‚Äôs so many things that do make me a great person but it‚Äôs like if you surround yourself with people that don‚Äôt accept your flaws due to your condition, how can you even be happy?  Is there such a thing as being happy with ADHD when it so severe it rules every aspect of your life.

Round peg, square hole.  Yes, you can set up your life so that ADHD is more blessing than burden.  But you've been using society's traditional tools to try to manage your ADHD, aka, putting round pegs in square holes.  Ain't gonna work!  You need ADHD-friendly tools instead!  You can still be as successful as other people, you just need a different set of tools to functional at a high-performance level, because doing what everybody else does absolutely does NOT work for people with ADHD, as I'm sure you've found out!

&gt;I guess I just need to know that someday maybe I‚Äôll figure it out and be ‚Äúokay‚Äù . I‚Äôm in therapy so that‚Äôs a step in a good direction but I am very broken. I‚Äôve finally accepted who I am but it‚Äôs people (IE my husband, my mom, sister..)that refuse to accept me are really making me feel like this is it.

Everyone on the planet has issues.  Everyone on the earth is fighting their own personal war.  You are no different than anyone else in that regard.  However, are you fighting your own unique fight, and the way you win is by starting off by recognizing where you're weak &amp; then working on those things, just like you would a muscle.  Every great bodybuilder out there was, at one point, a skinny (or overweight) teenager, but they focused on the areas they wanted to improve at &amp; made it happen!  Likewise, if you're open to it, it's time you learned how to insulate yourself from the negativity around you &amp; how to cultivate a strong, personal brand of self-esteem.

Again, we'll start out with the foundational building blocks of ""fixed mindset"" &amp; ""growth mindset"".  Do those make sense, and can you see how they apply to different aspects of your life?  Spend some time thinking about these concepts &amp; about how you apply them to different areas of your life - your relationship with your husband, with your kids, how you view yourself, your ADHD-I, etc.  Let's start from there &amp; build a solid self-esteem house!","e9v5xdf",3,1542435029,"2018-11-17 06:10:29"

"5514","If I may, perhaps you can look at it as ""1% is better than 0%"". Or rather, ""20% of something is better than 0% of nothing"", that will make more sense. 

Here's the thing: myself included, a lot of us are like you. All or nothing. Black or white. Do it or don't. Do it well and fully or don't. Not doing is better than half assed. We are so allergic to half assed it's ridiculous. We loath half assed jobs. We loath mediocre. Most of the time it's because our brain has already solved, understood, and perceived not just what the job on average looks like, but what it looks like when brilliantly perfectly done. We are not per say perfectionists, but we often can think and see in our mind what a good, or great job looks like. 

We might start it, but as its your case (and mine), we don't finish. Amazing things you wanted to achieve today right? All great things to do, with a purpose, and an impact. IF FINISHED. Otherwise, they are not even great ideas or initiatives, they become a mess. The cupboard half out half unfolded, that's a mess. The novel staying at 3/4, that's pretty much useless. (I say this with all respect and kindness, how it will be seen from outside, while I can't even begin to imagine the amount of work you poured into it! I mean, from outside, the results is something not useable.)

So the 1% or 20% idea goes like this:

- instead of reorganizing the cupboard, reorganize the TShirts only. If it's not a Tshirt, it stays where it is. It doesn't come out. I can guarantee the TShirts will be rearranged or folded or whatever, if you apply the rule (see it as a game, but you gotta be willing to play ok!)

- instead of finishing the novel, finish a chapter. Or a character outline. Or a summary of the novel. Or something that can live by itself, be reviewed, shared, or stand alone and be a piece that exists fully on its own. 

For a few days or weeks, allow yourself to see 20% as a non-shameful, non-lousy, acceptable target. Yes, you know it's not 100%, yes 100% is the norm, and yes you're better than just doing things 20%.  

**Just play the game. ** 20%. A little piece instead of all of it. 5min writing instead of 2 hours to make strides. In 5min you will write nothing you say. Just play the game. Fight your brain. **The brain wants something it can't give you. ** Give it something *you* want. You want to do only 5min. Don't get into what you think is better or acceptable. See it as a game. Just do 5min. Just fold the TShirts..

And you know what, you will not be able to do it at first. 
Either because your brain will keep telling you ""it's all or nothing"", or because you'll be pulled somewhere else and start something else. 

**Ask yourself, how hard it is to do 5min? One drawer or one shelf in the cupboard? Completely that is. **Without taking the entire thing out and at 8pm have clothes on the bed and on the floor and on a basket to wash and..and...  No. Just one shelf. Triaged, folded, organized, **done. **

When I realized how many times I would try to do just one shelf and not succeed, I was able to see that **by wanting to do the entire cupboard I was sabotaging myself. **I thought I was being motivated, and positive and ambitious, and that once done it would be great. And when I'd see it wasn't done I'd tell myself it's because I was interrupted, or something more important came up, or that I made progress on this other thing, or my life is a busy one ok, it's normal, I have so much to do...

Then one day it hit me. What matters is not if I WANT to do things fully and finish them. What matters is WHAT I DO, and I can set MY OWN REALISTIC TARGET.

**And maybe now you see this as lowering your standards. **

But once you get real good at doing 20% and small pieces, your pace will pick up. Once you get used to little done at 100% completion, the confidence, the victory, the progress, will all start to make more sense than whatever it is you feel when you look around at the end of the day and realized nothing has been finished. 

It's not easy, and some of us are good at starting and shit at finishing. Some of us, are shit at starting but once in, can finish. And some of us like me, are shit at both. Identify where you are, and work on what you struggle with, WITH TINY BITES.  

When you read what OP wrote, maybe you think *""yeah ok great, 1%.. As if that's gonna get anyone anywhere. That doesn't work and anyway I need to make a dent in what I need to do. I can't be going percent by percent.."". *Maybe you don't even see what a percent looks like. I mean, ""raise your arm in bed"" is the way to going to the gym, are you kidding me? Well, if that seems insane, how about you wear you gym clothes, your sneakers, and you chill at home ALL DAY in them? Do that 3 times a week every week , I'm pretty sure at some point you will walk out the door while wearing them and go for a run or whatever you might like doing. 

**It's about gaming your ADHD brain to let you do what you CAN do vs what you WANT to do. **

Rewind, start with job sizes you know you can finish. And work up your way from there, if you fail at the next size then you know that's your level: work it until you clear it. 

There's nothing wrong with a 20% level you clear. What's problematic is a 100% level you never get to. ","d89hpmf",17,1475325091,"2016-10-01 12:31:31"

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this is important -- when you first start taking stimulants you'll get a little euphoria for a few days.  That euphoria wears off and you start to feel ""normal"" again, but if you've been keeping a symptom diary you'll see that your symptoms (distractibility, lack of motivation, racing thoughts, emotional dysregulation, inability to focus on reading or conversations, etc., whatever your particular problem symptoms are) those symptoms are not coming back.  **Do not** chase the euphoria.

For me, I have issues with socializing without meds because I can't stay with a conversation and lose track of what people are talking about and what's going on.  Since I spend time with friends in the evenings, an evening dose is necessary.  So, even though I'm on extended release Adderall, my psychiatrist prescribed an additional lower dose for me to take in the afternoon to carry me through the evening.  It's 5 mg XR, which I can sleep on, but it boosts the trailing edge of my 15mg morning dose just enough to keep me from falling apart in the evening.","epzi00m",1,1559666056,"2019-06-04 16:34:16"

You are right, that if she keeps continuing to do it after she apologizes for it, she does not care or there is something preventing her from having control over those impulse reactions.

I would have to fill you in on a lot of the situation, and all the circumstances involved, since everything matters, but this post if one of those last resort type deals.

"5542","What are some things that make you happy? I have been categorizing the different dopamine sources to use at different times, like physical, mental and emotional. The stuff I have to do to be ""productive"" usually fall in the physical and mental bins, like for some chores, slef-care excercise, and work, and I'll use something else from another bin to get me started on those. Eg a quick matcha or chocolate snack to get the kick and jump into work; or something from the emotional bin like, a song, good movie, or affection from my SO to help me get off my but or turn back to my work laptop. Mental kicks for me are when I finish something on my to-do for the household or work, or just sit there meditating or organizing my thoughts with a bullet journal.

I try to frame everything I want/need to do as a different form of being productive, even if it's not what is my MAIN priority, but probabaly my 2nd or 202nd and those small wins let me ease into other things. I find the only times I fall into the rabbit hole of distraction inbetween bursts is when I haven't given myself a different type of dopamine source, as a way to structure the distraction and change up how I am engaged. It'll usually end up being a #250 of my priority list of things to do that has room to wander (like shopping for a hunidifier-- but which should I get??) but if I get tired of that meandering and start feeling guilty (although not too much because it was still something on my to-do), then it's a lot easier to shift to something more meaningful or time-sensitive.

I think all of this has worked for me because of how very structured I've become wirh my bullet journal (a collection for EVERY thought train) and have a huge master task list I defer to to guide my distractions; or how very deliberate I am with what I have around me on my desk and monitors to distract me.","f6mvcc3",1,1572979697,"2019-11-05 18:48:17"

A psychiatrist who specializes in ADHD would be the best option, if you can get that referral. It's still a crapshoot whether they'll take you seriously, though.

Every night, I know I should go to bed at 11 PM, so I can wake up for school by around 6:30 the next morning. I stop playing League of Legends at around 10:30, so I can take a shower. One of two things happen from here:

* Someone's already in the bathroom, so I get lost on reddit, youtube, facebook or some sort of music. I only look up when I start feeling really sleepy, realize that an hour and a half passed, and I forgot to take the shower. I then take a shower at around midnight, and finally get to sleep by around 12:30, if I don't start watching something on my phone.

* The bathroom is empty, so I take a shower. However, since my showers usually last around 20 minutes, I get back to my room before 11. I'll then tell myself, ""eh, I have enough time to watch something really quick.""

"5586","Open shelving, or any other kind of storage that makes the items within visible. Out-of-sight/out-of-mind is a big problem for ADHDers. I have found ways to add lots of open storage with cheap shelving and drawer units from IKEA that can be fitted with mesh or transparent drawer baskets, but having that stuff built-in would be amazing. My apartment has some open shelving in the kitchen above the stove, and we put our dishes and some bulk food items in jars up there. It‚Äôs great to be able to see at a glance that we‚Äôre running low on clean dishes or oatmeal or whatever.

In particular, it would be great to have lots of built-in storage options around eye level, which are things I could add myself with wall-mounted shelves but am realistically never gonna get around to. Also, I would vastly prefer to have more _shallow_ areas of open shelving rather than fewer _deep_ areas of open shelving. Some items actually do need the depth, but the vast vast majority of things I need to store do not, and deep shelves and cabinets are places where my things just get lost in the back. This might require more walls, but I would be okay with that. Even half-walls or free-standing walls to create spaces for ADHD-friendly storage to ‚Äústick to‚Äù would be awesome.

Walk-in closets with built-in open shelving are great; there generally aren‚Äôt those little pockets in the sides of the closet where things get lost. I have a walk-in closet that doesn‚Äôt have a door, which means that the stuff inside is mildly hidden but not totally out of sight. Also, please, lighting is a must in closets, preferably multiple small lights so that bulky objects don‚Äôt just shadow everything. I can‚Äôt find things right in front of me with full lighting sometimes anyway, so hunting in dark closets is awful.

Our coat closet has a regular door, like a room door not even one of those slidey-foldy closet doors (whatever they are called), and it _sucks_. We did a good job of setting up shelving and transparent plastic buckets in there, which is where we keep tools and other home improvement stuff, but the door requires a _large_ amount of floorspace to open properly, which is obviously never clear, so it‚Äôs a pain to get stuff out and put it back away, which leads to random tools floating around in other areas of the apartment for months, and no one can find them when needed. If I had my way, all of the closets would just be open, with no door. Maybe a place to hang a curtain if you wanted, or like a roll-up sorta door like old fashioned writing desks have? Dunno if there would be space for that. Point is: minimal floorspace required to open closets is ideal. Sliding doors are okay, but I don‚Äôt like that half of the closet is hidden no matter what.

Speaking of desks, I second what others have said about having a space near the door where everything can be set down when coming in, and I think it would be nice to have a desk nook nearby too. Like maybe around the corner so that it‚Äôs not super high-traffic, but close so that mail doesn‚Äôt have to travel far to be processed. And, personally, I think a desk nook that is cut into the wall is pretty great because you can easily block out visual distractions that way.

Also for the front door / garage door / any door that goes outside that will be used for going out into the world (as opposed to just going to the yard or something), having whiteboard paint near it and making the door itself ferrous so that I can stick important stuff to it with magnets would be great.

Not an ADHD thing, but my autistic partner has a hard time when the clutter level rises because it‚Äôs visual noise that he can‚Äôt block out. We used to have a 2-bedroom apartment, and he‚Äôd escape to the second bedroom when he needed to have a clear head, but now our apartment is just two giant rooms, and it‚Äôs hard for him to have a clutter-free sanctuary. So having more divided spaces might help with that, even if the divisions weren‚Äôt full room divisions. This could connect with the thing I said earlier about making spaces for shallower storage that still makes everything visible.

My current apartment has a really big south-facing window in the bedroom, and it makes it really quite hard to maintain a shifted sleep schedule that involves a lot of sleeping during the day. Even if I wear an eyemask, it‚Äôs still bright enough to wake me up. That‚Äôs not so friendly for people who work night jobs, but I do think it has helped me keep a more regular schedule, which tends to make the rest of my life go better too.

Window seats, in bay windows maybe? Someplace where you can sit comfortably to read or do work and feel the sunshine. Depression has high comorbidity with ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions, and sunlight exposure is good for that. Plus I often like working in different places, so it‚Äôs nice to have options for that.

Please no multi-story open areas. I hate those. There‚Äôs so much unusable space, and it‚Äôs hard to clean, and how even do you change the lightbulbs if you have ceiling lights in such a space? I‚Äôm not 100% sure this is an ADHD thing, but I just generally dislike totally non-functional stylistic flourishes like that.

Pet-friendly features. Again, not really ADHD-specific, but a lot of people with various mental health issues benefit from having an animal companion. This could maybe include an area in a ‚Äúmud room‚Äù (for homes with a yard) that could be set up for pet bathing on the floor, rather than the usual utility sink that a pet needs to be lifted into. (Utility sink could be added too if desired.) That would probably also be easier for hosing down shoes and other gear too. I‚Äôm thinking a setup kind of like a Korean bathroom, where the whole area is tiled and the floor slopes down to a drain, rather than having a semi-enclosed area for washing, if that makes sense. I could also imagine building in a pet porch kinda deal, which I know people build for cats, but could maybe also be used as sort of a transitional area for dogs to come and go to the yard, or as a mini greenhouse for people without pets.

Final idea is more fanciful, but in a multi-story home, I would love to have a laundry chute and/or a dumbwaiter. It sounds so silly when I say it out loud, but often the hardest part about laundry for me is taking the folded clothes and putting them away, or gathering and sorting the clothes to wash in the first place.","f3xodk4",1,1571241422,"2019-10-16 15:57:02"

"5591","When I asked my doctor about taking breaks from meds (dexamphetamine) to avoid building tolerance, she said she didn't advise her patients to do so (though she wasn't opposed to it if the patient wanted to), as she felt that being able to consistently perform at a more normal level far outweighed those concerns. In her experience such concerns were not warranted except in situations where the patient had a past history of drug abuse, or patients who had been prescribed too high a dose. With Vyvanse, there should be even less of a cause for concern, as it's a bit harder to abuse or overdose with than straight up dex. 

One thing I think it's good to be aware of is that any initial 'buzz' (physical or mental) you may feel will likely wear off over time. Some patients (I'm told) think that because they no longer feel much of a difference when taking the medication, they've developed tolerance. However, the cognitive improvements may well still be there, and it's a bad idea to increase the dose to chase the high - that's where tolerance/dependence becomes a concern. Measuring performance is a better indicator of whether the drug's still working for you. Mind you, your productivity may peak at first and then settle to a slightly lower level. I powered through so much stuff at first purely because I was so excited about not having to fight myself every step of the way just to do things I really wanted to do. 

Now, obviously these sorts of things are never absolute, and individuals may well have different experiences, but I have not seen any literature suggesting that a regular dose of Vyvanse (or indeed any of the alternative drugs of the amphetamine family) has a particularly high chance of leading to issues with tolerance. Frankly, compared to benzos, the risks seem almost negligible, especially considering that one drug is working for you and the other is only just making things bearable. 

Now, I'm just a random internet person (and not a medical professional in any capacity), so take this as you will. But I would recommend seeing another psych, if that's an option for you. ","ce2s902",2,1387167002,"2013-12-16 04:10:02"

"5640","I know exactly what you mean. After receiving my first prescription I phoned around 15 pharmacies to check if they have ritalin on hand. Most were shocked by my request ""We don't sell such things here"", ""No we absolutely don't have it here"". I could hear their voice tone change the moment they heard methylphenidate, as if I was asking them for illegal drugs. 

Since Ritalin is scheduled in the ""narcotics"" class of medicine only a few pharmacies meet the requirement to sell it to the public. (Dexamfetamine is absolutely illegal here for domestic purchases). I found a few who had the meds in stock, but even when I came to pick-up my prescription I received judgmental, mean looks from the pharmacist. I know i'm young, but cmon it's not your place to make me feel as if i'm a drug junkie. ADHD is not a real disease to most people, but 20 years ago depression was also considered to be a choice of life-style. We've got a long way to go, but places like this subreddit show me that i'm not alone and simply looking for an excuse for laziness.

"5642","Hi congratulations on your accomplishments!  As a mom to kid with ad hd and autism, your story makes me so happy for you!!  First off, your desire to show off is not completely illogical!  There is a reason why people care about ""prestige"" and that is that the impressions of other people will impact your future for the rest of your life and future.  It's simply true that people who go to more prestigious school s will often make better contracts, have an easier time getting a job,  and make more money.  So b you should factor that in.  Secondly, though, how wise of you to realize it may not be enough to make you happy, and to see how hard it may be without your emotional supports!!!   This is 100% true.  I went to a prestigious school my first year without good supports, floundered, nearly flunked, got a medical withdrawal then ultimately transferred to a less prestigious school where I was more comfortable.  So you are so wise for your age to have spotted the issue!!

I think you should first stop beating up on yourself so you can make a wise decision completely objectively.  You see the pros and cons, but now you need to weigh them more thoroughly.  

Knowing the prestigious school will be emotionally challenging are there things you can do to mitigate that, by planning for the problem?  For example, could you and your boyfriend met every weekend by meeting halfway?  Can you find and join a support group in the new town?  Do you have a good anti-anxiety / anti-depression regime right now, which you can commit to continuing no matter what?  (E.g., Daily outdoor walks, a certain minimum amount of social interaction etc.?)  Are your parents supportive?  

I am not sure what you should do, but I can tell you that there is a LOT I could have done in my own case that would have altered things.  Mostly I need more help, needed to know how to be ok with accepting help, and needed to not take on to many things!!  That last point was the thing that messed me up the most.

But the good news is I turned out fine!  That was 32 years ago, and since then I managed to finish school, become a lawyer, get married, have kids, and none of that matters any more, except it was a learning experience. 

 Every choice has good and bad, and there is never a ""perfect"" answer.  We just can't know the future!  So sometimes you just have to pick an answer and hope for the best.  I'll bet that as insightful as you are, no matter which path you take, this will work out well.  üòä

I think you should think hard, but then follow your gut after that and never look back.  Best wishes!","foy6768",1,1588166230,"2020-04-29 13:17:10"

"5645","I learned to accept that I have this disorder and I have it on a very severe level. I have learned that I can‚Äôt expect people and the world to accommodate me because I have something that makes my like tougher than a lot of people. I have learned that I can‚Äôt just go, I have adhd and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I am tired of the negative results I get from that. Yes life is harder but I have to find a way to make it work with what I have going on. The hardest part is habits and things that work for neurotypicals don‚Äôt work for us. So we have to come up with our own that works for us. What‚Äôs awesome is sometimes you can change the environment where the adhd can be a super power. I remember in school they tried to have me learn like everyone else. I struggled and they put me in special classes for learning disabled. I wasn‚Äôt disabled at learning, I just learn differently. For so long because how I was treated in school I thought I was dumb and all messed up. Come to find out I have a superior intellect and can actually learn much faster than the average person but it has to fit for adhd. ADHD can be a massive superpower when you realize that you aren‚Äôt normal and knowing it‚Äôs not that you can‚Äôt do things, it‚Äôs that you can‚Äôt do things like neurotypicals because are brains aren‚Äôt made like that. We are forced to live in a nuerotpyical society that the rules and social rules are built for a different brain so when we don‚Äôt fit we are seen and feel like we are broken, dumb, and not good enough when we actually tend to be superior in many things when we break out off the expectations and norms and create our own for us. My thing is learn everything you can about your disorders because you can learn how to change the environment to work with it where you excel faster than any neurotypical. The world is built for them to succeed so we have to change it for us to succeed. I always think of adhd like the first damn movie. All these kids had superpowers but were trying to live a normal life like others. They were seen as freaks and problematic because they didn‚Äôt fit in with the typical world. They felt they were freaks, broken, and worthless because they couldn‚Äôt be like an average person. Then professor x came around and taught them they are actually special and have gifts no one else has. He taught them how to use them and control them. He taught them how to use their power an excel in any environment. He taught them they are super hero‚Äôs with massive value when before they were worthless and felt they were less.","ggrp4eb",1,1608699288,"2020-12-23 04:54:48"

"5648","Ooh good questions! I‚Äôm not an artist but I do like crafts (cross stitch/embroidery, sewing, etc) as a hobby and definitely struggle with organization.

The best solution I have found is to resign myself to the mess, but make an effort to keep art/craft stuff separate from other stuff. So like, my sewing corner can be as messy as I want, but it can‚Äôt go beyond that point and enter my work area. (That only works if you have the space for it, though. My college dorm rooms were positively littered with layers of craft supplies and school work. Fun times.)

But yeah this is a real struggle. Especially because most people with adhd like things to be out in the open/visible, or else we kinda forget they exist, so most forms of organization that involve *putting things away* don‚Äôt really help.

How beneficial are the benefits when compared against the losses?

Whilst being neurodivergent is challenging in ways that neurotypicals don't experience,  I can honestly say that I enjoy my life. I've never aspired to be typical. In fact, it sounds bloody boring. Rather than a cure, I would like more support so that I, and all neurodiverse people, can live our best lives in whatever way is meaningful to us as individuals. For some, that might be a cure.

Not sure what kind of person your boss is, but start with just asking. Say you'll get more work done in a quieter area, don't say it's because of ADHD, it can be tough for anyone to work if it's noisy. 

If he refuses, then go ahead and get a doctor's note, as long as you're comfortable divulging the info on your ADHD along with it. I was super irritable the first two weeks on Vyvanse and my boss pulled me aside one day like ""so what's up why are you acting like this"" and I decided it would be beneficial for her to know what's going on.

"5687","This isn't a great answer, but I'd usually have someone else talk me through breaking things down.

What's funny is that when friends &amp; relatives are overwhelmed, I can look at it from the outside and help them start whatever THEY need to do, but I can't do it for myself. Never understood why I couldn't sorta ""look at it from the outside"" and pretend it's someone else's issue that I'm helping with, but I can't. :(

So I'll go to my sister or my boyfriend or sometimes even my daughter (she's in elementary school and she's STILL helpful) and they can usually help me figure out where to start. Failing that, I'll just randomly pick something. First thing I can think of that has no prerequisites, I'll start there.

Once you're at a starting place, sometimes index cards help. Write down each thing you have to do (get REALLY granular with it if you need to) and then sorta organize them by what's a prerequisite for what. For example, if you have to clean the living room, you'd want to put ""pick up floor"" (which itself may actually be four index cards - ""put wet towel on the floor into laundry basket,"" ""put game controllers on charger,"" ""put cushions back up on couch,"" ""hang coat up on hook"" or whatever plagues your living room floor currently) before ""vacuum."" 

Either way though, write down the necessary steps as you think of them. We often try to just keep the lists in our brains, but that doesn't work. Our brains can't hold THAT much information that it actually has to use. So you gotta write it down.","cpbyyyu",2,1426114902,"2015-03-11 23:01:42"

"5740","Some things that helped me was focusing on learning and letting my curiosity take me as deep into the subject as i wanted to go.  Once i started studying to learn and not to just pass classes my grades and attitude both improved dramatically.

Some small tips that i learned through years of trial and error, do every assignment as early as you can, if you arent sure about something confirm with your instructor as early as possible.  If you know what chapter you are going over try and read it at least a day before class, this will give you a frame of reference to understand your instructor if your mind wanders you can still get something out of the lectures.

Make an online school folder and keep every assignment you do on a google drive or similar product.   This will help you stay organized and let you go back over your old projects and work when you need to make a resume some day.

On that note make a resume and do real work using applicable classes to your major, this will set you up for success in a lot of ways, for one you will learn more trying to practically apply it, 2 it will be more fun and easier to focus on material you dont like if you use it for a real purpose and 3 it will set you far far apart from the people you are graduating with who probably wont have any work to show an employer when they graduate.  It also gives you a backup if you decide school is not for you, if you drop out early you still have a bunch of practical projects in that field that might help you get in the door without a degree.

If you are a software engineering student and having trouble in physics try and make a physics engine that can simulate some of the problems you are having trouble understanding, if you can teach it to a computer you will understand a lot more about it.  Doing that sooner than later will give you a strong bed of understanding that will help in other courses.  Physics formulas are repeated or slightly changed through a lot of the courses.

Motivation does not come from no where motivation comes from showing up day in and day out and its okay to fail a test or miss a deadline, just try not to let one mistake snowball and become and excuse for others.  Lastly burnout is a real thing and its more dangerous for us, give yourself breaks and understanding.  I read a statistic here the other day that only 5% of adhd people have degrees, its a hard goal, its tough to be on that end of the bell curve but if you put in the work and let yourself be you i promise it can be worth it.","f6tddn1",1,1573147342,"2019-11-07 17:22:22"

"5744","This is a really old post by now, but I wanted to add something here.

Usually, when you hear someone with ADHD complaining of sleep problems, it isn't the quality of the sleep or the inability to stay asleep causing any issues.

It just takes so much longer for our brains to settle down in order to go to sleep than it does for a normal person, and so we have a much harder time *initiating* sleep. 

Once I'm asleep, you can set a cannon off in the room for all I care, it won't bother me. Though, as I lay in bed at the pre-determined time in which I'm expected to become sleepy like everyone else, I can hear a squirrel building a nest in a tree in a forest a mile away from my bedroom.

You're right that ADHD doesn't directly have an effect on sleep, but some of the symptoms of having ADHD definitely do. Part of the core of the disorder is the inability of the brain to automatically trigger behaviors that others have no issue triggering automatically. For a lot of people, this includes a function of the brain in which it begins to slow itself down and set our bodies up for sleep.

A racing mind will keep ANYONE awake until all hours of the night. I'm sure that no one would have a hard time remembering some event they were really stressing over that ended up keeping them awake really late at night. The issue with a lot of ADHD brains is that this happen every night, stress or no stress. My mind's activity level will be roughly the same weather I'm laying in bed stressing out over unpaid bills, or laying in bed wondering how the Chinese came up with their alphabet...thinking of China, how did they ever manage to discover gunpowder? I wonder if anyone's come close to the answer. I should look that up some time tomorrow...and so on until the sun comes up.

Using ear plugs works for people but you will need to use some pretty good ones or it could cause discomfort after prolong use.

At the end of the day you are going to need sleep so I wouldn't be against using some sleep aid meds. Melatonin is over the counter and works well. I use the liquid kind its easy to get an exact dose. You can also use the prescription meds Ambien is popluar but it will last for 8 hours so if you can't always get 8 hours it can cause issues.

"5771","We feel the neurodiversity movement is harmful to people with ADHD. While we share their goals of a society with built-in equitable access and accommodations for people with mental and physical disorders, we disagree that such a society could totally ameliorate all impairments and disabilities. It's just not realistic. Furthermore, we disagree with the different-not-disordered position, that mental disorders are a normal, natural form of human variation akin to race or gender or sexuality. None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily. As such, we cannot in good conscience support it or allow discussion of it on /r/adhd.

Words like 'neurodiverse', 'neurodivergent', and 'neurotypical' are political terms coined by the neurodiversity movement and are inextricably tied to it. They are not general-purpose medical or scientific terms. Please use 'people with(out) ADHD' or 'people with(out) mental disorders' instead.

If you overreact like this and you're aware you're overreacting, it might be that you're already very stressed or have too much ""energy"" and literally anything can set you off. Of course, that is no excuse. 

I'd suggest you to look into techniques to relax, e. g. meditation. There's also ways you can meditate while moving if you have difficulties sitting down and thinking, e. g. things like Tai Chi, or just walking around in nature. 
I can also recommend doing more sports which really helps with getting the excess energy away.

"5798","Thank you so much for sharing this! I actually have a similar [story.](https://story.As) As a kid, I was diagnosed with Aspergers' Syndrome because of my behaviour both at home and in school. My parents, however, took me for a second opinion which led to an unofficial diagnostic note being left in my school file regarding an 'attentional deficit.' Being an elementary kid in the 1990s during the DSM-IV meant I couldn't have both diagnoses though (since co-diagnosis of ADD/ADHD and AS wasn't permitted in those days), so my parents and the school board stuck with AS...and for the most part it seemed to fit. As life went on and moved forward, and as I learned and grew and coped seemingly well enough, no one gave it any second thought.   


...until recently. A few years ago, having discovered a passion for Neurodiversity advocacy in university, I decided to unearth my school record and so stumbled across the unofficial diagnosis. I also interviewed my old therapist around that time...the one who initially placed the unofficial diagnosis in my file... and her explanation confirmed my own self reflections. All of a sudden it all made sense; my lack of organizational ability, struggles at work, etc. The pieces of my puzzle that weren't fully explained by my AS diagnosis now made sense in light of a potential co-diagnosis of ADHD. What followed were years of both completing my book (funny thing, special passionate interests and Aspergers...) and going down the ADHD research rabbit hole. I still think I have both, not one or the other (as the pieces seem to perfectly fit when both are considered), but I'm proud to admit I took a big step this past weekend; I started the process of pursuing an official ADHD diagnosis through my family doctor! I don't know if I feel the need for meds (no hatred or ill will on all those who do - medicine is useful and necessary and nothing to be ashamed of!), but I even think just knowing it's a factor will help boost my success in life greatly.","efqiby9",1,1549301440,"2019-02-04 17:30:40"

## ‚ä≥ Storyline: ##

From Mark Osborne comes the first-ever animated feature film adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exup√É¬©ry's iconic masterpiece, The Little Prince. At the heart of it all is The Little Girl, who's being prepared by her mother for the very grown-up world in which they live - only to be interrupted by her eccentric, kind-hearted neighbor, The Aviator. The Aviator introduces his new friend to an extraordinary world where anything is possible. A world that he himself was initiated into long ago by The Little Prince. It's here that The Little Girl's magical and emotional journey into her own imagination - and into the universe of The Little Prince - begins. And it's where The Little Girl rediscovers her childhood and learns that ultimately, it's human connections that matter most, and that what's truly essential can only be seen with the heart.

"5801","I used to have a problem with that too! After I first got diagnosed my medication made me not think about food and no longer physically hungry. Do you take your medication every day?","g05g6yy",1,1596408486,"2020-08-02 22:48:06"
"5802","What other meds have you tried?","f0r4byj",1,1568873648,"2019-09-19 06:14:08"
"5803","I don't know your room mate but the following may assist you to understand why this happens.

ADD individuals often have poor planning, organisation and time management skills. 

Your roommate might not intend to leave the dishes. It's possible she forgot (I'll do that later, then never remembers). Or is distracted by some other task. e.g she's off to work, then realises she's running late, starts trying to get ready and realises ""crap, there are all the dishes, I don't have time argghh..."", stresses out, leaves for work.  

The intention wouldn't be to not do the dishes. It's just that her attention may be elsewhere.

Now. I have ADHD and using it as an excuse is a bit of a cop out, especially for something like dishes in a shared environment.

If you were my room mate. I would appreciate that you point out when I missed my responsibilities. I wouldn't want to be seen as lazy and would want to do my part. On occasion, I might forget but if you remind me, I'll do my best.

Perhaps see if she is able to have a discussion with you. Try to find some way to help her not be stressed out about household chores. It might be just helping to prepare a plan, so that she knows at 9pm each evening, she must clear the kitchen and first thing in the morning, unload the dishwasher etc. Discuss what she thinks is an appropriate course of action for when she doesn't tidy up.

She still has to learn to overcome her weaknesses, so don't cut her too much slack. Just try to find a way for her to see that she needs to be a responsible individual and offer to help her (not by doing dishes) but by talking her through the issue.

"5811","I completely agree with the rationale, and that clever framework. My issues with my SO have constantly revolved around my bad habits, which I consistently tried to address all at once. Sufficed to say, I would get overwhelmed, give up, and think I was 'deficient' as a human being.

The biggest step that came out of my ADHD diagnosis was the understanding that I just didn't think in the same way that everyone else did. I was comfortable enough to see that it wasn't that I wasn't trying, it's that I need to try harder than most, and find 'my' way of doing it. It gives you ownership over and clarity of your patterns. 

The next step, and arguably the hardest, is to fully address that first habit, and put it to bed for good. Embracing ADHD, and creating systems around your 'improvement points' is a great way of doing it","d7gvc22",2,1473511118,"2016-09-10 12:38:38"
"5812","My 2 cents... 

=In the video linked in the Wiki for this sub reddit, the doctor talks about executive function.  Being able to prioritize essential tasks.  If the meds are working, then part of your brain is able to communicate that you need to do something else that day.  Also on stimulants I feel less anxious.  Add to that some other anti anxieties and I am able to get into and through more tasks in the day that otherwise would send me into Netflix binge or Borderlands farming.

"5821","It goes further when I get annoyed at myself that I *have* to track brushing and flossing when I could be tracking other more important things.  It's made worse when those two seemingly easy tasks for everyone else is a monumental climb for me to even get to.

Knowing that this isn't laziness (after being diagnosed) actually makes me even more mad at myself!! I know there's a problem and I still can't fix it!!?  At least when I thought I was lazy I had an excuse.","gsoqscl",1,1617025803,"2021-03-29 13:50:03"
"5822","In situations like this I always state ""I make mistakes because I'm clumsy, but I am not malicious and I never have the intent of hurting people. Why would I want to hurt them? They're a good person.""

"5823","Not coincidence, it's been known for a long time - but recent years getting more publicity.

Because medical boards are seeing more variations and realising it is not just 1 subset of traits leading to the diagnosis, rather there have always been many but doctors never really focused on 'variables' in the past (this one is my guess), instead only using the core criteria in the DSM to diagnose and treat - overlooking 'individual treatment'.

buy yourself some soundproof headphones - for study/work,
can help a lot

also get enough sleep - tough one but people w adhd need it","d0qzr20",1,1457374253,"2016-03-07 18:10:53"

Going 80mph on a full circle off ramp in my friend's car- REALLY pissed her off. I used to love speeding (I've luckily only gotten one ticket) Tons of near accidents in the snow though from realizing almost too late that traffic had stopped. 
My brother is ADD and has gotten into several SERIOUS motorcycle/bicycle accidents, blew out tires from going around corners too quickly.  ","d2stb67",1,1462389317,"2016-05-04 19:15:17"

"5828","Really have her evaluated for medications. You and she will be so much happier. My daughter would not listen when we were trying to teach her handwriting. She knew best, or so she thought. My SO was very against using meds. After a trial run he was asking me where her medication was. Don't deny her the chance to not have this struggle because you have a stigma attached to it. 

I thought about this for awhile because it was bothering me. But, school work IS the problem. She cannot finish it a timely manner because she is distracted. My daughter was scoring in the top percentile on standardized testing and was actually in the gifted program. But, she could not sit down long enough to complete her coursework and was getting bad grades. So, yes, school work is the problem and she cannot concentrate long enough to get it done. She wants to do the work And she wants to please you, but she really cannot. Imagine how that feels. Actually if you have ADHD you know how that feels. I feel very strongly about this because, as I said, my daughter struggled so much. Medication really helped her and she even attests to that. Nothing wrong with having a trial period and see what happens. Your whole family may be happy with the results. ","cokiuf7",36,1423852955,"2015-02-13 18:42:35"

It still maintains effects that help people with medical issues, but without getting you stoned. I love it, personally.","ci06gsa",3,1402004511,"2014-06-05 21:41:51"

"5834","I'm the same. My doc have me trazodone to help me get drowsy at a reasonable hour. My husband is in medicine so he goes to sleep early and wakes up at the crack of dawn. I'm never ready for sleep when he is so when he gets ready for bed, I get ready too and take a bit of trazodone. I'll read or browse Internet until I get tired. 

Try to get into the habit of waking up early because once you get into residency, you're going to be starting work early... like 7am early.

Edit: there's an alarm clock called the sonic boom that's designed for the hard of hearing. It comes with a vibrating disc you slip under your mattress. That should do the trick, lol.","cucjg4n",1,1440305380,"2015-08-23 04:49:40"

"5836","Given what I'm reading in this thread, I can see that it is definitely not abnormal. To some degree, everyone has the feelings we are discussing, but we feel it stronger or more frequently. 

I'm assuming you are a female. So you know that in a male-dominated field, you really are up against it. As a white guy, I haven't had to deal with this issue. But I've seen too many groups feel that way to argue that the feeling doesn't exist. It does. And that is unjust. Add this into the mix, and of course you are exhausted at the end of the day.

Do you see a therapist of some sort? I think a female therapist with ADHD experience would be able to really identify with what you deal with on a day-to-day basis.

"5875","I'll try not to be too overly-scientific in my descriptions, but I can do so if you'd like. 

Concerta XL has a 'weird' release-mechanism. IIRC it releases 22% of its Methylphenidate HCl immediately, with the other 78% being slowly used-up throughout the day. 

Concerta XL achieves this, because of its special 'wax'-coating. 

Therefore, digest the wax faster, you get more in your system, but it doesn't last as long, and vice versa. 

---

A number of factors change the speed at which you digest this wax , as well as the speed at which you metabolise its active ingredient, Methylphenidate Hydrochloride. 

These include your water-intake, your urine pH, and how much you're digesting on-top-of the Concerta. 

---

Water: 

The more you drink, the faster the wax will dissolve. Simple as. 

I *do not* condone dehydrating oneself in order to feel the effect longer!

Instead, I'd recommend drinking water systematically throughout the day. 

By this, I mean I'd recommend you drink, say, a small amount of water very often, in order to stay constantly-hydrated, yet at the same time, not dissolving the Concerta 'irratically' by 'downing' a litre of water every two hours, on the hour.

Thought-process being that a constant amount of water will dissolve the pill at a more constant, consistent rate, over a sporadic hydration-frenzy, at much more spaced-out intervals, which would 'drown' the pill, and weaken its effects. 

Also, please note how important it is to stay hydrated! You'll feel orders-of-magnitude-better throughout the day if you're always hydrated, and very up-and-down and sluggish if you're not. 

---

Urine pH:

Ascorbic Acid, A.K.A. Vitamin C, is digested in the same way as most stimulants, like Methylphenidate Hydrochloride, as well as the Amphetamine-class of drugs (think Adderall, Dexedrine, Evekeo, and, to a lesser extent, Vyvanse). 

Because of this, it's recommended to leave Vitamin C out of your diet as much as possible whilst taking stimulants, so your body doesn't prioritise one over the other. 

Your med's half-life will then increase because of the now more-basic pH of your stomach, and, thus, your urine. 

This is why some people will take an antacid before taking their meds - to lower your stomach pH. 

I'd recommend taking any Vitamin C-containing supplements at night, and not having things like orange juice with breakfast. 

---

Food-Intake:

Take your meds on an empty stomach (before breakfast). If you want to take an antacid, take that ~30mins before taking your meds, so the antacid can properly coat your stomach (and read the antacid label - you have to chew most of them). 

You're to take your meds before you eat, in order to let your body properly manage what you're putting in it. 

Eating beforehand will mean your body will be digesting food and not prioritising your meds. You don't want that. 

Eating at the same time will lead to similar results. 

Leaving a 'buffer' between taking your meds and eating, will let your body deal with your meds and let them 'kick-in' properly, so to speak, without being 'interrupted' by digesting food. 

---

Finally, I should probably mention supplementation. 

First-off, it is meant as *supplementation* to an already-balanced, and healthy, diet! No amount of supplementation will make up for a poor diet, especially on meds. **You need to have a good, well-rounded diet**. 

Now, once that's taken care of, there are a few things I'd recommend (all of which I take). These are: Magnesium, a Multivitamin, Fish Oil/Omega-3, and, if you need it, L-Arginine. 

---

Magnesium:

A very important piece of an ADHDer's diet, from my experience. 

There have been studies that conclude that people with ADHD may need more magnesium in their diet than normal, as our brain may simply use it faster, or use more of it. 

I won't go too in-depth, but magnesium is vital to many parts of the body, and the body's various processes. 

Magnesium supplementation also helps in the Calcium-Magnesium Channel in the brain, which, IIRC, is part of what can make you tolerant or addicted to something, like our meds, so more magnesium is supposed to help keep tolerance low, and potential addiction at a minimum (been a while since reading that study - a simple google search should back this up, tho). 

From experience, Magnesium also helps tremendously with comedowns and comedown headaches/migraines. 

---

Multivitamins:

Just to keep everything a-ok. Not a necessity, but as appetite decreases, I find some solace in knowing that I still have that little boost to my blood chemistry :)

If you decide to take a multivitamin, I'd recommend something like Centrum Advanced 50+. It has more of certain minerals when compared to standard Centrum Advanced, is basically the same price, and has low-ish levels of Vitamin C (lowest I've found in a multivitamin, which is what I want). I take it at night so that the Vitamin C doesn't mess with my meds. 

---

Fish Oils/Omega-3:

Helps with cognition. And brain health. Yay!

Omega-3 is the important part. Go for that over a generic Fish Oils mix of -3/-6/-9. My Pharmacist recommends brands with higher concentrations of EPA (which then usually means a higher amount of DHA). This is because these are what's best for cognition, etc. 

---

L-Arginine:

This is for Vasoconstriction. It's an amino-acid that's vital in the production of Nitric Oxide. This means you get your much-needed Vasodilation without the adverse effect of decreased Norepinephrine! Aw yeah!

I have a few (heavier, more in-depth) posts about it (and how it works), which you can easily find in my comment history. 

---

That's about it, OP.

But obviously if it's not a visible disability they won't know if you can meet those requirements because they won't know what the problem actually is without asking, and from that it doesn't sound like they can ask. So they won't know unless you tell them.  
  
I get what you're saying but obviously everyone's different and ADHD is a spectrum. I just wish everyone could be honest about everything really though, I wish everyone could just be treated fairly and not even have to think about potentially being discriminated against...  
  
[This article](http://www.xojane.com/issues/why-i-always-disclose-my-disability-in-a-job-interview) that someone with a physical disability wrote is interesting:  
  
&gt; Disclosing a disability on a job interview works much in the same way. Oftentimes, I find that able-bodied people tend to assume that a disability is this huge insurmountable obstacle that will prevent me from being able to do the job at hand.  
  
&gt; However, if I take charge and lead the conversation, it allows me to ease some of their fears. I can assure them that I am completely capable of doing the job.  
  
&gt; I guess my biggest piece of advice would be to stop treating your disability like it‚Äôs your most shameful secret that you can‚Äôt even bear to mention. Instead treat it like it‚Äôs no big deal. Because, like my dates, when you find the right employer, they‚Äôll know that it isn‚Äôt.","d7arckw",1,1473113572,"2016-09-05 22:12:52"

I got a BA and a MA, but each time it almost killed me. I felt like such shit having to go from GP to GP, ''hamming up' my depression, anxiety, insomnia etc. in order to obtain notes. It was a....frantic time.

Thinking I was just a lazy and disorganised oaf rattled my self-esteem for years. For years I felt kind of doomed/condemned/persecuted by the cosmos.

As for matters of employment, my ability to hit the minimum targets expected of someone on the payroll lost me countless menial jobs. I felt ashamed.

What I'll say is you absolutely can succeed at college. If I was on meds during school, and later university, I might enrolled somewhere more prestigious, or produced distinguished work.

I found that the lateral thinking skills that us ADHD folks apparently possess helped me no end. I figured out a way to do my assignments despite reading only 1/10th of the course material and almost never attending seminars; I  continued to develop a specific theoretical stance as I went, importing ideas  and continuing on the same thread semester to semester, uni to grad school.

I have tried writing down as and when I think of something between sessions (actually downloaded Evernote for that purpose).

But it sometimes feels like I am still unable to communicate with my therapist in a way that should be clear to her.

Its good to **have someone support** me to break things down, but it seems like people don't really understand my perspective of things. I think that has been the biggest challenge when getting someone's help. I have had friends tell me ""stop blaming your ADHD"".

And yes you are right, since my interviews aren't really far away I should not be spending time trying to figure out what kind of disorder is causing what. The reason I ended up doing that is because the anxiety actually crippled me from taking any steps to the extent of making it difficult to get up from my bed in the morning.

At this point with the anxiety I do feel really low on self confidence but hopefully I get better at this.

"5918","I made the honor roll in high school and skated through my associates degree - and when I say ""skated"" I mean there were classes on my transcript I didn't even remember taking.... I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until I was 26. Thanks to good grades, hyperfocus, and a whole heap of misconceptions, I didn't even consider it to be a possibility. 

**ADHD individuals are motivated by INCU...**

* Interest
* Novelty
* Challenge/Competition
* Urgency 

(I can only remember it as NICU...) 

Waiting until the deadline creates an effective ""urgency"" motivator. In order to get things done, we have to be creative about the ways we can make it ""novel"", ""challenging"" (like a bet, or a competition), or otherwise ""interesting"". Unlike neurotypicals, we can't ""Just do it"" and we can't do it ""because it should be done"". Our brains just aren't wired that way. 

I'm not good at doing things incrementally, because initiating tasks and transitioning between tasks is difficult for me. I'm better when I work for large chunks of time. But if your goal is just to avoid the procrastination, there are several ways you can approach it. 

It seems like **you're interested in lifting**, so maybe you can **hijack that motivator by studying just after exercising**. I know I feel good during and after a good run, so I'm more likely to be productive on uninteresting things in the hour or two afterwards. (Assuming I've eaten enough that day and don't immediately crash afterwards HA!) Or you can **try studying before and using the workout as a reward** but I doubt that will work because *ADHD people aren't motivated by rewards as much as neurotypicals*. 

**Make it an Event** - Schedule something fun or novel to enjoy during your work sessions. Like for me, it might be something like... ""I'm having a study session on Wednesday night! I'm going to put on my favorite pajamas, order pizza, drink a 2L pepsi, and watch Two Weeks Notice in the background! Yeah!"" That sort of makes it something to look forward to.

**Make it into a Game** - If you can find a way to make a game out of studying or doing assignments, it might be easier. Like if you're reading, maybe read and try to find words that start with ""r"" or something. 

**Use a Timer** - Instead of vaguely saying ""I need to work on school stuff... bleh...."" Try saying ""I'm going to work on X for X amount of time."" Make it small to start with. A lot of people I've encountered with ADHD have said if they can just START on something, it's easier to follow through. So if you can dedicate even 10 minutes to the task, you might find yourself getting in 20 or 30 at a time. **Schedule some breaks and use timers for those, too.** Try working, say, 20 minutes on-task, 10 minute break, for 2 hours or something. Whatever seems reasonable to you. **This doesn't help with INCU** but it does make the task more manageable. 

**Break it Down** - Break down each of your assignments into bite-sized chunks. Like whatever you can get done in 10-30 minutes. Then just do one at a time. **Also doesn't help with INCU** but it makes it more manageable. The goal is just to **keep it on the front burner**. Do a little as often as you can. Don't worry about specific scheduling, just keep it small and do-able. 

**Be Specific** - If you have to, write down all your assignment chunks on slips of paper and draw them out at random. Commit to whatever goal you've chosen.  

**My personal tip for writing papers** - Just write what comes to mind. Don't worry about outlines or format or anything like that to start with. Just write whatever you think and feel about the topic. Even if your first paragraph starts with ""Omg this is so stupid. I don't want to write a paper about _____"". *Just be careful when you edit it later. LOL* **This will help get the brain flowing.** 

YOU ARE NOT A NORMAL BRAIN. So don't try to be like all the neurotypical students. And give yourself a break. It's tough, but the more you beat yourself up for not doing things ""right"", the harder it will be to keep trying. Just praise yourself for the smallest successes. Mental high-fives for every time you crack open the books, even if you only stick with it for 5 minutes. 

**Know yourself!** Figure out what gets you in the zone and how you can integrate your assignments into those parameters. 

Hope ANY of that is helpful to you! Good luck! And hang in there!

"5922","Okay, yeah. You could use a coach. But I'm going to assume, like many people (including myself), you can't afford a coach due to financial constraints. 

So you need to critically look at yourself starting with your past: you *can* be a successful student, you just need a network of support around you to do so at the moment. But with the proper training and self-discipline, you could build the habits to become more autonomous, but you have to recognize the type of support you require to function before you can attempt to successfully manage yourself. 

I didn't do as well as you did in school, but I had my moments. The only reason I *got* through high school was because I had a tight network of friends and family members helping me along the way. Friends would tell me what this week's assignment was for whatever class we shared while my mom picked up after me: it was so much easier back then because it was. Suddenly they're gone and I'm stuck standing in my kitchen for twenty minutes wondering where the fuck I put the scissors this time. 

I've also realized that my best friend was a definite keeper. Having ADHD adds a certain emotional volatility to my demeanor, and she was always there to listen to me vent. Her doing that acted as a sort of filter for me in regards to other friendships; I was a nicer, more understanding person in general because I could vent to her constantly. This is not something that's easy to do - listen to people vent - you've got to really love someone to put up with that shit. 

She was one of the few people in my life who had a very intuitive understanding of my ADHD from watching me...live. She covered for my weak spots and I pulled all the crazy stunts she wanted to pull.. She acted as a secretary for me at times. Not because she was inferior to me in any way - not at all - but because she knew I'd lose those fucking papers so she held onto them because she loved me. 

I miss her all the time. 

Anyway, if I was rich I'd hire a coach and a secretary and boom: 85% of my problems solved (I am pulling that number out of my ass, but I do feel that it could very well be true if we were able to measure such a thing). But I can't. So I have to develop some system that performs the tasks an ADHD coach and office assistant would perform. I think about ways to answer that need of mine. 

As ADHD people, we need to develop personal systems for ourselves to better manage our minds. We need to tame our unruly, stallion brains. 

It has taken me years to master having a functional office and being able to find and understand paperwork, but I've done it, and now - in a very lame turn on events - I'm starting to oddly enjoy it. 

I make *several schedules with different time frames* to better visualize the immediate future and keep track of future appointments, family events, and professional milestones. I update my wall calendars, my ""meta"" calendars, and my daily planner every few days. 

I am very scrupulous about having things in their proper place around the house. I don't want to be this anal retentive about it, but I'd rather do that and find the fucking Phillips each and every time rather than dither around looking for it god knows where yet again. 

I'm trying to reintegrate art, yoga, and meditation back into my life. I wasn't very serious about any of them in high school, but they really help me siphon out the crazy in a far healthier fashion than drugs and alcohol. The dopamine rush isnt as quick, but it's there and it doesn't fade away or plateau out. 

I'm trying to be more emotionally aware of myself - which is for some reason incredibly difficult at times. But I am better at feeling when and where I am anxious and what exactly makes me anxious. The things that make me anxious are not what make other people anxious, and I think that unfamiliarity is a big reason why I chose not to see it in the past. 

I hope my rambling sort of helped. Good luck either way! Listen to yourself and trust your instincts! Only you know the madness in your head!

"5925","Can't exactly explain it that simply but I'll try and explain it a little more in depth. Obsessive thoughts is OCD without compulsions. OCD is an anxiety disorder that derives from anxious obsessions and often generates compulsions. The compulsions are what OCD is most known for, such as washing hands constantly for hours at a time. Compulsions are the things that ease the anxious obsessions. OCD can, however, be purely obsession based without the compulsions which would essentially be rumination but it can get far worse than just rumination. It can result in high levels of irritability, constant complaining, internet searches full of the subject of whatever is being obsessed over, and so forth. I'd consider these more rational compulsions than hand washing but that's debatable (still, I've learned a shit ton as a result of my anxiety) and they can still be debilitating. My obsessions are more mild, personally, and only usually a result of a lot of different stressors coming together. Therapy helped me understand the multi dynamic sources of my anxiety which helps me avoid misdirecting it towards any one thing in some irrational way. It just so happens that a lot of my anxiety is derived from my inability to block out extraneous stimuli from my environment which is very typical of people with ADHD. Believe it derives from vestibular impairments but I'm not entirely sure. Fortunately, Guanfacine treats this problem to a degree and also helps with my sensitivity/reactivity in general when paired with a stimulant so I haven't had much trouble with ruminations and other obsessive based thoughts of late. Most ADHDers don't need to seek an alternative diagnosis for this line of treatment since guanfacine ER/Intuniv is an ADHD medication, just need to have a cooperative relationship with their psychiatrist and be open to whatever suggestions the psychiatrist might initially make.

**TLDR** Obsessive thoughts is OCD without compulsions (like hand washing or checking). SSRIs/antidepressants are first line of treatment for anxiety disorders. Occassionally don't work. Guanfacine is also an option for anxiety but also an option for people with ADHD.","e2cn66g",3,1531527320,"2018-07-14 00:15:20"

It takes way more time for ADHD people to transfer information from the back of the brain to the frontal lobe where everything is put into perspective. This is also a reason why many central ADHD traits are seen as being immature, since they often relate to what neurotypical people see as issues attributed to a child.

Medication changed my life completely.
Meditation twice a day for at least half an hour and talking to a professional once every two months is what works for me. Meds can rarely work on its own. However, it is different for everyone.

"5938","Somebody did a post with bold on the important parts and it was awesome so I'm doing that.

In general: **I say no brain, I'm not doing this.** Every time I start feeling bad, I think about something else, like what's around me. I do something to distract myself, like play Freecell on my phone because that keeps my brain occupied until I drop my phone on my face (when I'm trying to go to sleep), at which point I can usually put it down and pass out.

Specific to not having gotten things done: **I go do something.** Doesn't matter how late it is, I'm going to go put a dish in the dishwasher. Doesn't matter how small, I go do something productive and tell the self-recrimination to stuff it. Fuck you, brain, I did something, I beat you. STFU.

Then, the next day, I require myself to do another tiny thing. And I tell the self-recrimination to stuff it, because I did a thing, and that's going to be enough goddammit.

**Because if I do one thing,** no matter how small, then **a lot of the time I can do another thing.** But if I think about how much I have to do, I can't do anything.

I put my blinders on, pretend that the only thing in the world is that one dish, and I put it where it goes.

I hate feeling shitty about myself, so I go do something to fix the problem, whatever I can do right now. And I remind myself that **every step I take is one more step behind me.** I only stand still if I don't step; if I don't step, I stand still. And where I'm standing feels shitty, **I don't want to be here, so I will take that step.**

Sometimes the step is to stay up and finish the dishes. Sometimes the step is to put away one dish and then go to bed so that I can have more willpower (and less anxiety) tomorrow.","ejwfik0",3,1554151547,"2019-04-01 20:45:47"

And that's a fucking ignorant comment about treating a 37 year old for ADD... but you already knew that.

So here's my suggestion and if you follow it, you should be able to find yourself a good doctor.

Get a map of your surrounding area.

Then start googling family physician and the street name and city name of where you want their office to be.

Get yourself a nice list going and start cold calling all the GPs on your list.  Tell them you have ADHD and you want a doctor that has had at least 10 years experience treating this disorder.

If you are persistent, you will have a 100% success rate.  If you give up then you only have yourself to blame.

Good luck!

Edit.

Oh yeah, before you make that first visit with the new doctor, PLEASE do yourself a favor and chronicle what you've taken and how often you taken it.

"5944","Well said! just going to add a point or two of my own:


* A lack of patience and not being able to stay still for more than a few minutes will utterly fuck you over as a hunter (remember, spears were the first weapons used and they are used in close quarters, not from fifty feet away. Even an atlatl or bow needs 20-30 feet distance for best results) . And in a stone age society, an unsuccessful hunter didnt stay a hunter for very long. They either did something else they were good at or they wound up getting killed through impatience.


* There was some rigidity to social structure. If you kept stepping out of line and did nothing to correct your behaviour, you could be expelled from the tribe (which would eventually kill you) or even killed outright. (this is an expansion on the ""insulting the chief"" comment.) They had unspoken social rules like we do and how many of us here has stepped on toes and just couldnt seem to stop, no matter how hard we tried? ","ck47fid",4,1409354820,"2014-08-29 23:27:00"

So eh, about the wellbutrin, apparently I'm unable to read; the text clearly stated it wasn't an SSRI. Go me!  
  
Still, my point about imipramine remains valid, it seems to play nice with dex. But I'm speaking from my own experience with the stuff, and I only use it so that I can fall asleep like somebody who isn't completely wired/stimmed up. Also, it makes me *not* a complete arse in the morning before taking meds, so that's nice. But I'm not taking it for depression, so my dosage is a lot lower than the ones used for treating depression. Make of that what you will. In any case, your neurologist probably knows **a lot** more about that kind of stuff than I do, so they may say something completely different about taking TCAs or imipramine specifically. (And they're probably right.)
  
So, stimulants work pretty much instantly (since that's their modus operandi), but for a short duration. This is best visible in cocaine-like substances like cocaine (duh) and methylphenidate, which have an exceedingly short half-life of respectively 1 hour and 2 hours.   
Dextro-amphetamine though... not so much. It has a half-life of somewhere between 10 and 12 hours, meaning that you're constantly increasing the concentration of meds in your blood -- or at least up to the point where the first dose has completely left your body. That's why it takes a few days to adjust to it, unlike methylphenidate where stable blood levels are achieved a lot quicker.  
  
And yes, I think I know what kind of tension you mean. Feels like it pulsates and swirls/spins a bit on the outside, right? I believe that's [vertigo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo), or *draaiduizeligheid*. You get that one in the free mandatory side-effects bonus pack for dex as well, woohoo! Nothing you can do about it though, except lowering your dosage, if at all possible. It's usually a sign that you've taken *quite enough* of the meds. But yeah, it blows. Hard.  
  
During your 'test run', as it were, tomorrow try to check things like how you're feeling, if you feel disconnected from the world or the opposite, heart rate, concentration, etc. You'll most likely notice that the ...less subtle effects (both positive and negative) will taper off starting around T+5:00h. Might be faster for you though, for example I'm on one pill (5mg) every 4 hours. Just try to remember as much as you can (write it down!), this will help your neurologist as well. More info = better.  
  
Glad you're thinking responsibly about the meds, and finally having a competent physician will help as well I imagine!  
  
If you have any questions whatsoever, don't hesitate to ask! I'm glad to help. c: En in ieder geval alvast succes toegewenst voor morgen!","cg4bjet",1,1395012664,"2014-03-16 23:31:04"

"5953","As the other person said, I don't think most of this is neurotypical behaviour. A lot of ADHDers also show these same behaviours. I'm assuming most of it is exaggerated like you mentioned, but I'll comment on a few of the big ones:

The average person isn't all that tidy or orderly. Somebody being obsessively clean and organized is *not* normal. And ADHDers can be these things, too (source: me). It's not fun.

Being afraid of something that has a tiny chance of happening isn't neurotypical or ADHD behaviour - that's anxiety. Being overly stressed about embarrassment is also anxiety. This is commonly experienced by ADHDers and neurotypical people alike, though.

Repeating the same words and stories is often an ADHD trait, too.

This does seem rude to bring up, but I only do it because of your comment about envy... are you sure most of these things don't come down to envy?

They're meant to be used to figure out if it's worth pursuing a full diagnosis or not. If you ""passed"" them, then you should go and talk to a doctor about being diagnosed, as it's likely (but not certain) that you have the condition. I also wouldn't put too much stock in what your brother says. Everyone presents differently. Some are primarily hyperactive, some are primarily inattentive, some are both. And even within those groups no two people present exactly the same, the condition is one of a lack of dopamine in the brain, and how your brain tries to cope with that can be from any large number of options. Again, a doctor would be able to help there.

BUT, even if you do go to a doctor and they the result is that you don't have ADHD, that doesn't change a lot other than whether or not certain medications (namely stimulants) are going to be available to you. But all the other treatments still exist, and can still be valuable. These include some medicines like Bupropion, which is both an anti-depressant but also sometimes used for ADHD symptoms. It also includes things like therapy and all the various coping mechanisms developed by countless ADHDers.

No clue about the interactions. But...I would hope that the doctor prescribing you medication for your mental health would know if there were severe drug interactions with what you are on. If there is a moderate interaction marked online when you looked them up, then your doctor has probably decided that the benefits out weigh the moderate interactions.

But, it is worth noting that the various adhd meds affect people differently. So if this one is making you feel weird, trying a different one might be worth asking about. Only you can really determine if the benefits outweigh some of the side effects. I can always tell when my meds start working... I've tried 3 types now. Ritalin put me to sleep.

You can do this, you have managed to teach him so much in his short life already.  
I get your frustration and I feel for you.  Right now you are in a unique position and have a great opportunity to really bond with your son and have some special memories even the ones where you wanted to rip your hair out. 

Personally I hate math, so I get this frustration on both parts.
Do you have to teach subjects by a particular schedule?  Does your son do better in the morning, afternoon, late afternoon?  Can you break his math up in smaller sections and sandwich in between work he is good with, fun tasks, small breaks? 

 Can you make it a special occurrence?  I might sound stupid but maybe build a fort or make really cool space he would like where math is done, have music on low, pop popcorn or some kind of snack and surround math with pleasant things. 
Get the anxiety with math low,everyone relaxed and take some if the pressure off.  Or try doing some jumping jacks and movements before hand and during to shake off the stress of you both. Shake the sillies and stress out.  Meditate or just do some pre-math deep breathing relaxation and maybe again during math of it gets stressful.  



Does he respond to reward systems like stickers or tokens that add up to a bigger reward later in the week?  It could be baking something,  picking a movie, going to the library,  riding bikes, trip to the dollar store with one whole dollar. Buy a lego set and every correct answer or page earns him lego pieces you together build one by one. Or any toy that comes with accessories like a Mr. Potato Head or whatever kids are into nows a days.
Make certificates for most improved or student of the week, penmanship, little encouragement. 
Can you break down the math even more and focus on the parts he doesn't get? Applaud and encourage the things he does do correctly and just keep telling him it's ok he will get it eventually. 

What is his learning style or combo of style that he does best? Auditory,kinetics, visual, reading/writing?  How could you incorporate that into how he is learning math?  How does he think?
  I had one kid who is very artistic so when she was little coloring and art was used heavily in things she hated.
 Can you create it into a game? A board game or physical movement game, flash cards,  bingo, write out problems with sidewalk chalk and you write the answers and other random answers and he has to bean bag toss to the right answer or he jumps to the answer like hop scotch if you want to be more physical.  It can be stupid things like blowing up a balloon and having solo cups lined up and he gets to knock those down with the air from the balloon when he gets it right. 
Have him try and teach you what he knows and then the rest of what he doesn't. 
If he is a tactile kind of kid let him fidget absentmindedly with a slinky or play dough while you instruct.

I used to tell my kids that sometimes it just takes us a little bit longer and a little more extra to finally learn something and no time at all for other things.
I'd remind them.of things they learned in the past and things they had a hard time at first and eventually got. Even a story of your own where something was difficult and after time you learned. It helped take some of the pressure off when they knew it would click for them eventually and wouldn't be stuck not knowing a certain subject or material forever.  I would just say  relax your mind.  My own mind gets like grid lock sometimes, so calm helps. 



Also maybe look online for math video games and mathbooks that are laid out as stories.  There even online learning for his grade that is presented as fun. Incorporate that into his learning and it might help because it is less of task and will get his mind relaxed about math or other topics. I did a Google search and abcmouse was one of the first that popped up. My kids played a math game that wasn't numbers math called Zoombinis it was a deduction and reasoning game.  Made math not so horrible for them.  They hated math too.  

If your homeschooling isn't ridgid and set up by the school on a schedule take advantage of it being more fluid and organic at home.  If he doesn't have to be at a desk or table and you can be on the floor with pillows or outside on the patio, at a cafe,park or the library,  just to switch it up every now and then and make it appeal as something to look forward to.
And if you still can't do it together recruit family, friend,  neighbors to help you tackle that subject
Just give lots of encouraging feedback it helps.

"5990","Two points here.

1) You aren't hiding anything from him by saying it's the server client. If he has 20 employees and only one is blaming underperformance on a server client... he's got a brain. He knows you're feeding him a line. Would you rather your boss think you're intentionally misleading him to cover laziness, or think that you're an employee that *wants to succeed more than anything*, but needs some management to do so? He's a manager his whole *job* is to maximize his team's productivity.

2) That's illegal. If you have a mental illness or disability you're required to be offered reasonable accommodations. 

Honestly, having a team of employees that *want to succeed* is so much more important than you're giving it credit for, and the cost of replacing an employee is much, much higher than you seem to think it is. I think the estimate is that the company burns around half a year's salary every time they replace a position. For example, if they drop a guy making $40k because they don't like him, they're going to *spend* $20k on replacing him... and they still have to pay the replacement $40k, too.

My story isn't fiction. Do you need a good manager? Yeah, probably. Is that worth looking for? I think so. I don't think I'll ever work for a boss that I can't have that kind of relationship with again. I can only speak from my experience, but if you're willing to put out, there are people willing to work with you.

I also want to reiterate-- you're not asking him to manage your disability for you. You're coming up with plans and tools that you can implement, but you want his oversight on. That's *way* different from saying ""Hey, I didn't get any work done today because of cat pictures. Can you help me?"" You're presenting a solution, not a problem. Your angle is that you're taking the initiative on taking *good* performance and making it *great*, not that you're hanging on for dear life and need your boss to check your homework and make you breakfast or something.","d7z4r3t",2,1474652739,"2016-09-23 17:45:39"

"5998","First it is not just dopamine, norepinephrine also is involved.  Second the brain and the cell structure itself also affects ADHD.

Oh whatever, I won't write it all out, I will instead link it.

&gt;Traditionally, neurobiological research on ADHD has focused on catecholaminergic pathways, the main target of pharmacological treatments. However, more distal and basic neuronal processes in relation with cell architecture and function might also play a role, possibly accounting for the coexistence of both diffuse and specific alterations of brain structure and activation patterns. This article aims to provide an overview of recent findings in the rapidly evolving field of ADHD neurobiology with a focus on novel strategies regarding pathophysiological analyses.

[Neurobiology of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, a meta explanation of the advances in the last decades](http://www.nature.com/pr/journal/v69/n5-2/full/pr9201196a.html)

If you merely said dopamine is a significant factor I would agree with you, but saying words like core dysfunction is like saying if you have an engine you have a car.  No the engine is important to the car, but there are numerous other parts you need (such as wheels) before you get a car.  ADHD is not just dopamine, dopamine and norepinephrine based drugs are the main way we treat it, but there is so much more involved here than just dopamine and norepinephrine.  Many people have gene variants that are tied to ADHD but are not ADHD for example the 10-repeat version of DAT1.","cl1mx8t",1,1412569513,"2014-10-06 04:25:13"
"5999","Context: I grew up in an abusive household. My father was obsessed with the idea that my brothers and I were lying to him. And if he thought we were lying, punishment would be swift and far more than merited.

I have a hard time remembering important details. I have a hard time conveying information and ideas concisely and clearly. If asked a question and I answered it truthfully, more often than not I wouldn't be believed anyways and get punished. So I learned pretty young that the best course of action was almost always to just lie whenever anyone and me anything. As long as the lie was what they wanted to hear, they would believe it more often than not.

That translated quite easily into lying about how much work I had done. Saying I finished assignments when I hadn't, then scrambling to finish then before they were checked, or coming up with a reason why I couldn't turn it in at all. 

I'm my adult life, I still do it more than I want to, despite being in a situation where it really isn't needed. Force of habit. And almost never about important things. ""Do we have milk?"" ""Yes, at least half a gallon left"" I emptied the jug this morning. She won't care that we are out of milk. It doesn't matter. Why do I have to lie about something like that?

 But more often, it's exaggeration that gets me. If I make an $80 sale work, that becomes $100 because that sounds better. I round every number up because I need to be useful and pulling my weight and the truth never feels like it was enough. Or I assume people already think I'm exaggerating so if I tell the truth they'll round that number down to correct.

Your employer doesn't tell you they *can't* accommodate you, but that they *won't* accommodate you.

This idea is so fundamentally flawed that it's not even worth addressing, only shaking my head in frustration at the basic lack of understanding about *degree* of disability and uniqueness of cases.

Morbid (sick / unhealthy) might be the important word here. Even if you look at it from a scientific standpoint you basically say homosexuality is an abnormality. As you say homosexual activity is seen in a wide variety of species and the question is: is it that abnormal? Homosexuality as a mental disorder was removed from the [DSM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) in 1980 or so.   

Looking at humans it might be almost only social and cultural factors on how homosexuality is 'allowed' in society and thus people coming out or not.

"6054","I got diagnosed with ADHD a couple months ago and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 5 years ago. I am currently working on getting my psychiatrist to believe me when I say I don't have bipolar disorder but rather it has been ADHD this entire time. I just saw her today for the first time since having this realization. She doesn't believe me so she won't up my vyvanse like I think I need. She is helping me wean off the lamotrigine despite her reluctance. 

I basically have had depression multiple times in my life because of situational things. It has never come out of nowhere, which is what happens with bipolar disorder. When I'm depressed I sleep a lot and don't want to do anything or be social. When I'm not depressed I talk quickly, am impulsive, and have racing thoughts. That does not come for a period of time and then stop leaving me in a normal state. It is literally always like that unless I'm depressed. In bipolar disorder those behaviors come out of nowhere and last for a period of time to then subside so you're in a normal state for a bit. I have also never been extremely productive unless I had an absurd time pressure from extreme procrastination. I have also never been able to not sleep for a period of time and not feel tired. So I do not think I have ever experienced mania. I have friends with bipolar disorder and when they describe their mania, I do not relate at all. 

She thinks that I am in a hypomanic state right now because I sent her a long, rambling message last week about how the Modafinil I switched to from adderall was not working, how I've come to realize that I 100% do have ADHD, and that I believe I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder. She said the message was hard to follow. But I literally have always sent long, rambling messages except for when I was on adderall. I was freaking out and am still freaking out about this realization. I did a lot of research and printed off studies &amp; DSM-V criteria for BPD and ADHD while marking the ones I do and don't identify with. She said that seems manic. The fact I was so upset at my appointment today also concerns her. 

*sigh* I hyperfocus on things when I'm anxious about them. I am upset because I was misdiagnosed for these past 5 years instead of having my actual problem addressed. I sent a long, rambling messages because I have ADHD so I hyperfocus and have racing thoughts especially when anxious. 

She said she may up my vyvanse in a few weeks depending on how I do on the 20 mg/day and how I do with reducing the lamotrigine. She's worried I'll become manic and get picked up by the police if she increases me on a stimulant. I have literally never in my entire life been manic like that. Hell I've never experienced mania. I just confused ADHD symptoms with mania. My first psychiatrist didn't do a proper evaluation of me. She never considered ADHD even when I brought it up to her. It sucks that now I need to spend months getting off of lamotrigine and convincing ny new psychiatrist that I am not bipolar so she can remove that as a medical diagnosis on my medical record.

You know yourself best. Do not accept that diagnosis if you do not feel like it is correct. Find a different psychiatrist to get a second opinion. Advocate for yourself. ","dx7pq4a",2,1523490026,"2018-04-11 23:40:26"

"6057","I have been on several meds since being diagnosed with ADHD in 2014.  *I am an unusual case which is not the norm.*  Most ADHD people do fine on the first med try (50 to 66% success rate depending on whether it is a stimulant or non stimulant).  This number goes up to 80% once you try both stimulants, and 90% once you try all ADHD meds (there are over a half a dozen different type of ADHD meds that all effect neurotransmitters but how they do it is different).  Failure is either little to no improvement or side effects that are not worth the benefits.

-----

* Cymbalta-Put on this prior to being diagnosed ADHD.  Helped me focus a little better and helped with depression, anxiety, and sensory issues.

* Strattera-Saw some improvement after the initial weaning on the med (it is all side effects for the first 3 to 6 weeks) saw some improvement but when we up my dosage I felt restless and kinda manac and saw no improvement.  We also went off this med for a side effect that made another condition I have worse that is unrelated to ADHD.

* Wellbutrin-No downsides but did not help enough.  I consider this a great med but not enough for me.

* Vyvanse-Helped the ability to focus a lot, but it caused really bad anxiety when we went up with the dose.  On the higher doses I had a decrease in working memory but still could focus well (plus I was very anxious).

* Intuniv-A nonstimulant ADHD med that only treats some ADHD symptoms but it is also an blood pressure lowering med and anxiety reducing med.  Awesome med in my mind.

In the end after several months of figuring it out we settled on a combination of meds.  In all situations I saw improvements and each time we tried a new med it was always better than the time before meds.  **I am an atypical case, the reason we had to try so many meds was due to my comorbidities making things difficult.**  Even in my case I was happy throughout the entire time for life was better and easier.

"6074","Also, I wanted to say that shops suck in part because ADHD makes it really hard to filter out all the stimulation.  If I go to the mall during the Christmas rush while ON meds, I can filter out the noises (people talking, registers beeping, louspeaker rambling) and the sights (lots of people, shiny shiny items to buy, and lights [dear Lord, I still hate lights, even on my meds!) and everything else (smells, people touching you, the fact that you are hot, the fact that you might be hungry or tired) Alllll that crap is a whole lot easier to filter/ignore when I am on my meds.  Kind of like a sieve, filtering out the big chunks of unimportant crap, so I can pay attention to only the stuff that matters.

Off my meds....it's all a barrage.  Imagine trying to juggle 3 balls, a knife, and a duck; while standing on one leg, whistling ""Oh Holy Night"", and answering a barrage of questions from 6 people at once.  Meds get rid of everything but the balls, the duck, and whistling.  When I can't filter out all the extra crap that is coming at my brain, I get frustrated and overwhelmed and SO EXHAUSTED.

Throwing up triggers severe panic attacks and it seems to have a high chance of causing severe nausea or throwing up. That, in addition of seemingly over half of the reviews for it being negative.... I might consider if it nothing else works though...

My main, most severe problem is that I can't initiate tasks, in addition to not being able to finish them. I want to, I know the benefits, but I can't actually start. Even with enjoyable things, like games.  Especially tasks with no end-goal, and that includes a job. If it has an end, like a school paper for example, I typically can get myself to start when the end is very near, when the panic sets in. 

I have tried sports, jogging is great, but it doesn't alleviate my problem at all, and in addition, once I lose interest even a little, I can't get myself to start it again. I've done jogging daily and after the first two weeks, I couldn't get myself to keep going. Same with weight lifting or actual workouts (including cardio). It never alleviated my problems either, I've still been unable to stick to doing things, finish them, or even start them.

"6092","For me, I have dealt with chronic fatigue for 10+ years.  It has only recently become clear that I have inattentive ADHD, and the constant struggle of trying to concentrate in school/on a specific task coupled with a tendency toward sensory overload (aka very sensitive/not good at filtering stimuli) leaves me mentally exhausted quite often. 

For me, here are some of the most important things:

1) sleep hygene:  Go to bed/ wake up at the SAME TIME EVERY DAY.

2) get plenty of sleep.  Make sure you get the rest you need. 8hrs/day average?  That's only an average, and many like myself require a lot more (9-10 is optimal for me, some need a little more).

3) exercise.  Go exercise and make it a routine.  Put it in the part of the day where you get sleepy/ near that time.  It really improves your energy level.

4) Caffeine? Stay away from it.  It has never worked for me, and caused similar symptoms.  Instead, take short breaks from whatever you are doing, rest with eyes closed, and/or meditate (aka chill out without focusing on any particular thing).

I can give a lot more specifics if you care to hear more, but these 4 things have saved my sanity over the past 10 years, and got me through a college degree.  I always wondered about my fatigue, and am finally figuring out how much all of this has affected my life.","ccv4zm1",4,1382212092,"2013-10-19 19:48:12"

I am forced to eat mostly highly nutritious/low-calorie foods. Basically, since I am not flexible, don't have a ""cheat day"", etc, the complete structure works for me.

"6095","It looks like severe anxiety to me, yes. And a doctor would probably suggest medication (It can help, I know people who has gone through the treatment - Most people get well again), however I myself decided not to take medication and struggle with my way to a healthy life instead.

Here is what I've learned from that:

* I had to stop making everything into a problem. The way I did this was to view everything as a challenge and to stop using the word problem all-together. That helped A LOT as it made me refuse to believe that no challenge couldn't be solved. However, you will also have to accept that the solution to your challenges might not be immediately available and they might not be what you expect, and in a lot of cases the solution is simply time.
* I learned to not give a flying shit about people I don't know well / don't like. I do however care, but not in an unhealthy manner, about the people I like. My point is: You should choose who you care for, and then ignore everyone else, but still be open to forming new relationships and finding new people to care about.
* I learned that even though I was probably going to rid myself of anxiety due to my young age, my mom who had struggled with anxiety her whole life and was at that time 55 years old, would probably never get rid of it. This one was really a hard one, but it wasn't until I dared to think that though that I was able to start helping her, and even though she freaks out by the smallest thing, her life is definitely better now that she doesn't have to worry so much about me no more.
* I realized that I love every living being, even the seemingly evil ones. Why? Well, because every bad action has a source and if we were to trace the blame back to its origins, we would probably find that no one can really be blamed for anything. We live in a fucked up world, and the truth is that people like you and me, who have been forced to deal with anxiety for many years, are uniquely equipped to make the best out of this world for ourselves and the people we love.
* I learned that humans can have what appears to be conflicting ideas and opinions without that being a bad thing. In fact, it is because most of us to some degree think that its a bad thing that we experience negative effects from it. For instance; I don't give a shit about most people, but I still love all beings. How can that be the case? Well, if you don't question it too much, it can be the case.
* I learned to vibrate with the people around me. Meaning, I consciously try to match my state of emotion and my demeanor with that of the people around me.
* I learned that feeling the physiological effects of fear, is not the same as being scared. Being scared is a mental decision, feeling it is not. You can feel fear without being mentally scared (Excitement for instance - Or by having full control in an adrenaline-fueled crisis), and you can be scared (Or know you are scared) without feeling the physiological effects of fear.
* At the basis of anxiety is always fear, and if you are able to remove fear you will see the mental structures of what anxiety is fall before your eyes. Literally. I walked around experiencing situations where I realized ""In this situation I would act because of fear and anxiety, but I don't feel it now and therefore I have no clue how to act now"". Experiencing this, I realized I had to learn how to act without fear and anxiety, as I had never done so previously. Also, I achieved this by taking control over an intense panic attack. I was freaking out, and decided to challenge my fear by imagining every single situation which scared me from that day and all the way back to my childhood. I got more and more scared by every memory I went through, my heart raced so fast I thought I was going to die but then I had a though ""Why am I still scared of this? Why am I even scared at all? Fear is a meaningless feeling"". After that I've never really been mentally scared, though I have felt fear on several occasions and owned it by fixing whatever made me feel scared.

By learning all of this, I now have the mental and emotional state needed to give me full access to my toolbox: Meaning, my intellect. I'm no longer motivated by fear, as the scared animal I was. I am now exclusively motivated by either emotion or well-rationalized modus operandi. I am willing to play dirty, manipulate and do almost anything as long as it is justified by helping someone, or even myself if I don't fuck someone over by doing so. Remember, parents have manipulated their kids since the dawn of time and why should they have any more right than you to do so?

"6103","This got really long! Oops. But I also had a really hard time seeing how my ADHD might have manifested in childhood until after my diagnosis, so I think these examples could be helpful. Fwiw, I also thought I had inattentive type but was ultimately diagnosed with ADHD-C. An important thing I didn't realize is that hyperactivity doesn't always mean being unable to stay in your seat or running around all the time; it is often directed inward in women and girls, and even directed outward it might not look like hyperactivity.

Anyway, here are all the childhood symptoms I can think of at the moment. Paragraph breaks are just for ease of reading; this is basically just a giant list.


I daydreamed a lot and was constantly staring off into space or out the window. My parents had to watch me at youth orchestra because I kept blurting things out in the middle of rehearsals. I was constantly running into things (and was generally a bit accident-prone) because I wasn't paying enough attention to my surroundings. I left drawers and cupboards open in the kitchen. 

My room was always a total mess, and any time I attempted to clean it I got distracted by things I found in my room so it took FOREVER - if it got done at all. I forgot to complete tasks all the time; when my mom asked me why I hadn't done something, my response was usually ""I forgot."" My locker and backpack were always cluttered and kind of gross. I lost completed assignments.

I had trouble making friends and was very shy, but when I got comfortable with someone I talked constantly. I would sometimes annoy my friends by repeatedly exclaiming, ""I'm hyper!"" I was extremely sensitive and cried a lot. I also tended to bottle up my anger until it exploded in outbursts that were frequently disproportionate to the situation. Otherwise, I was an absolute people-pleaser and often a teacher's pet in elementary school. 

Starting in high school (I think because I had less supervision by my parents at that point), I often did my homework right before class. I had terrible organizational skills in general. I could read for hours and hours, but frequently couldn't bring myself to do the reading for my classes. I fidgeted a lot. I couldn't (and still can't) sit properly in a chair for very long; I was always shifting positions so I could sit on one foot, then another, then sit cross-legged, etc. I constantly broke pens and pencils because I was playing with them while listening to the teacher speak.","gocy13h",3,1614014180,"2021-02-22 17:16:20"

**It is important to keep taking your prescription until your follow up unless you get any REALLY bad side effects Send an email to your psychiatrist/doctor about the side effects you're getting if you have questions for them. And if you get any of the horribly, life threatening ones listed in the little booklet that comes with your prescription, follow your common sense, stop taking them if you are afraid they'll worsen, and see a doctor ASAP.** 

If you still feel that the bad outweighs the good by the time of your appointment, talk to your doc, tell them that you might want to try something different and give them detail why.

by the way, over the next week if you feel up to it, keep a text log of side effects and feelings across the day. I always used to forget all the things I was going to ask my psychiatrist.

None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily.

"6151","I'm 45 and I've been on adderall for just over a year now, so I make before and after comparisons a lot. It's probably easier to see the impact of a drug like this when you have a long history without it. For the record, I was not diagnosed with any co-morbid disorders (depression or anxiety, or anything else).

From what I understand, adderall increases dopamine where we need it, but also dampens our emotions. 

When I first noticed that effect, I thought it was related to executive function, and I assumed that it was helping me to control my emotions better rather than blunting them. I found myself in a situation that, before adderall, would have felt like a physical blow to the gut, but this time it was just a shitty thing I could observe and recognize without feeling like I needed to double over. The physicality of those difficult emotions seemed to be gone. I thought that it was me controlling my reactions in the moment, but it's not. From what I understand, it's actually adderall slicing my emotions down. 

The only times I've been aware of this emotional blunting, it's been in relation to negative emotions and stress. But I presume if it's also blunting positive emotions. I can't say I've experienced it that way, but I wonder about it. 

For me, it was big learning to see that my emotional landscape is constructed cumulatively; it takes a while for big, unmanageable feelings to build up. While adderall is basically an on/off switch in many ways, the emotional effect seems to increase over time, in way, as you stop laying down brick after brick of big, gross, physically painful emotions that stick around.  I find it useful to know that and think of my emotional life more holistically. 

On the downside, I'm not completely sure this blunting is an actual reduction in my emotions, or whether it's just blunting my immediate experience of them. I don't know whether I still have those extended emotions lurking below my ability to recognize them. 

I have found myself reacting to stress I'm not aware that I'm feeling. Only in retrospect do I recognize that I was struggling emotionally, because in the moment I didn't really feel the crisis. It might just be that the emotional blunting means we need to re-learn our own danger signs and cues; adderall completely rebuilds your emotional world, in my experience. 

What has certainly happened is that I've pushed myself well beyond my own breaking point without realizing it, because the level of emotion I was feeling still seem tough, but still pretty manageable, comparatively. As long as I'm not feeling physical pain from the stress and negative emotions, I thought I was fine. But I'm just never going to feel it that way again, so that wasn't a good way to judge. Without adderall, I think I might have caught the signs that I was struggling sooner. Pretty much everything seems manageable on adderall, but that doesn't mean it necessarily is.

In sum, yeah, there's a very definite emotional reduction with adderall, but don't do what I did: don't stop being kind to yourself, and avoid using the advantage of less emotional reaction to push yourself further than you can normally go.","f7p2jes",1,1573940496,"2019-11-16 21:41:36"
"6152","Having talked with a therapist about exactly this, it can stem from the tendency toward addiction that a lot of people with ADHD have. Sex/masturbation releases endorphins and (in most cases) lots of them. Just like video games, drugs, good food, shopping (For some of us), or gambling, you're getting the rush of endorphins and dopamine and, because nothing else compares to that rush, it is like (or can become) an unhealthy obsession. \*to be clear sex addiction is still a controversial subject (despite being introduced in the late 90's) but studies show that activities that create that dopamine rush reliably or even semi-reliably can become addictive.","gw7og8m",1,1619640494,"2021-04-28 20:08:14"

"6161","Yes many vitamin bs subtypes are energy sources.  For example many energy drinks add vitamin b6, and to a lesser extent vitamin b3 and b12.  Energy drinks also have caffeine (a stimulant), and taurine.

Taurine is an amino acid so it has many purposes.  It effects your cardiovascular system but it also effects where the ""salts""/""minerals are inside your cell and outside your cells.  Taurine is sometimes an anti-anxiety supplement, for if your potassium, magnesium, sodium, etc is out of whack you will be more anxious.  Taurine also has anti-oxidant properties where by balancing all out where the salts and minerals are it helps prevent the cells from getting damage for taurine prevents oxygen from taking electrons from vitamins and minerals it should from necessary cell components.  All this mineral and where they are inside the cells vs inside the blood or between nerve cells is why taurine is sometimes good at reducing epilepsy risk.

Of course like many things too much Taurine can be toxic, even though the right amount of Taurine prevents other things from being toxic.

Like a lot of people, I'm in a relationship with someone who constantly points out the day to day things I could be better at... opening mail, putting things away... and honestly it's OK, there are things about the relationship that make it worthwhile.  I think I decided about five years ago that I would make an effort but fundamentally, I can't change having ADHD and won't ever be anywhere near a perfect housekeeper, and if my partner can't live with that I will understand.

Maybe some outside reinforcement would help.  I went to an open studio drawing class for a long time and got a lot of props from other people on certain things.  I post pictures of my drawings on social media and get a lot of good feedback.  The trick then, though, is not to tell yourself ""well, what do these people know"", as in the old Groucho Marx story about not wanting to join any club that would have you.

"6186","Yes I often have the same issues. ADHD is on a spectrum so the severity of each case varies by a large margin. 

I am on the severe side of it. I've been diagnosed for 11 years now and treated for at least 9 of those years with varying medication. 

Vyvanse is the best long lasting dosage medicine that there is. Next would be adderall xr which worked well for me for awhile until I got tired of going through forced withdrawal because of the need to get it authorized once a year. Many people supplement their evening with a booster adderall ir to avoid that terrible crash. 

Due to insurance in the USA being ridiculous, I am prescribed to take 3 doses of  adderall ir a day (totaling 60mg). I say it's ridiculous because my insurance pre authorized any generic form of vyvanse. The issue being that there is no generic form of it available for at least another few years leaving me with the option of paying out of pocket or going with the less efficient alternative which is 3 ir doses a day. 

Skip days are not the norm anymore. Your body can't become accustomed to the medicine if you consistently take breaks so you'll often struggle with the side effects like insomnia for much longer and much more often than those of us that don't skip days. 

The anger usually occurs after the dose has worn off correct? That's a pre withdrawal symptom in my personal experience. If you can, try to convince your doctor to allow you to enjoy your entire day with a fully functional brain by either prescribing a long lasting version combined with an evening booster, or at least 3 short term doses a day. It's unfortunate but that's just the case with this class of drugs. Your body does become dependent and lashes out when it no longer has it. But it's much preferable to the foggy brain feeling of untreated ADHD for me personally. ","dp6uqtz",2,1509546673,"2017-11-01 14:31:13"

"6203","I definitely struggle with this a lot. I'm not gonna pretend like I've figured my stuff out, but there's a couple things that work on me sometimes. 

the most important thing: you don't have to stick to a regular schedule to still have some sort of structure. I've found that a lot of suggestions for people with ADHD kinda tend to center around rigidly structuring your time, but that just doesn't work for me. it's  generally impossible for me to force myself to work on something when I say I should work on it, and if I miss one deadline on the schedule the whole thing just dies. 

allowing myself to take my time without checking the clock actually helps a lot, especially with tasks that might take longer than they should but do have a definitive end. like taking a shower. if I say I'm gonna be out of the shower in 15 and then I accidentally visit god in the shower and now it's been 16 minutes, then I'm like, oh, since I'm a giant failure anyway might as well spend three hours doing my makeup even though I'm definitely not going to leave my house today. 

but if I'm just like ""aight shower time"". and then I finish showering. that's it. the end of the shower. now I'm free. living like this has actually helped me lose a lot of the ""if I give myself an inch I'm gonna take six years"" kinda fear. 

anyway this is how I manage my ~~idiot~~ brain: 

**laundry**

don't think about the Whole Process. all you gotta do right now is floor + chair clothes -&gt; laundry basket -&gt; washing machine. that's it. obviously there's some big flaws in this strategy but at least now the clothes are wet so you can't just keep wearing them. if I have like a big assignment or something, it actually works better?  I just bring my Task and sit in the vicinity of the washing machine, and it works out pretty well in that when I need a small break from my task I can go change the laundry/fold some clothes but I hate laundry enough that I'll eventually go back to my task. 

still, like. my laundry is sitting in the washing machine as I type. 

**eating** 

my problems here are either a. not hungry or b. hungry but for some metaphysical concept inaccessible to lowly mortals. 

the way to get around this is to have some no effort options available. some people say things like sandwiches or leftover takeout are no effort options but they are wrong. if it can't go from its container to your stomach with zero byproducts it's not no effort. 

for example: cheerios are no effort because you can eat them dry and then you don't have to wash the bowl. and even if you want milk you just have to rinse the bowl. pizza that's already in your house is no effort because you can just shove it your mouth.  that's all I got right now. if it wasn't obvious I live on cheerios and sugar coffee unless I cave and get takeout at some ungodly hour. it's just sad to watch. drop your no effort meal suggestions below so I can add some spice to my life. 

**everything else you mentioned that would be really nice if I could figure out how to do:** 

that's a f in the chat for us all. 

**tldr:** if you want to do something, make doing it the path of least resistance. that's it. how do you do that? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

this is way longer than I expected and I'm not sure if this is what you were looking for lol but I hope it's at least a little helpful :)","fytd66t",2,1595371863,"2020-07-21 22:51:03"
"6204","This is an interesting thought that I've wondered myself plenty of times before. Ultimately, the two are inseparable. Conditions like adhd are not like having a dislocated shoulder, where it's dislocated or it's not, it's simply the way your brain is wired. As opposed to thinking about it like a solid tangible thing that I have, I always consider adhd an extension of myself. Everything I do is me, if I'm being lazy, that means I'm being lazy, and that in itself motivates me to go get stuff done because I can't stand being lazy. I find that when I tell myself my adhd is what's getting in the way, I allow it to become an excuse. It's easier said than done, and I have years of practice, and I'm by no means at all perfect, but I try to contribute things to myself instead of the adhd to keep myself accountable. As far as personality, I think only a personal soul search can answer that. I found out who I truly was when I went camping in the middle of nowhere in nature. Away from authority, away from technology, away from society, just a few of my best mates, just chilling and lots of self reflection in silence.

It adjusts your computer screen to produce less blue light. Blue light can trick your brain into staying awake longer than it should.

It won't help with the ADHD, but it will help stop your devices from colluding with natural biological processes to prevent you from feeling tired as you read. So you end up being more likely to fall asleep sooner whether you want to or not, lol.

Give it to your main doc then they take the teachers and yours and your kids circled numbers and form a diagnosis off something as bizzare as a bunch of numbers on a page. Then after that the shots are off then they want to try and prescribe some medication almost 99 percent of the time.

I had the same problem with ADHD at the age of 14, I got diagnosed by my doctor as being ADHD inattentive. So he wrote a script for Guanfacine and it just gave me bad anxiety for some reason. So as I'm telling him how it just makes me feel weird gives me anxiety which kinda makes my heart feel like it beats too fast he assumes I might have something wrong with my heart so it's best to play it safe. He was about to write a new script for instant release Ritalin before I told him how the Guanfacine made me feel.

So I sat there at 14 in this in between on one hand I've got school and the other is drugs and my doctor wasn't able to help me with the school part. So the only thing left was drugs, wow was that miserable I barely finished any of my assignments, never slept at a regular time, and I was always on a hand full of pills and caffeine just to give my brain something to work with. I've been a full blown drug addict for 2 years, I've been baker-acted twice, I left rehab, and I came back again for a second time. 

All of this happened and on top of an OD my mother lost her parental rights. But now I take Vyvanse 70mg and I'm right on track for being done with credits in a couple years.

"6286","Hey man, since it's been a good 6 hours I can answer this for you. Some doctors can diagnose you and put you on medication... however it will be difficult because their main prescription (Adderall) is highly controlled and highly abused. I do not recommend this, reason being is because my doctor did everything she could to tell me it was anxiety, and not ADHD. I went on prozac, and went into a weird 3 day depression. I stopped right after and switched doctors. I also went to a certified Neuro Psychiatrist. Each provider's practice varies. For me they have you fill out a computerized test on your behaviors, mental state, opinions, etc. Then they have you do a QB test, basically reaction time. They also sensor your movements. It is kind of interesting, but if you do have ADHD that test will surely tell. Depending on how well, or how bad you did, the psychiatrist will start you on medication at a low dose, and you go every so often to retake the QB test on your current meds, and he adjusts the dosage from there.","cq1rwta",2,1428221037,"2015-04-05 08:03:57"

"6322","We're not built to concentrate for long periods of time. What you're experiencing is very normal. You need to do this:

1. For prolonged periods of concentration (1.5 hours and longer), make sure you sip on a slightly sugary drink, like some tea with honey, lemonade, fruit juice, gatorade, whatever
2. At least every 30 minutes, but preferably every 15-20 minutes or so, take a 3-5 minute break, just like chill for a second. Best is to get-up, walk and stretch a little, but you can also just sit and wait. Literally just don't do anything related to whatever you're doing.

As Russel Barkley explains in his [treating ADHD with science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0) video, your executive function system (the part that makes you capable of making decisions) has a very small resource tank. Thinking, making decisions, working, concentrating etc all quickly deplete this tank (after ~30 minutes of concentration it's _looooowww_). Basically, this tank is literally just glucose in a certain part of your brain, just waiting and not doing anything gives your body/brain time to refill, and if you drink some sugary liquids, it will get to your brain really really quickly, so it won't empty so fast.

TL;DR: just take a 5 minute break every 30 minutes. And drink something slightly sugary if you're working for hours on end.","e4oz9kz",1,1535033327,"2018-08-23 14:08:47"

All with the belief that I was the only broken one.
 And so broken that I couldnt trust myself in my own home. Everywhere else I get along with people, read people well and remember.. but not at home
 Not with him. 
Over a decade trying desperately to fix things that werent fucking broken. 
Yes I still needed some help, hands down.. but a decade of confusion over why it never seemed to be quite enough. I was never enough..

"6340","One big thing is that you are confusing differences between these products.  Ritalin LA is a capsule with immediate and delayed release beads, and the FDA Prescribing information lists the following under Food Effects:

&gt;Administration times relative to meals and meal composition may need to be individually titrated.

&gt;When Ritalin LA was administered with a high fat breakfast to adults, Ritalin LA had a longer lag time until absorption began and variable delays in the time until the first peak concentration, the time until the interpeak minimum, and the time until the second peak. The first peak concentration and the extent of absorption were unchanged after food relative to the fasting state, although the second peak was approximately 25% lower. The effect of a high fat lunch was not examined.

&gt;There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of Ritalin LA when administered with applesauce, compared to administration in the fasting condition. There is no evidence of dose dumping in the presence or absence of food.

Concerta uses an osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system (OROS) that is much less affected by the GI environment.  The FDA Prescribing information lists the following:

&gt;In patients, there were no differences in either the pharmacokinetics or the
pharmacodynamic performance of CONCERTA¬Æ when administered after a high fat
breakfast. There is no evidence of dose dumping in the presence or absence of food.

The reason that assessment was made was because the Methylphenidate Hexal (a product from Hexal AG, subsidiary of Novartis) stated that it was bioequivalent to Concerta and could be taken with or without food, but the high fat meal showed different pharmacokinetics for the immediate release portion of Hexal compared to Concerta.  Basically, Hexal is like Ritalin LA in that the immediate release portion of the tablet can lag after a high fat meal.  Concerta does not have this issue.

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1185/030079902125000840

&gt;Amphetamine concentrations were markedly lower when the subjects had eaten breakfast, resulting in lower early drug exposures (p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). By contrast, methylphenidate concentrations over the same 8‚Äâh were unaffected by breakfast, providing consistent levels of early drug exposure. Therefore, as a child's or adult's eating pattern varies, methylphenidate exposure over the first 8‚Äâh would be expected to have less day-to-day variation compared with amphetamine exposure. The osmotic-controlled OROS¬Æ tablet provides a reliable and consistent delivery of methylphenidate HCl, independent of food, for patients with ADHD.","e0o5g2i",4,1528996814,"2018-06-14 17:20:14"

"6342","I take 20 mg of short acting Adderall daily and my experience is different than yours.  

It doesn't make me sleepy but, it does make me slow down some and think things through more thoroughly.  I usually take the Adderall around 7:15 AM and I start to feel the effects around 7:45-8:00.  Since I don't usually eat breakfast, my dose kicks in fairly hard initially.  I become chatty for about 20-30 minutes and then things settle down.  Once things settle down and the chatty phase has passed, I am able to focus significantly better until around 2 in the afternoon.  During this period I can be so focused that I avoid getting up to use the bathroom or eat.  It's almost like the focus and progress are addictive.  The downside to Adderall, for me, is the afternoon crash.  By around 5:00 PM I'm crashing and and I get hungry and irritable.  

It seems like Adderall might not be the right medication for you.  The various medications affect each person differently.  Is this your first medication or are you switching from something else?  If this is your first medication I might would tell your doctor and see if they want to try another medication.  ","csq9ng9",2,1435869386,"2015-07-02 20:36:26"

""Executive functions (EFs) make possible mentally playing with ideas; taking the time to think before acting; meeting novel, unanticipated challenges; resisting temptations; and staying focused. Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control‚Äîresisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking ‚Äúoutside the box,‚Äù seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances). The developmental progression and representative measures of each are discussed. Controversies are addressed (e.g., the relation between EFs and fluid intelligence, self-regulation, executive attention, and effortful control, and the relation between working memory and inhibition and attention). The importance of social, emotional, and physical health for cognitive health is discussed because stress, lack of sleep, loneliness, or lack of exercise each impair EFs. That EFs are trainable and can be improved with practice is addressed, including diverse methods tried thus far""","fdr1a5f",1,1578678133,"2020-01-10 17:42:13"

"6408","Chiming in to agree with the first commenter.  The meds boost your dopamine and make it easier to focus, but you need to pair that with good habits and routines.  If you have access to it, I'd suggest seeing a therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy.  People with ADHD are one of the groups that can really benefit, as the whole point is not just to help you change your thoughts, but to help you develop better behaviors as well to really get the most out of your meds and your life.

If you can't or would rather not see a therapist (which I can understand, it took me years to get there, for one, even after I suspected ADHD for many of those years before my diagnosis too), then taking your meds daily and developing a routine of doing homework/studying for a certain amount of time each day will help.  

If you're using meds to ""catch up on"" homework, that sounds like you're already in the habit of procrastinating and treating the meds like a booster for a last-minute cram session.  That's not how they're designed to work, and is an example of how coping mechanisms we build up from years of undiagnosed ADHD can actually be detrimental instead of helpful when we start taking meds.  Many people with ADHD find that the rush of adrenaline that comes with a rapidly approaching deadline helps them sit down and cram a bunch of work into a few hours, because that adrenaline rush has some chemical similarities to our meds.  If you're on meds, however, you can end up discovering that the adrenaline rush of cram time that used to be helpful now just floats right on by, and instead of sitting down to work you go do other things.  Meds can, for many people, make it easier not just to focus, but to *change* focus at will.  Thus, if what you need is the hyperfocus of a good frenzied panic (where by ""good,"" here, I mean not actually very good for your health, organization, or ability to actually finish stuff in the long run), the meds are working against you.

(Obviously, all that can vary person to person, which is why you also hear stories about people who find ADHD meds very useful for last minute cram sessions.  But you have to go by how your brain works, not anyone else's.)

Solid routines and organization of time and tasks, on the other hand, are helpful for a lot of people.  It's just easier for those of us with ADHD to get into them when we're taking our medication on a daily basis.","egc9czq",1,1550011142,"2019-02-12 22:39:02"

@u/Tasihasi Hope you find a system that works for you. Seconding that beating yourself up is rarely helpful. I think most of us have experienced this and it's hard so you deserve to give yourself a break, feeling frustrated with yourself will ironically help you stay feeling stuck. Your thoughts influence reality so much of the time so try not to frame the narrative in your head that it's something you can't do or like being up against a brick wall.  If your attitude to overcoming it begins with, it's a challenge that i need to find a creative system to deal with to reflect the way I work as an individual, it maybe shifts the perspective. It won't work unless you believe that it's possible for mornings to be different. For me I would start thinking about times when I had been able to get out of bed; what was it that motivated me? Is there something you enjoy that you could make part of your morning routine, to give that extra impetus, and also maybe take the pressure off - you're now focusing on your new habit rather than your old problem.

Our rule is that we need scientific studies and/or papers that show non-standard medications have efficacy in treating the disorder being discussed.

"6413","Uhm.. I struggle with the same problem. I know the feeling and I can imagine you must be going through a hard time right now. Sadly there is not really a cure from what I understand of the literature. If you're lucky you will maybe grow out of it.

I get what you are describing a lot, although more often I just freeze and do nothing. I know what I have to do but I'm just not doing anything. I'm just literally sitting in my chair staring at my laptop doing nothing. This goes with a clenched feeling in my stomach and just a sort of paralysed feeling.

Changing your environment is important and stuff but for me the most helpful thing is understanding what is going on. You have to realize that ADHD/ADD is a disorder of motivation. It impairs you in generating motivation for action that are going to benefit you in the future. The important thing here is that you KNOW what to do but you DON'T FEEL a need, a drive to actually do it. The thing you are feeling bad about is not the fact that you are not doing your homework, it is the fact that you are not doing anything productive that moment. This feeling of not being productive is removed by your avoidant behaviour. Which, if you look at it, is behaviour that satisfies your immediate needs: eating foods, going to bathroom, looking up solutions for problems you have right now. But then these actions are done or you remember what you are supposed to do and you feel bad again. So the first step is to acknowledge and understand this avoidant behaviour.

I don't like making to long post so if you want to know more just ask me. After acknowledging this behaviour I do a few other steps to be productive but I haven‚Äôt found a fool proof solution yet.

I know this isn't exactly a solution to your problem but I hope this helps you understand what is going on better and thereby maybe making you feel a bit better. ","cwxrdyg",9,1447343284,"2015-11-12 15:48:04"

I feel like my mind has been operating with one area locked away on a secret room - I knew the door was there but it was always locked so I had no way of knowing what was behind it - now that door has been opened up to me and I feel like I have more room in my head to process everything and to use!! It‚Äôs still not easy or 100% but it‚Äôs definitely better, I can definitely See and feel an improvement. And other people have noticed it too, my family now see me as a reliable person who has themselves together.

Not sure about how you would fare with song lyrics etc, I feel like (in my case anyway) the meds more help me to organise thoughts in my head and prioritise my day accordingly - like before I would forget what I was doing that day because my mind was so disorganised and crowded and messy - think of a warehouse where the boxes are falling off the shelves and all open etc - whereas now I can organise my thoughts and focus on my day as I‚Äôve planned it in my head working my way through it in an organised way so much more aware of the tasks I need to remember and complete - I feel like I can take out a box froM the warehouse, find what I need and put the box back in its place nice and neat! I even plan ahead now! Something I very rarely did before, I put my keys back in the same spot, put important documents next to the door on the right days I need them all from memory and not from a post it telling me to or from an alarm on my phone reminding me. 

If you want to improve memory you should definitely check out what apps etc you can use to do that, and if your on meds they will help you focus that time specifically on memory and you should see a massive improvement because your able to focus on the information or lesson on memory improvement.

"6425","&gt;For maybe a couple months this has really been nagging at me quite a bit.  
&gt;  
&gt;I  feel like I have no association with myself from just last year, maybe  even six months ago. I read my journal entries and it feels as if  someone else wrote them. They are vaguely familiar, but they don‚Äôt feel  like anything I could understand.

I feel exactly the same way except I've come to terms with having no long-term memory, and barely any short-term memory. The short-term memory is better with medication but the long-term memory is something I just don't get to have. I've come to terms with those limitations. I don't like them but I'm done trying to fight them.

As far as finding things that only you could have written but have no memory of, and that pertain to things you don't remember either, it's not fun. I find it disturbing, creepy, and legitimately terrifying sometimes but there's nothing I can do about it. I've resigned to it.

&gt;I can remember some things, but I remember the fact or maybe an image  that I‚Äôve run in my head many times, but I have no emotions attached to  them, like they weren‚Äôt even mine.

Same deal here. I don't see any similarity between myself now and ""me"" in elementary, middle, or even highschool‚Äîand I only graduated from highschool last year. I don't know why everyone insists on equating me with the ""me"" from just a year ago. We have little in common, few shared memories, and hardly anything else.

&gt;It‚Äôs very frustrating because whenever I, say, try to compare my current  mental state with my mental state from months ago: i cannot. It feels  like I can‚Äôt remember who I am, or like I‚Äôve only been aware for a very  short time. it‚Äôs very upsetting to me because It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt remember  enough to understand what I‚Äôve forgotten.

Same here, it feels like it's straight out of a movie.

For context I am diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD‚Äîcommon comorbidities with ADHD. People will blame those 3 mental illnesses for my dissociative symptoms but the issue is I don't think I even meet diagnostic criteria for any of them anymore. I think I'm just a partial amnesiac. As far as that having anything to do with ADHD, I have no clue but I can't rule it out either. I would like an answer, though.","fi3xgfi",1,1582129695,"2020-02-19 16:28:15"

"6429","Well, people do sometimes outgrow ADHD. It‚Äôs a neurodevelopmental disorder, so it affects things like the chemicals in the brain and the growth and development of different parts of your brain.

So they don‚Äôt actually have ADHD anymore. Like how some kids are really small until they have a growth spurt and catch up to the normal height of their peers, but in their brains. Whereas those of us whose brains continue to have the differences associated with ADHD continue on with our ADHD lives, never ‚Äúgrowing out of it‚Äù just like some people are short their whole lives.

I've been diagnosed for about 7 years now, with depression and anxiety. I recently made the decision to get reevaluated and put back on meds. And let me tell you...with a diagnosis, it is SO EASY to fall into a victim complex. I mean, I get to be my awful, mean, horrible self and now I have an excuse!

Except, no, I don't, because I'm still obligated to be a decent human being.

If I take your post as gospel truth, it sounds like your husband is a King Dildo who has no desire to improve your marriage, no desire for communication, and he's looking out for #1.  I have very little patience for childishness and dicks. Though, I must say, agreeing to go to the doctor, take meds, and go to therapy is a very huge thing.




Anyway. Medication helps me with my moods because I am able to process and articulate my feelings more efficiently. However, when I come down, I have to make an enormous effort not to willfully hurt those around me.

The Concerta crash will be something you need to keep under control. You might be very sensitive to changes in mood, incredibly tired, get a headache, or the likes. I highly recommend being in a place where you can rest for a while, get yourself in order. It's dangerous to drive due to the overwhelming desire to sleep. Road rage is likely. This crash takes me 2 or 3 hours to pass.

Once the crash passes, the pill will have some acting effects on you but not usually strong. Keeps you behaved the rest of the day though.

I'd say now, try it over the weekend once or twice to know how it effects you. Watch the clock and keep tabs on when you took it and what is happening, this way you're ready for its effects at school.","d3llt3s",1,1464346997,"2016-05-27 11:03:17"

When your calmly tell yourself that you have to get up in the next 10 minutes it‚Äôs stronger and more effective than aggressively telling yourself to get up because you are able to be comfortable expressing an uncomfortable action. Anger is a coping mechanism for experiencing something you don‚Äôt like, if you can acknowledge your anger when it happens you‚Äôll have clarity with the raw source of it and confronting the source becomes less uncomfortable.

"6513","Diagnosed ADHD when I was very young and I was diagnosed a second time at 21. I stopped taking medicine in 3rd grade. Ended up passing law school and 2 bar exams without any use of medication. This best study tips I can give are these. 

1. Set daily goals and stick to them. It doesn‚Äôt matter what others are doing studying that day. Just stick to your goal and when you‚Äôre done with them go home. If you‚Äôre done in 3 hours and everyone else studied 5 don‚Äôt worry about it. If you control your focus you can do amazing things. 

2. This goes off of step 1. Structure is most important. ADHD plus chaos leads to a lot of wasted time. Structure is creating a plan and sticking to it. I struggle with this now as I got a million things going on at work and total chaos so I have to keep a to do list to keep me on task. But when I studied and was able to focus on structure, it always led to success. 

3. Isolate yourself. The easiest way to do this is to study in a cubicle or by listening to music. Words in music distract me so I listen to movie themes and classical. By playing music you can drown everything else out and cut down distractions. I do this at work now still so I don‚Äôt hear other conversations and I‚Äôm able to get a lot done. 

4. Keep a particular space for studying only. At school this was always the library. That way if I was there I knew I was studying and it was easier to stay on task. And when I finally left that space I knew it was okay to do other fun things. Trust me on this one. It makes a world of difference. 

There are more tips but these are the biggest I feel for me! Hope this helps someone studying for exams. Best of luck!

I've started to do two things which seem to be helping

1. Daily meditation in the morning. The goal here is when I do get side-tracked meditation will help me to build the skills to stay on task and let thoughts go (like your chips thought) which don't serve us in the moment.
2. Making a list. Once you get all the things that you can think of out in the open and onto a list, then you can begin to prioritize them. That way you don't waste time doing unrelated, low priority things that ultimately might be relevant later but not right now in the current moment. From some high level planning, you may have written down chips on the list and then been able to decide that it wasn't important, thereby preventing you from going down the chips thought path.","fe961he",1,1578934660,"2020-01-13 16:57:40"

"6523","ADHD doesn't actually _require_ physical hyperactivity, in fact I think the vast majority of ADHD-pi people would agree they are mentally hyperactive not literally jumping off the walls, just feeling like it. Most of us seem to have milder physical symptoms. 

ADD was combined under the umbrella of ADHD a while ago, so you have ADHD combined, ADHD primarily hyperactive and ADHD primarily inattentive. Your still one of us if your in the PI group!

Things I've been called out on though,

* Tripping, bumping into things, no sense of space, no pre-thinking of can I fit there or can that support me.
* Foot taping, humming, playing with hair, nail biting, looking away from the teacher, being unable to keep watching a movie, slumping in my seat at the movie theatre and trying to pick up popcorn with my feet, folding loose empty post its before thinking. 
* Jumping in to conversations and topics, emotional impulsivity and feeling things too strongly and suddenly, not thinking through dishes and laundry and occasionally fucking those up cause I was like I will do this now! Singing along to music in languages I can't speak and doing a horrible job.

Now, none of these are enough alone to call hyperactive, but they are all pretty big ass signs of ADHD and major issues for me. It sucks. Try to stop worrying about what title you get for your ADHD, whatever it is a good doctor should also be offering you recommendations when you get your results.","edkiqf1",1,1546966090,"2019-01-08 16:48:10"

"6533","I‚Äôve never felt like depression has been an organic issue for me. Maybe as an adolescent, but I think that may go hand and hand with adolescence lol.

I‚Äôve certainly clocked a lot of time being miserable and frustrated, but that, to me, is different. The first year after I quit doing speed, I was pretty much clinically depressed because of my brain chemistry being off and needing time to recover. I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone, but I understood what was happening, that it was temporary, and got through it. 

I‚Äôm sorry, I forgot if you said you were going to a psychiatrist or gp. If it wasn‚Äôt a psychiatrist, find one. If it was, and you really don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre clinically depressed, reiterate that, and demand to be tested for adhd.

A lot of depression is situational, not clinical. Untreated adhd will absolutely make you miserable, for years on end. If your Dr. doesn‚Äôt understand that, find another one. I hope that won‚Äôt be difficult. So much of the trauma of adhd is the constant stream of other people erroneously assigning feelings to us. We‚Äôre not trying, we don‚Äôt care, we‚Äôre lazy, we‚Äôre selfish, we‚Äôre weak, etc. If you ask me, that‚Äôs one of the worst parts and really does a number on your self-image. Personally, that took me years to overcome. I believed all that and hated myself, flat-out, which is probably why I was so self-destructive. Being medicated has allowed me to realize the potential everyone constantly told me I was wasting, and build a life where I have things to lose. Before that, I certainly felt like I had nothing to lose, which didn‚Äôt make me very happy. I don‚Äôt think that was depression, I think it was circumstance. 

As a side note, I never tell health care professionals I had a drug problem anymore. Some may understand, but most don‚Äôt, and brand a scarlet letter on your forehead.

Maybe try doing stuff in the mornings that make you happy or feel like you to avoid this from happening. For example, mornings really set the tone for my day. So I try to do stuff that I love really early like listening to house music, giving someone in my family a hug, or playing with my cat outside. 

But if I do wake up and do feel emotionally bland, I try to counteract it by taking a cold shower or a quick nap in the middle of the day to reset lol.

Being around friends and mentors who point out that the abusive and neglectful behavior I experienced from them wasn't normal is another big one. I'm more successful than anyone in my immediate family combined and it's not because I am all things awful.

I told my mom honestly that I never understood why she and dad had kids and that the last time I went an entire year without contemplating suicide is when I was 7. I was shocked when she cried about it. ""I didn't know you felt that way."" Ummm... Wtf did you THINK I would feel? Gratitude? I'm an ungrateful, disrespectful, self absorbed child, remember? My dad has stronger signs of narcissism, so talking to him about stuff like smashing my head into a wall and screaming or spanking me until I bled for not cleaning my room and keeping it clean will likely never happen. Supposedly, he doesn't remember doing these things and was diagnosed with an emotional regulation disorder. I think it's either bipolar or narcissism, TBH but what can you do?

Anyways, I can completely relate to you. My issues with anxiety are largely under control now and I'm working through depression. For the depression, I drink Kava with cacao powder and hazelnut milk to somewhat alleviate it and I make myself get out of the house or exercise.  What has helped me with anxiety is realizing that I was taught that the consequences of my actions will always be morbidly unproportional or even outright inappropriate to the situation. Realizing that I'm not going to be kept inside my bedroom or hit or demeaned or infantilized for a human error like absentmindedness or short term memory problems has been significant.

I think I really have my friend to thank, he has really really helped me. 

I auctually used to be a bit rude about lgbtq, I didn‚Äôt understand especially growing up in a cis, het, homophobic, transphobic, etc community. There are rarely openly lgbtq, especially when I was younger, so that lead to me silently judging gay people a bit.

But now, years later I‚Äôm auctyally lgbtq lol! My friend had came out to me and that really helped me fix stuff, because I loved them and I was never going to unfriend them because of who they were. 

If I loved them when I thought they were cis, het, because I love them as a person, I could love them for being open and being themselves!

I would ask your psychiatrist what sort of experience/background he has in treating ADHD, especially when it may be comorbid with another illness.  But basically, I believe I would tell him my concerns about having ADHD and ask for further testing, or ask him if he would be comfortable in exploring treatment for that.

He may bring up the issue of stimulants causing mania in bipolar patients, but be prepared for this, especially if it seems like he is putting up obstacles just to deflect the subject.  Articles from ADD websites, such as ADDitude, have much information on this exact topic.

If your doctor is a no-go for exploring the possibility of ADHD, consider the options you have for going elsewhere.  I don't want to push the diagnosis of ADHD upon you (I'm not an MD), but I have had major issues with mistaken diagnosis's and inappropriate treatment.

"6620","I just looked, and ""disordered attention"" is not a diagnosis in the DSM-V that I can see. Basically it's all on a spectrum, and if the psychiatrist doesn't see it as affecting your domains of functioning (i.e. social life, work, self-esteem, etc) to enough of a degree for a diagnosis, it can sometimes be called like ""unspecified type"" or something similar. If you find that ADHD medication gives you clarity, soothes the restlessness, allows you to better follow through on/stay on tasks, then it's likely you have the neurological brain structure of ADHD. If you're happy with the amount you've been prescribed, and it's working, then I guess stick with it! If the lack of a diagnosis or the amount you've been prescribed isn't working out for you, maybe think about searching around for another psychiatrist/psychologist - preferably one that specialises in ADHD!! Unfortunately even in the psychological community the disorder is massively misunderstood/stigmatised.   


If you want a bit of a picture of how severely this is affecting your day-to-day functioning, you can always take the [Jasper-Goldberg Adult ADHD screening test](https://www.associatedtherapists.com/Forms---Questionnaires/adultaddscreening.pdf) to see where you may fall on the spectrum.","et5oh3w",1,1562481911,"2019-07-07 06:45:11"

I cannot advocate for you to start meds or refrain but can only give you my experience on the matter. I felt the same when I was first diagnosed too: I didn't want the meds to control me or to be dependent on them etc. However, I felt that non-medication coping methods were not working, and my symptoms were becoming a daily struggle which led me to think that I might  need something else. That was my tipping point and my psyc gave me a seven day trial of 10 mg Adderall to see how it affected me and let me tell you the difference was NIGHT AND DAY.

You need to report your disability to HR for ADA.

What then will happen is you will go through a work session with them of defining areas of your job description that you would need reasonable accommodations. 

After all this, they will inform your supervisor that you have accommodations and what they are, they will not tell them what disability you have.

The specific accommodation this post refers to, is receiving clear and written instructions for tasks/projects that are assigned to you. 

Once it is documented with HR, it would be illegal to not adhere to the accommodations, or fire you if the accommodations were not being adhered to.","eqy8kfh",2,1560379164,"2019-06-12 22:39:24"

There are a *lot* of ADHD people in the LGBT community. I'm not sure it's actually more than in the straight world \- I think it's more that the community \(especially women\) tend to be more open about discussing mental health. Anyway, you're definitely not going to be the only ADHD person there, and for the most part people I've told about my ADHD have responded well.

That said, don't expect that dating women is going to be all happiness and rainbows. Most of the problems in the straight world also exist in our world. There are women who are abusive to their partners. There are women who abuse drugs and might try to steal your meds. It is easier to miss the red flags with women, and often harder to end things because they may have a trauma history/mental health issue that you empathize with, but you *can't* fix them, and you should never stay with someone whose behavior harms you, no matter what excuse they have.

Sorry to take things in a negative direction in the last paragraph \-\- the vast majority of lesbian/bi/queer women are *not* like that \-\- but newly\-out women seem particularly vulnerable to ending up in bad situations because they didn't realize it could still happen with women. Don't be afraid, just be aware.

That said, the majority of lesbian/bi/queer women are awesome. You are on your way to meeting some amazing people, and I hope you have a great time!

Regarding thinking non\-stop about someone you're falling for \-\- that's called a crush. If you've been dating your non\-preferred gender up until now, you may not have experienced this before, and it might feel a little weird. It's perfectly normal! Think about the other girls you knew in high school, when they first got boy\-crazy, and started doodling some guy's name in their notebooks... you're finally getting to feel what they felt. Don't expect the intensity to last, you'll eventually discover that your crush is not perfect \- but you can still be in love even after the intensity of the crush is gone.","dzx9560",2,1527827587,"2018-06-01 04:33:07"

My son is 20. But we have already paid (and he has failed) two years of an expensive university. So he came back home, and he's now in community college and working. His therapist told us to back off -- not be involved in his school and his obtaining of his meds. Immediately his grades went downhill, and he forgot to have a very serious medication (life-threatening for some people if they don't take it) refilled for two months. So we as parents are involved again. 

He is a great person, my son. Love him to death. He's extremely responsible about work, he does his schoolwork well. We now realize he needs PLANNING help, probably with almost everything. Needs a secretary of sorts. I don't mind doing that, to a point.

But I tell him consistently, we need to see some sort of progress. AND, I'm in my late fifties. I have raised three children, and I need a chance to live my own life now, within reason. I don't want to spend my entire life raising this last son. At some point, he will get kicked out and will have to learn how to live with the consequences of his actions. He knows this. He may not want to face it, but he knows it.

Like your Mom, I can see that we will have to pay for insurance when he's older. We are trying very hard to steer him toward a bachelor's (and god-willing, a master's) degree that will be appropriate for him, will be interesting, and will pay enough that he can survive on his own income.

After a while, your parents just get TIRED. This is a long haul, raising someone who basically doesn't truly grow up until they are 30-35, and hopefully they are grown up at that point. Some parents luck out, and their child marries someone who takes over the ""secretarial"" duties. Don't get me wrong -- our son helps out at home, he's fun to be around, I adore this guy.

The most important is to build your environment around how you do your best work. Separate work and play areas as much as possible (ideally different rooms), and put anything you need to do before leaving near the door so you see it on the way out. Set up visual reminders for anything you can. 

Keep a bullet journal (instructions at bulletjournal.com). Those have a kind of reward built in because you can stop copying over items to the next day when you finish them. The draw back is that you have to keep the notebook with you and you might lose it but they are incredibly effective

Misguided focus, increased anxiety and suicidal ideation and my nurse said 'oh, we'll just increase your dose over your period, that should fix it' it most certainly did not. I went through three types of medication in that time.

As for the long meeting in the morning, I have asked to be able to leave after my clients are discussed instead of staying and listening to in depth Conversation about each client on the unit whom I will have zero interaction with. Perhaps HR would support this request when my supervisors did not. I have also asked for assistance with administrative work such as pulling charts and filing and faxing but was told no to this as well. I will include this request as well.   I like your idea about asking for a one hour lunch this would be helpful. Some days I work through my lunch and breaks and barely have enough time to do the job. They ask us to do more and more things but never take anything away.  My direct supervisor is a borderline personality disorder nightmare.  

I've worked for this Company for 18 years including four when I was in college.  This is the first time I've ever asked for accommodation although I can see where I really could've used in the past. Although I hate the medication I finally take it regularly and only on days that I work.

Have you worked out how long it will be before there are disastrous consequences of not getting paid? That might spur you on to action?

Does a non-professional minimum wage type of job seem preferable? It might be an interesting change of pace if you haven't done that kind of work before/for a long time.

You could book to see a careers advisor to help with CV writing and job search advice. The meeting/discussion/follw up etc might make you accountable to someone else and get you going. You can find free services (the uni you graduated from, job centres in the UK iirc).

Let the doctor determine the medication that is best for you.  And try many and many dosages if they are not giving you the effects you want.  Use it regularly, and monitor your side effects.  Its just about trying to find a balance of enough 'uptime' and managing side effects to tolerable levels (which get better with regular proper usage).

you learn how to not say these things but you find that people are saying that youre someone who is hard to get close to, even though when you talk you talk a lot and intensely. but the thing is that if youre totally yourself youre generally hurting people, often in very cutting ways and blissfully unaware, or so aware you have terrible anxiety over everything you say. i used to trail off my conversations as soon as people made eye contact lol","d3qpper",1,1464720319,"2016-05-31 18:45:19"

"6771","&gt;vague and arbitrary questions that can apply to almost any situation

They aren't really vague at all, nor are they arbitrary. They are the questions with the greatest predictive power.

You're also forgetting the other part of the diagnostic criteria: 

* Several symptoms are present in two or more setting, (e.g., at home, school or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).
* There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, school, or work functioning.
* The symptoms do not happen only during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g. Mood Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Dissociative Disorder, or a Personality Disorder).

The checklist is a screening tool to assist detection and see if further investigation is warranted.

I was seeing a psychologist for the past 3 years (who looking back now I absolutely despise, I organised one last appointment with him tomorrow so I can vent my rage at his failure to diagnose). 
Then I saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ASD, anxiety, MDD, OCD with potential ADD/ADHD (she said she couldn't tell because my depression may have been causing my inattentiveness). She refused to see me again because I was 'too difficult a case' and I think she was scared of me really (I told her I'd tried methamphetamine and had serious anger management).
Finally, I saw a PROPER psychiatrist actually qualified to do his job (he's a professor). His first question was 'do you think you have ADHD' and my immediate response was a firm 'no', due to the stigma associated and I didn't want to come off as a drug seeker. After telling him that amphetamines calmed me down, he came to the conclusion that I did in fact have ADD - and he's definitely correct.

The crash was 1/10, but would last till I slept. The crash was so mild for me that I didn't even realize I was crashing, took me a while to piece it together. If I didn't have to study, I would take 30mg of this daily.

AdderallXR seems to have the least side effects for me, so I've been sticking with it.

"6846","This will seem like an overly severe way to deal with things to you probably but it's because I have a lot of other problems that exacerbated my ADHD and the first 30 years of my life was constant and utter failure. You may be able to scale this back and adapt it to yourself though. Anyway, I've been told that when growing up with the problems I had and then being able to shed them as an adult uncovered parts of myself that I didn't know existed. Unfortunately they are still in a childlike state because they were never allowed to grow along side everything else. As hard as you can be on yourself for making a mistake as an adult, you are levying that adult harshness against something that is possibly still in a child like state of development. Do your best to immediately extinguish negative thoughts because they are not what you would say to a child. You have to be able to forgive yourself for your mistakes and be able to do so with an internal tone of a parent that is trying to encourage a child to grow.

Have you ever seen the movie ""Good Will Hunting""? I think the most pivotal scene in the movie is when Dr. Maguire acts as this parental and forgiving voice that Will needed to hear and having heard it for the first time in his life he breaks down.

You said:

&gt; I can't count how many times that I've been told that I should be more confident and proud of who I am, as if it was some choice that I was choosing incorrectly.

So maybe throughout your life you've lived and grown with an underdeveloped sense of accomplishment and this is your adult mentality being overly harsh and oppressive of your sense of accomplishment? It will feel silly to you I'm sure, and probably forced the first few times if you decide to try it. It did for me as well, but I found it a lot easier to do this by mentally picturing my son or daughter in front of me, crying because of their (my) mistake, and then as their father I naturally try to console them and encourage them. Then I take their place as a child and repeat it back to myself.

Maybe you could picture a young child in front of you, it was their accomplishment, congratulate and reward them as you think a parent would, and then picture yourself as that child and receive it. Don't think about how you could have done better, because that's not what you would say to a child. Was it an accomplishment deserving of an ice cream? Go actually get yourself an ice cream or do something for yourself that you know makes you feel good but also make the effort to mentally attach whatever it is to the accomplishment you made.

"6859","Unless you have major or dangerous side effects (seizures, in particular), it's best to ignore the side effects for the first week or two of a new medication. Let your brain adapt, then make a judgment once you've reached equilibrium.

&gt; The whole purpose of WB is that it releases dopamine right?

I urge you to not focus on the mechanism of action, because it's complicated and not as useful for understanding things as you may think. But because you asked: Bupropion and its several metabolites do have relatively weak affinities for the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, which means signaling with those two catecholamines will be prolonged slightly because bupropion interferes slightly with those two compounds being pulled (basically) back in to the neurons to terminate the transmission. Your brain will ""notice"" that transmission at these junctions is altered and will compensate over the course of several days and weeks until you reach a sort of homeostasis.

It also interacts with several nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which aren't very well understood yet but are almost certainly involved in the therapeutic effects as well as the side effects. Again, these systems will re-regulate over time until you reach a balance.

Basically, you have to wait it out before you really know how it will treat you. Just make sure you're not having any seizures.","czvbapb",2,1455143419,"2016-02-10 22:30:19"

He said it's very common especially for people older patients with an ""adult ADHD"" diagnosis. After, like the 10th doubt suggestion, he finally firmly said:

""Look this is my specialty. I'm an MD who has been doing research, and studies on ADHD since before it had it's name in the 70s. Trust me, you have it. Like other Spectrum Disorders, people can shift and fall into different shades of severity. Normally I don't like to rigidly categorize patients, but ADHD has been crippling to you. Not only do you have it- you have it in SPADES!""

I don't want to shit talk my husband but the things you mentioned are the struggles that I have with him and I think it's important for people to recognize *what kind of effort* can help your spouse cope better with your disorder.

I've worked really fucking hard to learn time management skills. I was raised by someone with severe ADHD and learned so few real world skills from her that it is just depressing to think about. I have a white board calendar in my kitchen, I have my phone calendar filled up, I have taught myself how to organize my day to day life better than I ever thought possible even though I still have more work to do. I've also had to work hard to be more aware about my bad habits during task completion and break certain thought patterns that prevent me from starting and stopping things when I'm supposed to. It isn't perfect yet but I feel like I'm pretty self aware and try hard.

My husband took medication and changed zero habits, and lo and behold, nothing fucking changed for me. He felt better in his own head but he still leaves trails of destruction behind him as he completes tasks. He is a sweet and loving person who always keeps trying BUT he has made no real constructive changes in how he communicates his struggles or asks for help and he hasn't been very receptive to any suggestions I've had for him. This idea that he can just come home and change the way his disorder affects his actions through sheer willpower is not working out for him and even though I understand he means well, it makes me feel frustrated with his behaviors and like I'm taking care of a child who isn't really taking responsibility for their actions through methods that WORK.

This meme can be used either positively or negatively, it can be used to remind you of all the good things you have, or it can be used to shame and make you feel like a guilty party.

I like who I am, but feel I have so much more to offer in my lifetime than what I'm able to do. I just feel buried under multiple layers of multi-layer disorders. I cherish the benefits ADHD gives me and do feel we are all perfect in our ""imperfections"", but if I could harness just 20% of what I know I'm capable of- that would be enough for me.


I've seen glimpses of it with some medications (and it is fucking awesome), but they either stop working or I end up in the ER with a new heart condition, blinding migraine and now something is up with my kidneys.


I was diagnosed in my 30s and it was life-changing. It allowed me to completely re-frame my childhood, to forgive my family, and most of all forgive myself after a lifetime of self-hate.


Sorry to rant... I'm just so frustrated. I know all about structure, excercise, diet, meditation and I work so hard to do them ALL! But the bottom line is the medication is what brings it all together for me, and I'm almost willing to put my life on the line just to be functional again.

"6913","This is definitely not enough to warrant reconsidering your career bud. The whole point of those evals is to let you know what you can improve on. Frankly, it was nice of them to say something more than ""read more"" and at least make you aware of these issues. I'm guessing you still passed the rotation, and even if you didn't, you know what you need to work on in order to pass. 

1. Chronic Lateness: Is your lateness in the morning or more for meetings? As a student in the medical field if you're on time you're late. Plan on arriving 10-15 minutes early. Adjusting for ADHD, plan on arriving 20-30 minutes early. Part of this is to put you in your place as low man on the totem pole. Have a book handy to read while you wait.

2. Interrupting: A lot of what helped me with this was medication if I'm being honest. One thing I tried to do before medication was when I thought someone was done speaking I would try to count to 3 before speaking. If I made it to 3 they were done. It was frustrating, exhausting, and emotionally taxing and thankfully meds helped a lot for me. 

3. Deadlines: I didn't end up struggling with this personally either prior to medication or after. I guess I'm just not too bad of a procrastinator. A lot of it is breaking things up into smaller tasks and assigning yourself mini deadlines, that way you won't miss the big one because you have most of it done already.

"6958","The problem is our society, school, work environments, etc. are largely built around people with typical executive function. We don't have typical executive function, so if we want to have a measure of productivity within that institution we must do something (CBT, medication, etc.) to put ourselves in a state where we can operate at the same level as our peers. 

The psychology is actually pretty conservative about forcing meds on people. Diagnosis requires this condition to be met:

&gt; There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, school, or work functioning.

And even with diagnosis there's no requirement for you to be put on meds to solve it. Though meds are an important and helpful option in most cases. 

Before I was diagnosed I embraced my ADHD tendencies as just components of my personality.

You did a great job of responding to my comment but you probably should be studying. *-)

Did you follow the link from one of the mods about exploring resources at your college? You have a disability, if it was officially diagnosed, you have a legal right to accommodations. 

I've seen many very intelligent people come through here who struggled painfully to get through college, but they did. Given what that can mean in terms of income, it must be worth it. But, I know people with a tech or trade school education who are making lots of money, more than some college graduates. 

You're right. No matter where you go, there you are. 

Reconsidering a serious run at medication is something to think about. Your trial may not have been the right drug or dose. It takes time. You seem like the ideal candidate. Medication doesn't fix everything but it makes it a bit easier to access the better parts of ourselves. 

I wish you the best of luck.

I've been depressed before and one of my best friends is slowly climbing out of her own personal lowest atm and one of the things we often talk about is how all the good advice (work on your day/night, go take a walk) all doesn't really work until it suddenly does and that it's so hard to pinpoint what thing caused the change from going from 'o god I should take a walk, but then I need to get dressed and do laundry and probably eat something first, oh god I need to go shopping...nvm' to 'yeah, a walk would be nice'. 

Perhaps reading things more aimed at depression could help a bit (I personally liked Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), or find things that can help the time go a little bit faster during the wait could make it a little less miserable. I really do understand that aiming for 'passing the time' is a shitty thing to do and it can be incredibly frustrating to have to do that, when there's a part of you that's unhappy exactly because that's the only thing you can do.

Never. Think. Along. These. Lines.

You are not perfect, nor is anyone else. Your chances are amazing in this day and age. You can literally become anything you can dream up. Find a niche market for a product that people had no CLUE that they needed/Wanted and fucking fill that bitch.

I've been going to my local community college, off and on, for 10 YEARS. I have 9 credits. Since my diagnosis earlier this year, however, I am on my way to a career transition and a happier life, and maybe eventually I'll get that associate's degree, too.

Don't measure yourself by your failures, measure yourself by your POTENTIAL. Then do everything you can to meet and even exceed your potential. Got a dream? DO IT! Not happy with today? What are you doing to CHANGE it? Have I ever told you the definition of insanity? Insanity is when people do the same thing every day, over and over again, thinking that things will change. It doesn't matter what you change so long as you never stop changing. It doesn't have to be big things, either. Think of it like this: 10 years from now, you're looking back on your life today. Do you have any regrets about things you didn't do that you really, really wanted to? Well what is stopping you from doing them and what are you doing to change that?

College degrees, high student loan debt, and higher paying jobs are NOT the key to happiness for everyone. Find what makes you truly happy then find some way to milk it for all it's worth. I very, very nearly ended up as a scuba bum in the caribbean because that life sounded SO fucking much nicer than my current one, even though I'm making far more money now than I would as a scuba guy in the caribbean. I stopped and asked myself what was truly important to me, and job happiness/fulfillment were paramount. I didn't end up going that route for many reasons and am now hyperfocused on anything and everything IT related. I hope to have numerous IT certs soon, and with my govt clearance and those certs, I stand to get a (hopefully, highly) rewarding job in the field ASAP.

In all seriousness, take a couple hours and make a coggle (www.coggle.it) about every aspect of your career goals (and goals for all aspects of life in general). I made a HUGE one. I had ""go back to school in earnest"", and police officer, and scuba, and flight school, and IT, and this, that, and the next thing, each with tons of branches about the career path, pay, benefits, the ups and downs and ins and outs of each job. 

For me (and many/most of us ADHD peeps) making it visual like that really drove the point home. I went with scuba as my primary choice, but then decided against it in lieu of flight school and was 100% in full info gathering mode about how to go that route. Then I stepped back and looked at my mental and physical health and ruled both out because they are both 100% dependant on me being 100% healthy. Staking my career on my health sounded like a stupid thing to do at 30 years of age in a career transition. I then landed full force on IT and haven't looked back since. I've been reading, watching videos, taking classes online, taking classes at school, etc etc etc.

TLDR: You've ruined nothing. Everything you are now is the cumulative result of everything you've experienced up to this point. Learn from this experience, build on it, make choices, and make changes. Go be what the fuck you want to be!","cwzp9eb",1,1447479568,"2015-11-14 05:39:28"

I just realized today that I do this as well. Today was the first day in a while that I *really* needed to study, so I kind of paid attention to my behavior. Since I woke up I've walked all over the house multiple times for no reason, taken care of the dog and the cat, helped my dad chopping some firewood and some other chores (which I normally never do), then I had some snacks, made coffee because it ran out, etc. All this just to avoid sitting down and studying I guess lol. Whenever I finally did sit down to study I'd get very uncomfortable and agitated and find something to fix before I could *really* get studying (putting on some music, cleaning my ""work environment"", fixing the lighting, whatever). I even resorted to walking around the house with my laptop to read for a while, because I just couldn't sit down and read. Anyway, now I've had dinner, coffee, prepared everything I could think of and have no other excuses, so when I'm done writing this comment I'll finally just have to sit and study I guess xD

&gt; I'm also the same with writing; I'll read emails, leave them in my inbox to come back to write the response later for. In a way, I have to be like, in the right mood for it. :/ It's weird. I'm weird, but it sounds like you're weird, too. So welcome! *waves*

I do identify with the ""right mood"" thing as well, it's like the stars have to align in just the right way for me to finally do something I've been putting off, and responding to comments on reddit or 
to emails is no different :p

That's quite the score you got on that test lol I might test my parents later as well, that would be very interesting I think, especially my dad, who I strongly suspect might have ADHD as well, since my mom always said I'm just like him in many things, like being super messy, forgetting to clean things up after we use them, forgetting to do things we said we would, not listening to her (poor mom, has to put up with both of us lol), losing things (he literally loses his wallet and keys *at least* once a day, and he's still quite young, so it's not age related, I don't think), etc etc.

About the sleep stuff I still can't say for sure, but I don't notice any problems with the quality of my sleep, it's really mostly me not having the discipline to go to sleep on time and always screwing up and inverting my sleep cycle in the weekends (going to sleep in the morning and waking up in the afternoon). But who knows, maybe below the lack of ""sleep hygiene"" there's also some other sleep related problem I've yet to discover.","f83p0t0",1,1574217194,"2019-11-20 02:33:14"

"7024","Taking a med break during a time when you will need all your mental capabilities and during a potentially stressful situation probably isn't the best time. Routine helps a lot of ADHDers, so stopping your meds and doing something way out of your normal routine isn't the best combo.

If you only need a break for a couple of days, just do it for a weekend were you don't have a lot of work to do. I've heard of people doing that, but I don't know if that was an occasional break or a weekly one.  If you need it to be longer, wait until you have a break from school or a vacation where you don't have a lot of things you're putting at risk. 

It may seem like a good idea to take a break when you plan on doing something super fun and exciting, but losing predictability will make it harder to cope with your freshly unleashed symptoms lol.

"7034","Yeah I agree with you, after all it's the same that happened to me, and I would have never went to a doctor if someone else didn't suggest it in the first place. Just from explaining my story to people - since I got my diagnosis, a lot of friend and their dog now think they have ADHD. (I'm not saying there's no chance that they don't)

I think with the internet, phones and all, it's just very easy to want something we can blame on why we can't achieve what people expect from us. Why we are on on facebook so often; or why we rather watch 10 more YouTube videos instead of doing our homework, and so on. We live in a time where most things are made to achieve as much brain stimulation as possible. Having something to blame gives us closure, and something so broad like ADHD is just very easy to identify with. 

Then on the other hand, I'm a big believer of having things like medication available to everyone. If you think you can't concentrate or manage your life, but taking pill X in the morning with your coffee and suddenly you turn into a productive bee and live happier, then by all means, go for it - ADHD or not. I think the key is to observe and understand and try to see things from different perspectives instead of running to the easy answer.

"7051","Fuck... I feel that your life parallels mine in so many ways. I feel I'm hitting this right now, but I'm coming out of it a bit. Buddy, I wish I could say there's an easy way to go about this, but as you know, life with ADHD is hard. People like you, me, and everyone else suffering with ADHD may already realize the unattractive and unfair answer. We have to work harder. And I don't mean the, ""You're not trying hard enough! This is your fault!"" attitude way of saying work harder. I mean surviving in the way people like us had to from the beginning. An enormous, almost overbearing ability to persevere is the reason why I can match my peers without ADHD. If something takes me 8 hours to do, you can bet everyone else was done in 4-6. This is a curse at first, but I think this extra time, even if much of it is distracted, counts in the long run. My belief is that it makes you and I stronger, more familiar, more practiced, etc. at the given task, such that the learning curve, while slow at first, is eventually extremely adept at climbing quickly and mastery is much simpler for us.

It took me 3 months to write my resume for a single job. I hated doing it, it was tedious at best and heartbreakingly discouraging at it worst. I thought it would never be finish, and I nearly quit multiple times. Once I was finished however, I knew everything I needed to know regarding resumes, formatting for different work environments, wording, aesthetic, and more. I knock them out quicker and quicker, becoming better and better with each one. And this feeling of success reminds me of what I wish I could never forget. That I am worth something. I can do things. Those statements might sound like bleeding heart bullshit platitudes to someone not in the know, and they kinda are haha but they're the thoughts I don't have when I'm afraid of my ADHD and the thoughts that make me feel powerful when i do. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, things are not ideal, but they're not as bleak as you feel they are. Claim your successes and put little thought on the mini ADHD hiccups along the way. As for direction, I say do it. Get the degree. You know how gifted and sought after you'd be in a field like physics? You're help would be invaluable. You have strengths where others don't in a field that require critical thinking. It's practically a sure thing to say that if you can find the passion within yourself, you'll be unstoppable. 

Now to address the part you don't want to hear. Yeah, you'll be going back to college, doing every little fuckin class assignment you have to to get your transfer credits, then transfer and get your graduation credits. That's a steep mountain to climb, but it's not a cliff. Even if it was, cliffs are scalable. 

If you decide to get your degree, you'll be happier in the end. It's not fair that you should have to try harder to be where you need to be, but it's not the worst either. It comes with benefits. My advice is, push through everything. Bulldoze your way to success. Put in the extra man hours we ADHD sufferers have to, because the endgame here is putting you in control. It's not always fun, but you know your worth, and you're more than worth the effort from yourself to be the best you can be.","cyunvsh",6,1452556416,"2016-01-11 23:53:36"

What might help is scheduling a meeting with the boss to ask if she has any suggestions on how you can develop in the office.  At a private meeting she may respond a little differently than in front of a group.  If you want any special training or workshops that would be the time to ask - but be sure to have supporting info that shows how what you learn can help her team, and try to never ask for favors like that in front of a group - ever.  Think of this as finding a way to help her team - that should be her biggest concern. If you can focus on that it will help you take some of this a little less personally.  You can't help that there are favorites and you can't help being the last one in but you can do your work, be reliable and positive and eventually get more acceptance. Also, if you can present your own status report to the boss on a somewhat regular basis - even if it's just dropping on her in her office and saying you've been working on X and it's really interesting (or whatever, keeping it positive and even compliment the 'favorite' when appropriate) that could result in her taking what you say into account if she's been getting different messages that cause you to be blamed for other issues.","c6febgi",1,1348977303,"2012-09-30 03:55:03"

"7091","TL;DR I'm a Mexican-American female, currently in-progress with a diagnosis at 24yo, so I don't know the black+adhd experience, but here's mine:

Growing up I was technically a good student. Got decent grades, retained a lot from lecture, but I rarely ever put effort into it. I was messy and disorganized. Especially compared to the other students in my honors/AP classes, the majority of whom were Asian (the whole school was evenly mixed between Asian/PI, Hispanic/Latino, and Black/African-American).

I had mostly Caucasian teachers in high school and all the teachers who gave me well-meant talks about getting my shit together were white, so I think I definitely internalized some Stereotype Threat without that ever being their intention.

At community college though, most of my professors were women of color, and they were brilliant, professional, organized, and inspiring. When I floundered towards the end of my time there, I think the stereotype threat was mostly gone and I had internalized the frustration and shame to be directed at myself only.

Even now that I'm getting treatment, it's still a hard feeling to shake off.","d7grux9",4,1473499293,"2016-09-10 09:21:33"

You can combat this by taking melatonin yourself. There are pills from anywhere between 0,1 mg and 5 mg. I personally take 5 mg every evening just before I go to bed and it works miracles. You may want to try different dosages to see what works for you.

Melatonin is over the counter and doesn't really have any side effects, though some people don't sleep well on it.","elwv6t5",1,1556375167,"2019-04-27 14:26:07"

And my husband couldn't stand me because i was so ""messy' and all. 

Luckily my kid is pretty easy and precocious. Infant years were godawful. Tedious beyond belief. Now that he's older, we can talk and play and i can reason with him to some degree, and it's much easier. But of course, right now he is in the other room screaming BLOODY MURDER because he doesn't nap at daycare (which is SO EXPENSIVE, thank goodness i get daycare assistance) and is a complete mess all evening (when well rested he's a dream kid). Bit hard to study for my midterm, or do homework.

My house is messy, i try to own as little amount of stuff as possible to help. Sometimes if i'm really tired and take my meds i get really ragey. Traumatized my kid because of it the other day. I'm super afraid of that happening again. :(

make sure you have a support system and can afford exorbitant daycare costs, and BABYSITTERS. It's extra important to get some alone time as an ADDer so you don't snap. But overall, it's good.

The problem is that a lot of students leave their work until the last minute, thinking they'll have enough time to complete it, but completely underestimating how long it'll actually take to do well. You can't know how long it'll take to do that assignment because you haven't done it before. Rushed or incomplete work may be work that lacks proper citations, has lots of spelling errors, or doesn't flow well. It's *rushed*. 

Your cover letter story could have ended in disaster if it took you longer than an hour to write either one. Random shit happens and you should always expect to be delayed, and factor that potential delay into your schedule. Leaving things with no wiggle room **will** end in disaster.

My bank account and credit were a good reflection of my impulsivity and employment instability.

Now, 6 years later, I‚Äôm successful as a  freelance translator (the field I studied in), my financial situation is quite stable and getting better every year. I have a great relationship with my parents. My friendships are solid, and I have known most of my friends for at least 10 years. They‚Äôre all the kind of friends who would drop everything to come support you when in need (and I would do the same for them). And I married my fantastic husband last September.

I am happy. Really, truly happy. And that is success for me. I don‚Äôt lead a glamorous life filled with riches and all that jazz, but that was never what I wanted.

Yes, there are struggles. Yes, I have to work harder than others sometimes. But everybody struggles sometimes, neurotypical or not.

Now, I have the life I dreamt of before medication.  It‚Äôs a ‚Äúsimple life‚Äù filled by a mentally stimulated job, financial stability, a great partner, and fantastic friendship... plus the free time and money needed to take a surf trip or two every year.

Throughout University I was known for classic ADHD behaviours, so being easily distracted, leaving things untill the last minute etc, I scraped by and got a very good degree classification (2.1 in MEng General Engineering, I'm from the UK), this was without medication, or diagnosis. I was lucky to have a good support network and did well in the project work. 

Then I got a job in investment management and wanted to take a professional qualification to further my career, so started studying again, I took longer than my colleagues to finish studying for the exam, but still passed first time. This was again without medication. 

A year later I was taking the second part of the qualification, I had been diagnosed and was medicated so studying came a lot more naturally. However I failed the exam. I'm putting this down to stress and anxeity regarding my living situation as during the week before my ex best friend gave me two weeks notice that she wanted out of our flatshare, and I had to find a new tenant or move out. 

What I'm trying to get at here is that there is a chance getting stuff done might come a little easier with medication etc, but it doesn't guarantee success.

Cocoa does contain a small amount of caffeine, but you would have to consume an awful lot of chocolate to get a significant amount since a lot of people find chocolate comforting rather than stimulating.

to those who don't know what OneNote is, think of it as a multi-subject notebook. except you can have as many subjects as you want. and write whatever you want in it, however you want. and OCR everything to find it with a super quick search. pictures, documents, recipes, anything and everything.

i don't use OneNote anymore these days despite it being an awesome utility (i was in fact ecstatic when i discovered microsoft was making it available on iOS and android devices). google Keep became a thing long before OneNote became available to me on-the-go. Within the last year or so I tried re-incorporating new notebooks into my life with OneNote but haven't been successful, out of school I just haven't found how it fits when other tools/apps already fulfill all of my needs.

recipe management? Paprika, check. syncs between devices. 
note-taking on the go? Keep, check. also syncs.
project management and collaboration? you guessed it. google stepped up to meet my needs and goals on any device at anytime before microsoft could get it going.

In the previous years, they came up with a system to inform the professors when they have STARs (students at risk) in their classes. Of course, we're given the option whether to disclose the condition or not. They even have the option to provide medical and/or therapy subsidy.

This is extremely helpful for me. I've had to keep incompletes a lot and need more time to work on things or absorb them. Likewise, I'm given the option by some professors to change the requirement. For instance, I can be bad at oral exams and on-the-spot exams but I'm good at writing papers. So they allow me to do that instead (it can be more difficult since I have to write about 5 pages or so instead of being done with things in 1 hr but for me that's better because I can take my time and still learn anyway).

I'm on my way to finishing my second degree and if I didn't have any institutional support, I doubt that I would've made it.

I think the one that hurt the most though was when I was having an appraisal with my boss and he said ""other people are saying you don't give a shit about your job"" which really wasn't true at all.  Okay, fine, I'm late every day, but I also stayed late every day, if I really didn't give a shit about my job surely I'd be gone at 5pm on the dot every day.

"7194","Your English is pretty good, and it's easy to understand you. Here are some word choices that sound more natural to my native ear.

&gt; I have a few other lives in my mind that I revisit ~~where~~ **when** I'm in my bed,

You do your imagining while you are positioned in your bed, but the lives you imagine do not happen in your bed. Here you would use ""when"" to describe that you do this *during* your time in bed, but that your fantasies are not about being *in* bed.

&gt; ~~on~~ **in** one of them,

It sounds more natural to my ear to think of a fantasy as something things happen inside of, rather than on top of.

&gt; I imagine how my life would be like ~~a~~ as royalty in **the** Victorian era

We say ""a royal"" or ""royalty"" but not ""a royalty"". Also, you need ""as"" in there.

&gt; some days I fall asleep before I finish something and I ~~retake~~ resume it the next night.

""Retake"" is used to describe things you take again, like a test, or a pill. I don't usually hear it used otherwise. ""Resume"" means continue, like you start where you stopped last time, like starting a book where you bookmarked the page, or continuing a tv show.","f8rkymh",1,1574743364,"2019-11-26 04:42:44"

"7206","It seems to be pretty common even in the more severe cases, myself included, most I can really say is you get used to it. Have you asked any of the people around you if they sometimes feel the same way?

It's something of a complex issue, this might be an ADHD thing because it only affects certain parts of our cognition or if it's all mental impairment but it seems we don't feel mentally impaired like a physical impairment. There aren't any nerves screaming at you that something is wrong or off, no sensory data to alert the issue. I don't feel like I'm unmotivated or incapable of something, I just find that I am. It might be clearer with those that have found success with medication, that they have a new perspective of what ""normal"" is to compare their unmedicated state to. But if our cognition is the only thing you have to compare our minds can't seem to see the fault within itself, there's no built-in template to reference from.

That's what always seems to be worst about ADHD when you have it and aren't diagnosed. The stress of not being able to keep up with your peers creates this screaming frustration, but nothing feels wrong internally, well except the ever whelming up anxiety and depression. According to all your senses, you should be perfectly fit and capable yet this choking atmosphere, some invisible force prevents your body moving the way you want it to. You just don't know why this is happening.

We are built and raised to think by default we are in control, that we are conscious beings with conscious actions. So it's so easy to internalize that this is a conscious decision we are making, that we are choosing to be lazy or act out, that these times when we are at odds with ourselves are from a personality defect. And it is only reinforced by those around us that don't know any better than we do that an impairment is at play. They see you acting in an inappropriate manner, they know from experience you should be about to control your behavior. After all, you're a smart kid most children your age are able to sit still and pay attention you must be lazy or disobedient, you just don't care, do you? How has your mother been raising you she must be a bad parent.

Yes.

I called my doctor in tears after the end of a long-term relationship exacerbated by my ADHD, told him that I couldn't go on with the rest of my life like this and begged him to refer me to a psychiatrist for treatment.

It took a while to get a referral (and it helped that I had been diagnosed as a child), and at the first appointment the psychiatrist gave me away a long questionnaire to fill in with various symptoms and how they had impacted upon me as a child and an adult.

Well, she wants your attention that's a given. Part of my ADD is wanting to say things out loud and it resulted in me texting those bad feelings to anyone, who'd listen and especially my ex. To be honest, you just have to confront her about this, because even if she gets help and gets better, it might not affect those texting habits because they indeed are a habit. You have to tell her that you respect her and want to support her, but the negativity is very difficult on you. After I got off the birth control I pretty quickly got better but the negativity stayed and I've had my new boyfriend tell me that it's a bit annoying how much I complain. And I think it's fair he said that and it made me realize that I was bringing unnecessary strain on the relationship. Be empathic for sure, but I don't think she's actually asking for an opinion on those situtations she describes to you, but rather support and understanding. But you really have to confront her about how you feel, because how else will she know.

"7267","I know where you're coming from. I was the same kind of kid - all the answers came easy, when I was willing to do the work - and I couldn't finish anything. I struggled through college, got top marks, and eventually struggled through a PhD at a top state university. The whole time, telling myself I'm lazy, not being able to finish stuff, procrastinating. I became depressed and obsessive.

Fast forward 15 more years with lots of collateral damage, I got diagnosed at 45 years old. Since then, all four of my kids have been diagnosed too. Two take medication.

I was also afraid of diagnosis - I felt like it would mean that there's something wrong with me, with my mind and how I think. But when it happened - it's actually quite liberating. It explains what's going on, and helped me realize that there are lots of people out there who are struggling with the same issues I am struggling with.

We ADHDers think a little differently from everyone else. Most of us were taught that this makes us inferior, that we are stupid or lazy, but that's not true. Non ADHD'ers are obsessed with schedules, and tests, and organization and stuff. They like to set goals and stuff. We have different strengths that non-ADHDers don't understand.

Your doctor said no, he didn't think it was a possibility, or your doctor actually tested you and that's why he doesn't think you have ADHD? If it's the former, and not the latter, I highly suggest seeing a new doctor and tell him or her everything you've outlined in this post. Adults diagnosed with ADHD have a higher than normal likelihood of being diagnosed with depression and anxiety. If you have ADHD, simply treating depression without treating its cause isn't terribly helpful. See if you can seek out a specialist that treats ADHD in adults.

I also would look around during classes (university) and notice that I was one of the only people constantly playing with something in my hands, checking my phone, etc. I actually played relatively mindless games on my phone often because I thought they helped me listen better.

The friend who noticed my conversation bouncing mentioned another friend who did something similar that had ADHD, so I delved wholesale into researching the condition (hyperfocus and whatnot). It also lined up with some different experiences in high school, hanging out with friends and I'd say something that they found hilarious but also went ""WTF where'd that come from???"" and joke about ""do you have ADD or something???""

Well, turns out they were right.

I've been on medication just over a year. I find that I stick to difficult tasks to get them done instead of just quitting, generally am more amiable to people, and more dedicated to things that need to get done (i.e. laundry).

  I stuck with it, but not practicing much so I made very little progress. I didn't get any better until I was playing music that I actually enjoyed, so I actually wanted to play. Now playing the piano is one of the things I get distracted with when I'm supposed to be doing more important things. 

  My advice would be to choose one instrument, and play pieces you really want to learn. There will be a bit of a learning curve and you'll feel a bit shit, but it gets much easier with time. Of course you need to actually practice first. Having a teacher and having regular lessons is really helpful, as is working towards a goal.

The inflammation may be in a low phase that you do not even recognize the pain but trust me it is still there your brain is just doing it's best to ignore it, but your body is still taking actions to conserve energy and thus the brain fog.  Also understand that your brain is taking actions on blocking that pain and thus those resources are being partially used and thus you are less able to focus and you may have other cognition symptoms.

It‚Äôs really weird that we came up with very very similar processes, but I‚Äôve explained it to other people before and they always look at me like I‚Äôm crazy. I‚Äôve never talked to anyone that does anything like this. Usually they‚Äôll say something along the lines of ‚ÄúI just write it,‚Äù which is just as crazy to me.

"7364","That is such bullshit. ""Derp herp you don't have ADHD that's a dumb people disease.""
I developed anxiety and depression and became suicidal because I was struggling so hard to keep up, since I set really high expectations for myself and everyone was always driving me crazy with that ""potential"" shit. I was able to bullshit my way through school up until sophomore year, and even still when I noticed something was up my parents just told me it was because I'm lazy and entitled, and ADHD is rare anyway, and it's mostly boys who have it and I'm just too focused on my crushes at school. Hey did you know that the current DSM says that girls cannot ever possibly have ADHD because it is boys only and is no-girls allowed to the ADHD club because it's only because of their hormones and lady parts and it's really just depression because they're so moody since, you know, emotions are for girls? Yeah no I didn't either but apparently my parents were expert psychiatrists. 
My therapist and psychiatrist finally talked some sense into them (both of them had really incredulous looks when my parents told them about how I've always been as kid, I think they were shocked that I hadn't been screened for any sort of disorder before). My parents tried to justify it by saying that I'm smart and therefore can't possibly have a mental illness because mental illness automatically = IQ of 70 and below and consistent failing grades. 

But yeah it sucks. My first therapist was like that too, she tried convincing me it was all a matter of motivation and that I wasn't trying hard enough. Not in therapy anymore but my school has really awesome disability services counsellors, I met with one today and she was really understanding and helpful of what I struggle with and what I need.

"7370","That‚Äôs completely understandable. I‚Äôve had talks with some of my friends who have had a bad first experience with a therapist, be it for depression, ADHD or other problems, and the first experience is always important. If your first experience was bad, you‚Äôll think all therapists work the same and therefore do not work for you at all. 

The reality of it is a lot more like making friends at work or in school: you need to have a good click. There are people you are not friends with and never will be. Not a good reason for that specifically, you just don‚Äôt connect with them like that. You‚Äôre not going to have deep conversations with those people either. Therapists are still just people, who you either click with, or don‚Äôt. And if you don‚Äôt, and you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre being taken seriously and you don‚Äôt feel secure enough to share your feelings and thoughts with that person, that person as a therapist is not going to help you. And it‚Äôs best to acknowledge and mention as soon as you can, so that a different person can be found. 

A therapist can only work for you if you acknowledge the problem you seek help for yourself (an alcoholist who doesn‚Äôt see it‚Äôs substance use as a problem will not change it‚Äôs behavior in rehab; it will only act such that he is released the soonest), can be open about your honest thoughts and issues and wish to seek a solution to the problem yourself and accept the assistance of the other. If you fail to meet any of these four points, therapy will fail. If you are lying or staying on the surface with your therapist, you‚Äôre not going to feel any better. If you do not wish to find solutions or do not acknowledge the problem (when you are for example sent to the therapist by someone else without your consent), therapy is not going to help. 

So if you already feel like this is leading to nothing, stop. Find a different therapist. Don‚Äôt let that defaitist mentality get to you, since you can be helped with your troubles! It just takes the right person for you to do so.","fz10vfz",3,1595542697,"2020-07-23 22:18:17"

"7394","I wondered about this, since I've been offered stimulants w/o need for assessment before. (Didn't take the doc up on the offer, because I feel like I have my life under control.) And a friend who recently DID want to try them got a prescription in like... 35 seconds. 

Because, if you're ADHD enough? The doctors WANT to medicate you. They don't even send you to a psychiatrist! (OTOH, the people I know who HAVE been sent on weren't 'faking'.... they were misdiagnosing themselves and actually had much more complicated conditions... as evidenced by the fact that their 'ADHD' was sudden onset, etc.)

A lot of people seem to think that adult ADHD can come from nowhere. Or, that if school is suddenly hard for you, it must be ADHD. (In reality, most people, ADHD or not, will eventually encounter something that's too hard for them. Where and when sort of depends on your previous education and your IQ, and drugs can't fix either of those for you.)

Anyway, I think that in addition to 'fakers,' there are a lot of people who never learned that you CAN'T do everything you want to do. Loving astronomy doesn't mean that you have the ability to get a PhD in astrophysics. Liking computers doesn't mean that you'd be a good EE, etc.....  And there's no drug that conquers unrealistic expectations.  And no doctor is going to say ""Hey, maybe you're just not smart enough for this school/major/career path.""

Last night I found myself playing path of exile or washing the dishes or completely immersed in star trek at different 'dings' instead of studying, and was able to refocus. It also helped keep me from losing track of time taking a test.

The running to-do list is everything! At the top I have any appointments I need to keep, then a table with my top 3 tasks, followed by a prioritized list of assignments for the week with the due date and course indicator.

"7403","So I took myself off the meds for a plethora of negative side effects, one being serious electrical pathway issues with my heart. So I literally can‚Äôt be on the meds. But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise,because I just had to deal with it, there was no alternative. 
The biggest thing for me is learning from my mistakes in the moment and doing everything in my power to not let it happen again. I do this mainly via journaling. It really helps slow me down and break the problem down. 
On top of that I am pretty big about writing down my goals. In whatever way/style works best for you. From there I post that in public places in my apartment where my wife and I can see them everyday. She doesn‚Äôt really do anything at all with them, however if I really start to slip she‚Äôll call me out and be like ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you want to start doing X and Y more?‚Äù 
Finally, I have a padfolio I dropped a shit ton of money on, that I didn‚Äôt have. The main reason being if I feel good and look good, I‚Äôll perform better. Kind of a way of tricking my brain into caring about mundane things. Also when you spend $400 on a handmade leather padfolio, well god dammit you‚Äôre going to use it. In it I‚Äôll take any and all note and keep two pens. One black and one blue. When I write a task on my
Todo list I create a little box, and when I‚Äôm done I get the satisfaction of coloring that box in blue so perfectly. I also use the OHIO method. Only handle it once. So when something pops up, I just do it right then and there. That‚Äôs the thing about action, it has a weird momentum property to it. Once you do one thing, the second is exponentially easier. 
Actually finally, I use my iPhone like my life depends on it. I mean it‚Äôs in my hand all the time, might as well make good use of it. I put literally everything in my calendar, obviously with alerts. You don‚Äôt even needs to put it in yourself, Siri will do it for you. I also keep my iPhone clutter and time wasting free. So I have no games, no social media, only the bare essentials or things that add to my work/success productivity. 
None of this is fool proof though. Definitely have those weeks(like when APeX came out) where everything just crumbled. But, I had so many tripwires and failsafes built in, and I had developed such strong habits, that I actually started drifting back towards them. Which was a really cool moment for me.

On the other hand, every time I've ever seen an NT use ADHD meds, they go into this almost trance-like state of hyper-focus, and get kinda pissed off when you disrupt them.

"7425","Are you on the meds at home? Usually doses wear off by end of day so a work day you'd be spending time at home unmedicated. So if you're not dosing on weekends you're not really medicated at home...

If you are medicated at home... it might help to try to find out what is putting you into a loop. Is it an attempt to be ""responsible"" that is derailing you? Maybe give yourself permission to be irresponsible on Saturday and be responsible on Sunday. Is it chores? Maybe see about hiring someone to help with that (it may be more affordable than you think). 

Basically my advice is to try to alleviate some of the stress you are clearly feeling in the home.

And yeah a different med may help with weekends/evenings. Like long release stuff has less ""rebound"" as it wears off for many people, for example, so it might make your evenings more pleasant. Even long release ritialin is rather short, and a lot of people feel worse than baseline right after it wears.

And dexedrine/adderall both help release more dopamine into your brain (vs just blocking your brain from recycling it like ritalin) so if you're severely dopamine deficient it might help elevate your mood in addition to providing focus (I found ritalin good for focus but it did nothing for my mood).","edpskxj",1,1547134324,"2019-01-10 15:32:04"

Check this graph from last october: I started meds on the 19th, which coincided with an increase in productivity (professional email, cad-software, ms office)  - but also an increase in ""very distractive"" activities.. (reddit, facebook and mostly time-wasting websites etc..).

[October productivity](http://i.imgur.com/TGgDy.png)

After a few weeks - I started to focus on the right things, check the graph from november:

Whether one is the pomodoro method or a 5-hour energy drink, just try them and find a few that work.  

In your toughest hours being unmotivated you could trigger one of those to just keep mustering on...for me making myself accountable to my wife and kids was a big factor, along with my medicine, an energy tablet for late nights, and just walking every few hours for 10 minutes or so.

That said, I honestly can't envision a scenario where you successfully petition your school to ""reset"" your GPA. As some other users mentioned it might be possible to get a medical withdrawal for certain semesters, but those credits would be gone and you would simply have to retake those classes (assuming they were necessary for graduation in the first place). I highly doubt you would be able to just have failed courses struck from your record while retaining 2.0+ grades. You should definitely meet with your school counseling center (if you have one) and the dean of students (or similar administrator) to find out what options are available to you regarding your transcript in light of your diagnosis, but I think the best course of action is to continue to do well in your classes and graduate. In every graduate school application I have ever filled out that specified a 3.0 GPA cutoff for applicants, there was ALWAYS a section asking applicants with sub 3.0 GPAs to explain their situations.

Please find a way to report her, she would honestly kill someone with her ""medical"" knowledge. 

I have bi polar depression, PTSD. Anxiety, also ADHD-I. But none of it requires cream of the crop drugs. 

I was on lamictal (sp) but I had to be pulled for it bc of some insane reactions. I got up and drove over an hr to work, through an entire deer infested county in the dark with no memory of driving. That was a little freaky, it got worse bc I would have these urges to veer my truck off the road just to wreck it so I didnt have to go to work. Yeah, my old psych doc yanked that pretty quick. 

I finally found a decent combination it's a little unorthodox it's visarel, lexapro, and phentermine. The phentermine is prescribed by my endocrinologist to help manage my weight. My psych doc piggybacked off that doing the visarel to bring my anxiety which manifests as rage, and lexapro for depression. I'm doing well with this combo, for 6 months. I do have to pay out of pocket for the phentermine but my other ones are covered

"7545","Sorry about the convo. Your boss did a lot wrong, but you should also review how you contributed to putting him into a situation that s/he handled badly.   
1. don't tell people you have ADHD. Tell them about individual symptoms: Colleagues: ""I naturally talk to loud and don't notice. Sorry about that. Please just tell me when I am disturbing you and I will shut up. ""To boss: ""I am not naturally an organised person. But I am acquiring the skills to become more organised. One tool would be if once a week I tell you what's on my to-do list for the next week. You can then see if I am missing anything important.

2. Really? You want to be an accountant? With ADHD? In accounting in general, you have to be really well organised. So either find a role where you can use your ""hyper focus"", or find a role high enough where you can delegate routine work, or look for a career path that won't make your ADHD issues front and center of your job.

"7556","Several reasons that ADHD looks like it's caused by poor parenting.

1. ADHD and other disorders don't respond well to what most people consider typical/normal parenting techniques, ie, the idea most people have of ""good parenting"". Typical behaviour management just makes ADHD, aspergers, etc, appear worse because the cause of the behaviour isn't choice, it's anxiety or lack of development of the brain. Hence, parents will find that what works for their child is unconventional. Bystanders don't see the adverse effects of ""typical"" parenting on that kid, they just see a kid behaving in a way they consider bad and a parent responding in an unconventional way and put two and two together and make five. Actually, parents who find unconventional things which work are far from bad parents, they are very good parents.

2. The definition of ""works"" isn't what people consider working. The idea people have about parenting is that if a kid misbehaves, the parents should do something which immediately stops the behaviour. Mitigating it to a safe level is often, with ADHD or other neurological disorders, extremely difficult and a complete win for the parent. Actually stopping the behaviour in its tracks is usually impossible. If you can reduce the behaviour to a safe level, that's great, but it's really unlikely that you're going to get it to a totally socially acceptable level. But bystanders just see a parent ""letting their kid get away with it"" and assume that they are failing to control their child's bad behaviour, rather than the actual situation which is that they are safely managing their child's difficulties.

3. Parents of kids with ADHD aren't perfect. It's a platitude that ""God gives special children to special parents"". There are no extra skills or talents that you magically pick up because your child has special needs. Just as parents of neurotypical children sometimes get things wrong, so do parents of ADHD children. Just as parents of neurotypical children can be good or bad parents, so can ADHD parents. Bad parenting isn't helpful for ADHD management, but it doesn't cause it. While parents of neurotypical kids are ""allowed"" bad days, witnessing a bad day for a parent with a neurodiverse kid seems to be taken as carte blanche proof that the child's disability is the parent's fault. It just doesn't work that way.

4. Lastly an important distinction: ADHD in particular is *highly* heritable. ADHD in adults can cause problems with parenting including but not limited to:- trouble with organisation, follow through and consistency, a tendency to blow up and lash out easily, distractability from what their child is doing. These problems can create significant challenges for parenting. The fact that you see a correlation between parenting issues such as these and ADHD is not because this style of parenting causes ADHD, but because parents of children with ADHD often have ADHD themselves and so find parenting consistently harder than Neurotypical parents. There may be a mild causal effect in that inconsistent parenting can make ADHD appear worse. But children who are adopted into non ADHD families still display symptoms of ADHD if they have it, and still need careful management.","cz9zcsr",31,1453643474,"2016-01-24 13:51:14"

"7573","The idea is that we know what we need to do, but when we start to do it, or want to start to do it, or think maybe it would be a good idea if we do it, this intention slips the mind either through a distraction, a change, or getting tired from the effort to hold the intention and we do something else. 

This is why externalizing structure, memory, goals and intentions is really helpful for ADHD. It is also one of the reason meditation can be helpful because one of things you do is practice coming back to an intention (feeling the breath, or saying a mantra etc) over and over and over again. 

""Information deficit,"" is just ignorance. You just don't know what you are supposed to do or what the goal is. That is usually easily remedied by research and education.  ","dldnh9c",6,1502287908,"2017-08-09 14:11:48"

I do wanna say to you though, please be careful. Be mindful of yourself, as well as your limits as a human being. Follow your doctor's instructions. Learn how the medication makes you feel over time, and talk with your doctor about it. Be honest with yourself, and with your doctor.

Also, based upon how productive it sounds like your day's been, I'm willing to guess that your appetite is probably less noticeable than usual; you still need to eat nutritious food. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU'RE EATING WELL EVERYDAY. Similarly, you may feel more awake/restless at night. Or you may feel super motivated to tackle a big project (or multiple projects) in a single day/night. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU'RE SLEEPING WELL EVERY NIGHT.

"7578","Hey Sasquatch, I've taken some time to respond because I wanted to consider the best way to respond to this. I think that you misunderstand what passion is. Yes, it is loving something so much that you devote all your time to it, but it is also reveling in the journey. Yes, there will be times that you don't want to spend any time on it, i.e. going to work or school. But then there are times that you have great joy at accomplishing something along that journey.
 
The way I see it is like two video games. Let's take for example Dragon Age inquisition, I never finished that game. I lost interest I wasn't passionate about the story or the accomplishments that took me through that game it felt like a chore. Disclaimer, some people loved I  didn't, this is just an example. But the Witcher 3 was amazing every time I accomplished something I felt like I was doing something or advancing. I loved the journey of beating that game. Why am I saying all of this? Well some of that journey sucked. I really didn't like doing all the swimming and boating I did to get all the treasure chests in the Isles it was so boring and I wanted to give up. I did all the swimming and boating anyways because there could have been a map to a better armour piece or recipe for a better potion, sometimes there was. I was never short of gold after that. The best parts of the game outweighed the dull, boring parts, and all that gold was totally worth it. 

What I'm trying to say is that you need to find something that will ignite your imagination. Something that even though some of it is mundane, the rewards are great enough that you will stick with the mundane. For me I love learning and I'm pretty creative. I've found a job in which you never, ever arrive there is always something to learn and different ways to be creative. There is always a challenge waiting around the corner. Yes, there are absolutely boring days and dull times, but the rewards are enough that I'm absolutely ok with sticking those out. 

Finally, something ADHDers are horrible at, me included, is self discipline. I am so bad that my wife is constantly helping me by reminding me to do chores, and not spending money, poor woman. I'm mostly getting better but there are times, let me tell you. Passion requires self discipline sometimes. For us it's not easy we forget the rewards, and we don't see the forest for the trees. I envy normal people I wish self discipline was easy but it isn't, for us especially. We have to work, and work, and work at it. I really hope this helps and you find a passion that is super rewarding. Good luck!!!!","e8j6208",2,1540614737,"2018-10-27 04:32:17"

"7598","Yea, it's normal for two reasons: 1. ADHD makes you impatient. So, often times I would say ""yes, got it."" to someone, and I would realize one minute after having said it that I had no idea what I just agreed to. I used to be really impulsive and would answer without much forethought, so I've had to train myself to not quickly answer, just to be done with whatever didn't have my interest at the moment. It's not personal to you as a gf, like it wasn't to mine, but my brain is just hardwired to be attracted to bright, shiny objects--bright and shiny being metaphors, of course. 2. My forgetfulness was directly related to my propensity to answer quickly. If I didn't write something down, I would not do it/remember it. Most times, I would get by and remember what I needed to, but I was my memory, and thus my followthrough, was inconsistent at best--and unreliable at my worst. It's a harsh thing to admit/say, but being honest with myself about my limitations, and then building the desire to change them, has helped in ensuring that I don't miss deadlines/appointments or disappoint people. That being said, it's a daily struggle because there is alot of information in the world and ample opportunity for my ADHD to kick in and let me carelessly agree to something that I will forget, even on meds. PS. Forgive the guy and let him know that you notice these limitations. He needs help dealing with them, and hopefully he is a good enough guy to recognize that and do something about it. PPS. Kudos to you for taking it upon yourself to do the research and try to be understanding. The guy clearly has a gem, and as someone with a very supportive and loving partner, I know that having someone like that in your corner is rare yet crucial to not letting ADHD stand in the way of your happiness. 
TL;DR: It's normal, forgive him. Tell him his forgetfulness concerns you, and you both need to come up with a system to make up for the bad memory.","cn2f3th",1,1419274454,"2014-12-22 18:54:14"

I have 2 tips for you: 
1. Keep a protein with ultra fine oats shake next to your bed, use fat milk and a thermos flask, this will keep the milk cool for 8-10 hours and preserve nice taste.
2. Regarding sleep issues, ask your doc for guanfacine/intuniv: Its an adhd med, originally a blood pressure medication which works as well as the other adhd meds, if you combine guanfacine with another ADHD med such as strattera you achieve even better results then standalone treatment. The one annoying side effect is that it makes you tired and sleepy.

"7638","I've had a wildly unhealthy relationship with food since I was young--anorexia, then in recovery swung too far into binge eating (probably worsened by using weed to self-medicate, honestly), then went back to being underweight when I started adderall. I think about food ALL the time. If I'm not fixating on planning out exactly what I eat with proper nutrition and everything, I'm mindlessly shoving food in my mouth because I was craving ice cream and have poor impulse control. Cravings have a tendency to derail my plan for food the entire day, because I can't stop eating whatever I'm craving until it's gone. I also work at a grocery store which probably isn't great for my mental health.

I'm not sure if this is a long-term thing that will help but I've been changing up my eating habits the last few weeks and I'm having success with a couple things (YMMV). One, keep less food in the house. I basically have whatever I've planned for food for the week plus a FEW pantry items/baking or cooking staples. Two, have a strict food budget--I use a different debit card and put part of my paycheck into that account. This has actually really helped me because I'm very financially insecure, so I had been buying food only AFTER bills are paid and the lack of consistent food in the house made me more likely to binge. But if I focus on my health being one of the most important ""bills"" to pay, I've set aside that money and I worry about it less. Three, I've started eating more healthy-ish fats like nuts (trail mix) or hummus as snacks and it seems to keep me full longer and less likely to crave food than getting a snickers or something. Obviously you know all the normal stop eating processed foods, eat vegetables, etc things that everyone says but really, seriously, the more I eat food I cook myself with healthy ingredients, fast food really isn't appealing anymore. I just had some fries from McDonald's and they were so bland and tasteless I thought something was wrong with them. Nope! I've just been eating more appealing food lately so it's not good in comparison.

I hope some of that was vaguely helpful! I wrote way more than I intended to, sorry about that. I still fixate on food a lot even if I've cut down a bit on the impulsive emotional eating","em2orn2",5,1556560621,"2019-04-29 17:57:01"

It may seem harsh but you may say you can't afford to pay his tuition if he won't put in the effort to learn and feel accomplished by putting in effort. This may be hard for him, but you also don't have to be strict or harsh about it.

I was struggling getting good grades in undergrad while my parents were still helping pay for a lot. My mom said if I didn't start getting better grades I would either have to move home and do community college, or they won't be able to keep helping pay.

It scared the living crap out of me. I tried but still didn't do great, and I felt like shit when I told my mom my grades. She could see how defeated I felt so rather than following through with a punishment/consequence she said it was okay, that I put in the effort and that's all she would ask.  For me thinking I had failed only to be forgiven helped me focus.
Unfortunately for me I went down a similar road as your husband and it drove away my girlfriend of almost 3 years, which only added to my depression.

In my case, it's when someone will still be there even when you make it tough for them to be supportive. It's knowing no matter how mad I make someone or how foolish I act at times, they won't give up on me.
The break up, though I can understand why, has made me feel as though I am not even worthy of love and I don't know if I can handle that.

I'm not your husband, and I can't say what will work for him, but for me it was thinking I made a huge mistake and being forgiven, and I feel like having someone be patient and struggle through the process with me would help.
I got help initially for study strategies, but the depression was to apparent. I was afraid I'd become someone else and I didn't like who that person might be so I am getting help. It feels just as hopeless as anything else but someone as supportive as you would be a huge help. He just maybe needs to be reminded that you're on his side and want to help him feel better. Maybe he is not willing to acknowledge depression... I'm still having a hard time with that.

I don't know if this helps any at all but what you're doing is a lot. He does need to see that and he does need help. It just might take a bit of the fight or flight response to get a fire going again. 

If you think or worry at all he might be prone to hurting himself, you should definitely ignore what I've said.

Sorry for a long winded ramble. I do hope things start to look up, even if there's a struggle I hope you will be able to see a light as will your husband.

Edit: one of the above posts mentions focusing on how you say he's a good husband. I'd say that's something that can help. When he says I'm sorry for being a bad husband, tell him that he's a great husband, tell him why you love him, then let him know that you think he isn't being good to himself and you want to help because he deserves better... But he has to put effort even if it's hard. Small things. Talking to a therapist may not be his favorite but the effort to get better is something in its own right.","d2q7g12",4,1462225972,"2016-05-02 21:52:52"

"7646","They do this for two reasons

1)  When a person is running out of energy with attention they fidget, or when they get bored.  So someone fidgeting may mean you are losing their attention and then you demand it ... rudely...
2)  You are sending a lot of chaotic muscle movements with your ody movements, humans read other peoples body language on an unconscious level to analyze the situation such as do you like the presentation or you are annoyed, bored, do not care, etc.  You are making it harder for them to focus.

The best thing in my experience is to tell people I am a fidget-er without mention adhd.  Telling them that me twirling my pen is how I am better able to focus, it allows me to be an active participant with active engaging listening.  Most people get this, the ones that do not I really do not care if I offend.

I‚Äôve been in your exact situation, unemployed and terrible with paperwork and deadlines for needed assistance. Although it wasn‚Äôt ideal, I moved back home, it was a tough decision due to pride and friction with my mother. I took the opportunity to mend my finances, restore my self worth and direct myself into a better career path. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but I used that moment to find the positive within every situation I encountered. To make ease of lose of pride I acknowledged the fact that it made my mother happy to have me home again. I know it sounds small, but I had nothing monetary to offered and yet I was still able to do something nice for a person by making them happy.

IMO 9-5 is the worst block of time to work in. It encompasses the most required times of the day for a person to accomplish required tasks with businesses. I‚Äôve worked every shift throughout my career, if possible choose a job with a shift leaving time in either the beginning of the day or the end of day to be able to take care of your needs. Currently I am self employed, which comes with its own issues of motivation. But if I didn‚Äôt engrave that regiment of working a dedicated shift for someone else then I wouldn‚Äôt have ever done it for myself. 

I can appreciate the level of stress you have, but at this moment the stress does not help with thinking clearly. Brainstorm and make some notes, within these notes write out the ideas you have of work you would like to do. Write out the ideas of how you can move forward again on your path to success. Write out the short term  goals in life you want to achieve. Seeing these ideas in front of you can help you find the path you lost along the way.","femofea",1,1579264681,"2020-01-17 12:38:01"

"7672","Thank you for your reply, I appreciate your input. You‚Äôre right in that this is only my experience and may not be true for everyone. Sometimes I do need a humility check! The last thing ‚ÄúI hope this helps‚Äù was because I commented this elsewhere and several people said it helped them realize the difference a lot, so I figured it may help other people as well. You‚Äôre definitely right I don‚Äôt have all the answers and I can see how this sounds smug and paints with a broad stroke. 

As far as the forgetfulness, I see what you‚Äôre saying. I think the biggest problem with my post and wording is the use of the word ‚Äúlazy.‚Äù I based this off another persons post. I was using this word to mean ‚Äúdoes not want to do X activity and so does not do it‚Äù to compare it to ‚Äúdoes want to do X activity but does not do it.‚Äù It‚Äôs definitely true that you can forget to do tasks you *need* to do, that may even be hard for you to do, but don‚Äôt necessarily want to do. For example, in high school I used to get yelled at literally everyday because I‚Äôd inevitably forget to do some household chore (my mom also had other issues, that‚Äôs another story...). I literally would *forget*. I couldn‚Äôt make my brain remember. Did I want to do the dishes? Hell no! But would I have done them if I hadn‚Äôt gotten distracted? Yes! 

I was just contrasting how it feels to want something and yet fail to do it (over and over after trying a million times) and to not want something and therefore not do it. I also think it might be unhelpful to use school as an example for this maybe. I *love* school so homework was something I *did* want to do, yet struggled with.  It‚Äôs different if you don‚Äôt like school though, that‚Äôs for sure.

"7689","Nah, but you may find that things are really different. I have a similar story, but I'm 20 years younger. Doctors just didn't realize, I think, how many females have ADHD or what it looks like. For me, there were a lot of feelings about it. When you get tagged with a diagnosis like bipolar, it shapes how you think of yourself. I had ideas about ADHD, as well, because of all those people who said they had it when they hadn't been diagnosed but wanted to excuse their behavior. It was hard for me. Ritalin was the miracle drug that I never found before, but it does make my brain work differently. I'm working on changing those ""not helpful to ADHD"" habits that I've got.

The good news is that you've got experience living in your body (including your brain), and you are probably more aware of yourself and what's going on than when you were younger.","e4wuvb4",3,1535372724,"2018-08-27 12:25:24"

"7702","If it's available in your area, Adderall will probably be the next go-to. I personally don't experience fidgeting as it wears off. I do, however,  find it very difficult to focus as it is wearing off. 

The 'come down' from most ADHD medications will have an impact on focus and fidgeting. The best way to avoid an impact as a result of it would probably just be to figure out a good time to take the medicine. Make sure you take it at a time that it will last thru the portion of the day you need it most. 

Alternatively, you could ask about Ritalin, it is functionally the IR version of Concerta. You may have to take it multiple times a day. However, as a result of the re-dosing, you can make sure it is still working until your day is over. 

You talk about hyperactive tendencies as your meds are wearing off, this happens to me as well. I was prescribed Adderall exclusively for the treatment of ADD (ADHD-PI). Before I was taking it, I had trouble focusing, and very slight fidgety type things. However, after taking Adderall for awhile, I get FAR more fidgety as it is wearing off. Far more than I was prior to taking the drug completely. All of that being said, I think it is possible the medication is increasing your hyperactive tendencies, as it had(s) done so for me.

**Edit:** I should also probably say that it is of course possible that you are only noticing the hyperactivity more because you know what it feels like to, well, not have as bad of hyperactive symptoms. Finally, I suppose I should also say that I'm not a med professional, I don't study medicine, and I am only another person with ADHD that also knows people with ADHD. Everything I'm saying only comes from experience.

**Edit2:** I just looked at your dose, and from what I know, 20mg is low. In fact, I was originally prescribed Concerta and took 58mg, my friend also takes somewhere around 100mg. It may very well be that your dosage is low. If the dosage is increased, it will make the half life longer. Which would, as a result, increase the duration of the medicine.

"7736","I have a lot of management experience. First, it's great that you immediately took ownership and responsibility for your mistake. Kudos to you for that. The more annoying employees are the ones that waste a ton of time blaming others for their own mistakes. So many people find it hard to say ""I fucked up."" We ALL fuck up from time to time. If I was your manager, you'd get huge points for this. Now we can talk about how to address this going forward, rather than endlessly spiraling in CYA and denial and finger pointing. 

That said you did blame your ADHD. 

It's okay you confided, but please do not make a habit of using your ADHD as your excuse. That gets old fast. I have managed people with all sorts of health issues, disabilities, personal life stressors, etc. I am happy to make allowances and work with an employee during a temporary situation, or adapt the work to fit the person's weaknesses and strengths if it's a longer-term issue. But do realize this may mean you end up on the slow-track rather than fast-track. You may get slotted into jobs that aren't as demanding and responsible. 

More importantly, realize that your boss may now be taking steps to document a later dismissal. If your performance has not been up to par and he wants to fire you, he needs to build a case for it. This means he needs to let you know you fucked up. And put it in writing. Then meet with you to talk about your objectives, and how you will meet them. What you need to meet them. And when. He will need to micromanage you and document that he did everything in his power to get you to perform, but you missed deadlines and did not meet objectives. It will take months to do this, and the good news is, you have the opportunity to turn things around. 

I have had to do this with employees myself, some turned it around with lots of guidance, clear-set goals, and training or whatever was needed. Others did not turn it around, and they wound up eventually fired. 

If after your meeting your boss sends you an email reiterating what you discussed, you can bet you are on notice. 

Is he a good boss? Yes. Is he a friendly boss who's going to let you slack off and use ADHD as your excuse? Maybe not.

If you can slow yourself down you will find yourself less overwhelmed.  When I get overwhelmed by moving to fast it causes me to freeze up.

"7756","I am newly diagnosed and still sorting through things, but I think the fatigue is a separate issue.  I have only my own experience here, but I suspect that it is too easy to confuse/rationalize fatigue as the reason we are unable to do things.  This is what led me to realize that ADHD was a likely source of my problems.

Which I'm probably not explaining well, but here goes.  I've had fatigue in the past.  In my case, there was no medical reason, just the usual poor eating habits/poor exercise habits/poor sleeping habits, frequently exacerbated by depression/anxiety.  Well, I've addressed the mood disorders, (and am not currently medicated for those, so no side effects there to account for).  I've fixed my regular health habits, and have the conventional physical proof (vital signs/blood tests/athletic performance) to back that up.  Frankly, right now I'm in the best shape in my life.  So, faced with STILL being unable to do basic things, I've been repeating to myself ""well, I'm just too tired"" and slowly realizing that that isn't true, my problem isn't lack of energy per se, it's lack of starting power.  

So I don't think ADHD *causes* fatigue.  I think ADHD is a major obstacle in regulating eating/sleeping exercising properly (it took me years to build those good habits, and they use all the motivation I have).  Whether your fatigue is originating from something entirely separate, or from failing to maintain good health habits, ADHD makes it harder to do what you need to do to fix it.

IANAD, just sayin', but if there is a ""real"" medical reason you are fatigued, and the meds let you artificially push past that condition, I suspect the long term outcome will be physically worse, my two cents.   Also, I just started Vyvanse, and it is life-changing, but it has raised my heart rate, and I've been physically active for sure (I can finally clean my damn house), but I'll want that to settle down before I start training for a marathon or anything, even though I feel like I could.

Speak to your GP, they aren't able to make a diagnosis by themselves as it needs a psychiatric evaluation. If you can go private, do so if you don't want to wait - I was on the waiting list for Sheffield for about 7 months, and it can be much longer. But make sure if you do go private to ask your GP if they'll accept a private diagnosis and 'shared care', i.e. the psychiatrist evaluates you and prescribes you the medicine, which you can then get via your GP/Chemist for free on the NHS. Then it's back to the psychiatrist for evaluations, making sure your dosage is right, and then once that's sorted out they hand you off more or less to the GP who takes over your care from then on.

I hope this was helpful, since we're the same age and everything please DM me if you want to, and I can give you some contact details for discord or whatever and we can talk.

Try to get homework done asap after that (before 5pm). And then do something that allows some physical running around after that, or going out for an evening walk together if you can.

My husband and I came to feel that the mental strain of trying to be ""good"" at school all day, even with the help of medication, just fell apart when the meds wore off. The kids were more on edge, short tempered, more likely to melt down. They were always several years behind their peers in being able to regulate their emotions, and we had to have extra patience to not be reactive to this.

We had a fair amount of success with evening activities (scouting, swimming, skating, soccer). Usually once we got there they enjoyed it, but transitioning from being at home to going out again in the evening could be difficult.

Stay calm, praise small successes, make your child feel you are a team, and you'll work with him to help him navigate through social situations. My kids ended up being pretty sensitive to reading how other kids were reacting to them, and learned how to tone down and self-regulate by high school.

"7829","Well, that's the thing. I did quite well in school. Actually excelled until the end of college. I was having difficulties concentrating, focusing in on stuff and organizing ideas. Taking stimulants enabled me to process information and sustained them without having thoughts go all over the place. For the longest time I attributed these problems to smoking way too much marijuana throughout college.  
It wasnt until recently that my anxiety started to get really bad and these other issues started to manifest. So I wonder if /u/davesfakeaccount has a point.  
I've tried Wellbutrin. Great stuff, although when I brought it up to my therapist as a drug that's helped me she suggested that depression doesn't seem to be the issue or at least not the primary.

### Distractions

- For planning around distractions I borrow from Steven A. Safren's ""Mastering Your Adult ADHD: A Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment Program"" on planning around your distractibility delay. Start a task with a timer and figure out how long it takes you for you to be distracted then plan with that amount of time. This of this as a customized pomodoro length. 

- For eliminating distractions, there are multiple books that address this. The best way I've found is to create a list with two columns: Triggers of distraction | Method to remove that distraction. Personally I've turned off notifications on all my apps &amp; devices, except for a select few. I've browser blocked websites that are known to distract me. I wear hearing protection muffs + earbuds underneath to remove distracting sounds. I've also given parental controls to my SO. I can't download or use the browser on my phone.

- For handling distractions that pop up frequently. I make a two column list: Type of distracting thought | How to handle it. Then I create implementation intentions. ex. IF I get distracted by wanting to tell someone something THEN I will evaluate its importance and either text now or wait until I've finished my current task. I have a LOT of implementation intentions memorized.

- For distractions that are internal and random: The first step is the be mentally aware that you're having a distracting thought. Then deal with it. Write it down note it and come back to it later after you're done with the task. The hardest part is being mentally aware of it. Meditation helps with this.

### Aversive tasks 

I started off with this paper https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.2182
But turning that paper into actionable knowledge requires a lot more experimentation. The most useful aspects from that paper for me were focus on positive consequences, monitor one's progress, and emotional regulation. Personally I've found other more useful ideas. 

You have to learn how to deal with things that are holding you back AND techniques to help you get started. 

- You have to diagnose why you're procrastinating and have a solution/counter to each.
  EX. negative thinking, stress, unclear steps, too large steps, sensory issues, trauma, not enough self-care, fear, fear of failing

- Getting started. 
   - I find the custom pomodoro lengths to be useful.
   - I use a modified downwards arrow technique from CBT to apply the focus on positive consequences. 
   - Make the first step so small and easy to do. It helps you build confidence.
   - Something that is very underrated. You have to learn how to manage your mood. Yale's 'The Science of Well-Being' on coursera is pretty good. Also SCHEDULE your self-care and choose how you self-care wisely. I used to justify playing video games as self-care but then I realized I always felt drained afterwards instead of engaged and recharged.

"7925","I believe this is pretty common for many of us, and I have had the same issue since my teens. (12-16 years or so now)

It's really weird, being perpetually tired from lack of sleep and still not being able to go to bed. 

I have tried many things, and I'll add them with a quick description:

* Light Therapy

I thought I might have a delayed rhythm, and read it can at least temporarily be adjusted by exposure to daylight early in the morning. I bought a daylight lamp for $50 or so, and started doing it for 30-60min first thing every morning. It made me feel more awake and energized during the day, gave me a better mood AND actually made me sleepy in the evening! By far the easiest and most effective things I have tried, and still do during the winter.

* Chilipad

Quite expensive and surprisingly noisy, this one helped A LOT. Every time I am unable to sleep, I notice how I start sweating and getting warmer. This is related to the circadian rhythm, and your body temperature needs to drop a bit before you'll be able to fall asleep. The Chilipad holds a consistent temperature the whole night, effectively preventing this normal overheating and making you fall asleep instead. 

I had to stop using it because my ex would be tired every day from the noise, instead of me being tired from lack of sleep. I believe there are newer models available now, and considered getting a newer once because sleep is so important.

* **Exercise**

People have told me this helps, and it does. But compared to the chilipad and light therapy, the positive impact on sleep has been negligible. It's great for most other things in life, mood, energy, willpower and health, just not that much for sleep. The exception being if you go for a run in the sun early in the morning. Then the light might aid in sleep later.

* **Supplement: Theanine**

Easily one of my all-time favorite supplements, as it can prevent the crash from coffee, improves focus, reduce stress and anxiety, and has proved to improve sleep quality in young boys with ADHD. For those of you that can't sleep because of racing thoughts, fear, and overthinking, this is well worth checking out. (it also reduces the impact hangovers to some extent) Theanine is also the active ingredient in green tea.

* **Starting early**

This one I obviously struggle with. I have an alarm to remind me to start preparing for bed, that I often snooze. But I'm starting to respect it more and more every day I'm tired. Awareness is key I believe, and imagining what it would feel like if you actually went to bed earlier today. I often end up ""just doing one more thing"", resulting in it still being late, but it's getting better.

You could also consider taking sleeping pills at a set time every day for a limited duration, just to get some help getting on track. But they are highly addictive, so be careful if you do. It does really help to get out of a bad, long-lasting pattern though.","g8q0e39",1,1602617199,"2020-10-13 19:26:39"

"7927","That‚Äôs ok too, don‚Äôt be offended by those who answer like that. They might have it as well. I tell all those people to worry about it seriously and to at least do a free self assessment online using the population self-check questionnaire by the World Health Organisation.

"7929","I don't think there's any doom making it impossible to deal with the ADHD symptoms, it just becomes much harder than for the average person.

Your bosses advice might not be bad, although, depending on the coworker, getting an actual specialist helping you with these things could be better.

Some suggestions from my own ongoing process in dealing with these things:

For the lateness, try to figure out why you're late. Misjudging time it takes to get there? Not a consistent calendar? Subconsciously avoiding being early and risking suffering the boredom of waiting? Being too accommodating and booking meetings back-to-back? Some things can be resolved, others can be improved by at least asserting in advance that the schedule makes it impossible to make it, so it's me late or no me at all.

For details, check lists can be a good structural aid. The more important it gets to not miss something, the more important it is to actually have structured validation that every detail is done, and this isn't unique to ADHD. Extreme situations even call for someone else actually going through a check list and validating everything. So if things are important enough, either organized people like your coworker might already have them or you can team up and make them as it improves quality for everyone.

For priority, figure out if there's any supporting evidence for the prioritization. Or ask for aid in getting things prioritized. Some newer 'agile' project management techniques have a specific role (scrum product owner for example) for assigning and enforcing priority as it is an issue that plagues everyone as priority is often a subjective judgement call.

Personally, this far I've also found it useful in dealing with these issues in relation to bosses or co workers to have open communication and asserting boundaries. They can get last-minute changes _or_ they get structured priorities. They can get revisions _or_ they can get attention to detail following a specification. They can get me on time _or_ they can get me putting in more hours and having back-to-back meetings.

Make it clear that you'll try to work within a meticulous structure if it's possible, but also make it clear that interruptions of that structure carry a price and that they can't have it both ways. That shifts the 'blame' into an active and rational choice that they make which makes both them and you less likely to be unsatisfied.","clfcz8q",2,1413871888,"2014-10-21 06:11:28"

Sometimes it helps me to stop looking at those symptoms and live without thought of your disorder for a while. Even for a few hours or days.

I think the key is to block her on social media platforms temporarily so that you can't see her. My ex did this to me and I am actually thankful, though it did make me sad in the moment.... it helped me move on.

Also.... make some plans with friends in the evening when you can. Even if it is just playing an online video game together or making time for a chat or call. Reminding yourself of the other connections in your life will help you heal.

If you can't arrange stuff with friends plan ahead to what you will do in the evening. Pick out what video game you will play or movie you will watch or book you will read, or craft you will do.

So wait until you are supposed to get it refilled even if that means you go days without anything. And then get a refill. And don't up your dose. 

The high is going to substantially reduce every time you dose like that till popping 90mg straight will do diddly all. Then the actual addiction kicks in. And ruins your life.

I will say though, in the case you *don't* have ADHD, that doesn't mean that you have nothing 'wrong' or that you have zero struggles. You could have a different kind of disorder, or, even if you are completely neurotypical, your struggles could be something related to your life growing up that can be worked out with therapy. A 'non-ADHD' result doesn't mean ""Oh you're just fucking stupid and suck at everything."" All it would mean is you don't have ADHD. 

Regardless, try not to stress about the results as much as you can. You will deal with it when you deal with it. Right now, worrying can't do anything.

You'll never get rid of the old negative thought patterns if you don't find new ones to replace them with.   Um....the brain doesn't exist in a vacuum I guess? Or something.   

But when they say ""Positive thoughts""  it's not necessarily bullshit ""I'm good enough, smart enough.."" etc.   For example: when I was super depressed, my brain's favorite mantra was ""I'm a (total) loser"". The first thing I replaced it with was ""I am not a complete loser.""  (I could believe that, because logically speaking I didn't fail at EVERYTHING.  I certainly couldn't tell myself ""I'm a winner,"" because that was totally false at the time. This allowed me to be able to work on things and get better at them.)  Then I upgraded to ""I'm not a loser.""  It may seem weird that that was my mantra for a while, but it was something I could believe, and it was something that wasn't completely negative.

"8096","That is amazing! If you are satisfied by this and do not wish to explore other medicinal treatment methods for depression, then more power to you! 

If you by chance care, I will relate with my own experience. Before I was diagnosed with ADHD at 20, I was struggling with depression. I was first diagnosed with depression at 16, started Prozac, which caused me to show hypomanic symptoms, so then I was misdiagnosed as bipolar. I went through more drugs than I remember when trying to stabilize my mood. Fortunately (after a breakdown, several months unmedicated, the mental hospital, and a few more months unmedicated), I eventually saw a great therapist and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder recurrent type. I didn't start meds right away, but did eventually go on Wellbutrin, which did wonders for me. When diagnosed with ADHD (got tested because my ADD Dad suggested it), I went right on Vyvanse (because it works for my Dad and brother, so it was a safe bet it would work for me). Those two combined are like magic for me. Works amazingly well. That's just my personal story. I used to not think I would even live to be this old, let alone happy and engaged and working and continuing my education and yadda yadda, thriving. Wellbutrin is a drug that is a reuptake inhibitor for dopamine and norepinephrine. Works wonders. It also acts as a stimulant, so double good for those with comorbid depression and ADHD. 

Just my two cents- many medications are out there. Other depression &amp; bipolar meds I tried before Wellbutrin made me gain weight. Wellbutrin has some side-effects, but way less than other things I took.

As long as you are doing good, then you keep doing what you are doing. Not trying to push pills on you or say that dogs aren't an effective treatment for depression. I think you are inspiring for being able to put your own shit aside to nuture and love a dog, especially since it is beneficial for both of you. ","dhtf439",2,1495303431,"2017-05-20 18:03:51"

"8099","Thank you for putting this out there. As someone who also works in-clinic, I've done thousands of prior auths. It is such a pain in the ass to get these done. I've literally had insurance companies say no to PAs for VITAL medications and have had to work and wait on them to review clinic notes, schedule a direct phone call from their doctor to the clinic doctor, appeal to the appeal letters, etc..  It‚Äôs awful! Meanwhile I'll have the patient anxiously waiting and getting (understandably) impatient. Our healthcare system is a nightmare and medication coverage really suffers because of it. So, as much as it seems simple from the outside (and I believe it should be!), when these come up they're hell to deal with. Some medications are easier than others. Same with MRIs or mammograms. Christ, the red tape you have to jump through. I've had instances when a patient desperately needed an MRI because of heavy risk factors (family history, etc) and something abnormal on a previous screening, and after all the PA work, the appeals, and finally a direct physician-to-physician call, they STILL denied coverage!!! So this patient had to either not get a medically necessary MRI if they couldn't pay for it or do it and be completely on the hook as self-pay. That was so enraging. It was even worse before the ACA. Women with the gene mutation that causes ovarian and breast cancer and needed a preemptive hysterectomy or mastectomy could be denied coverage by insurance if they decided it was a pre-existing condition or that it wasn't part of the woman's plan. Pregnancy coverage was ridiculous. Sorry, had to rant because this all won't get better anytime soon but the struggle is so real ü§Ø./rant","gepmsc7",2,1607186938,"2020-12-05 16:48:58"
"8100","I would listen to your doctor. If she's worried about your weight then you should be too. My psych has told me many times that eating disorders are becoming alarmingly common with meds, and it's obviously very damaging. I know it's not the same for everyone, but for me my eating (on my current med, Vyvanse) was screwed for about two weeks. After that it returned to a more healthy state. Two weeks is a pretty standard wait time. During that time I lost about 5-10 pounds, and if it hadn't been for my freshman 15 I would have been underweight, and that's not good. 

Regardless of what choices are made, you need to inform your school of the situation right away. If you're not registered with your school's Accessible Learning Centre (or equivalent) then you should do so. They'll help you out with the bumps ahead.

Your absolute focus should be eating well, above all else. You need to be eating 3-5 *healthy* meals a day. Eat breakfast. I don't give a fuck if you're not hungry. You eat. Things like meal replacements and smoothies will help you out immensely  as in-between meals. Not only will this help your body, it'll help your mind, cliche as that sounds. Eating well will make a big difference in your mental state. When I was depressed I was eating one meal a day (usually pizza) at about 9pm. When I got help, I began eating five small meals a day, and the difference was greater than night and day, it really was.

I'm sorry, I don't want to seem like I'm nagging, 'cause I'm not trying to. But you really, really need to eat well. I know I'm a stranger on the internet, but I've been in the same boat as you, and I know how it sucks. 

But yeah, talk to you school (asap, doesn't matter what choices you make) and start eating better. [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/t7543/some_tips_for_eating_on_vyvance_and_other_such) is the the adhd-specific eating guide I made. It's long, but please take some time to check it out.

"8115","That's interesting. I only started Meds a month ago and was doing fairly well on the 15 mg xr I got from walgreens. I 100% saw the positive effects of the medication consistently through the month, however it was very subtle. My doctor upped the dosage this month to 20mg xr (I told her the changes were subtle and weren't lasting as long, she said lets up the dose a little and see if it will last longer/be better first).

I initially got my first from Walgreens and then changed my pharmacy (Fred Meyers), I know very little about medication/pharmacy processes. When I looked it looked at the bottle it different from my initial 15mg xr, I know that some med increases/decreases can change the look, but it looked more different then that. I only changed it because I thought it would be cheaper.

I've been taking it for 3 days, and haven't noticed any benifits. I don't think its because of the increase either - I don't feel anxious, jittery...just more unfocused and even tired/lethargic and unmotivated, if maybe slightly more alert? Which you could say is my ADHD but I felt better with the 15mg xr (but it wasn't enough, it was very subtle). If anything I experience more hyperfocus, but not the calm focus previously, where I felt more normal (and I hate hyperfocus unless I need it) - it feels like it amped up my ADHD but not in a stimulant way either.

I didn't realize generics were manufactured differently, but I had an inkling these were ""different"" so I found that my 20mg xr is made by Elite And the 15mg xr prebiously was made by Shire (or Sandoz? Not sure if they are essentially the same). So I've been doing research and it seems like Teva / Shire-Sandoz seem to be the most effective for most people (I'm sure there are exceptions) and largley many of the other generics (like aurobindo) either have no effect, the opposite effect, or just plain bad.

Everything I've read about the Elite adderall has been subpar/not great (not much out there, but there isn't much positivity about it especially in comparison to the Teva/Shire-Sandoz). So annoying, it was so nice having relief from my ADHD. In hindsight I'm glad I figured this out really early so I know that indeed different generics can actually have different effects (I guess they're ""techincally"" not supposed to? But that doesn't seem right to me with the research I'm doing, seems like many people with ADHD meds have said there is indeed a difference) instead of taking a pill that didn't work for months because I didn't realize that part of the issue is the brand of the generic.

Frankly I feel almost nothing from the Elite, having coffee would be more effective, and maybe I need a lower dose (don't think this is the case) but I don't even feel like I'm on a stimulant either. Next time I'll try to look out for the Shire/Sandoz or Tera brand.","g1s9anc",1,1597620806,"2020-08-16 23:33:26"

"8118","Suspected it for a very long time (Mum thought I did since I was 6) but in second last year of university (age 22) I went for exam feedback for one of my modules (my marks were all over the place so I was trying to work out what I was doing wrong). It had previously been two separate modules, but they decided to stitch them both together into one module because they were apparently so similar and that people always got similar results in them both. I'd got 45% overall (a pass) which I was disappointed by because I felt like I'd done really well. So went to the first lecturer for exam feedback who taught one half of the module, he told me that in his half of the exam I'd gotten 77% (a first), so I did well. Went to the second lecturer for the second half of the module and I'd gotten 13% (really really hard fail). He was kinda like wtf why? and I was like I dunno, and he was like do you have learning disabilities?, and I was like I dont think so.

So I ignored it and then 6 months later I hard failed another module with a different lecturer, went for a meeting and he asked me if I had learning disabilities.

So I ignored it or a few more months and then got super curious one day and went to the learning disabilities people at university. My university is a top 1% of the world university, joined to a hospital and specialises in Psychology, Pharmacy and Medicine, so I trust these guys for this kinda stuff and I thought I'd get more insight than if I just went to a shitty NHS doctor. Did a self check assessment for ADHD, had to do tests for other things too. A week later went for a meeting (arrived 2 hours early woops) he spoke to me for about 2 hours and made me do a load more tests - to check that my memory was normal and stuff, and eventually he told me that he had enough evidence to diagnose me with Dyslexia and ADHD. He said I was a classic case of ADHD and he was surprised that I'd even made it to the last year of university hahaha. He also said that I scored in the bottom 1% of the population for information processing but I think that that's part of Dyslexia.

He gave me a letter to give to my doctor with all the tests and his blah blah so that I can get medication or whatever but I still haven't done it yet. I think that was April? I'm going to do it next week. :|","dlxz4qd",3,1503354593,"2017-08-21 22:29:53"

I thought it was normal to be unable to function, to stop going to school and fail a semester, lose my job, etc.

Neurotypicals around me didn't feel it was normal, they were worried.

&amp;#x200B;

And, quite honestly, the neurotypicals around me, even in the face of emotional pain, could still function is the same situations. For them, heartbreak meant weekends in PJs, watching movies while ugly crying, eating junk food and drinking wine. Like, you know, the stereotypical way of dealing with a break up. Come Monday morning, the would pick themselves up and go to work. If need be, they would resume the ugly crying and junk food eating in the evenings. 

But they wouldn't drop out of school or lose their jobs.

In my opinion, you've always had that box in your head, but like me, you just didn't have access to it without the meds.

You're 20. Believe me, I was able to function with next to no sleep and no meds at 20! At 36, meds or no, I simply can't! And if I somehow manage to do it with the meds, I will pay dearly for it!

You have no reason to feel guilty about the meds. It's okay if you feel that way, but the reality is that you do not have a 1up over anybody else. The meds put you on the same level as them. It simply that it's new to you! You're not yet used to have a brain that doesn't fight against you all day.

"8153","&gt; The sheer fact that you assume I have no idea what capitulating means, shows that you naturally look down on other people, thinking greatly of yourself.

&gt;&gt; i.e. starting to study then getting distracted, or becoming overwhelmed easily and feel like giving up?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, stop staring into the void. The more you stare into it, the more you feel like capitulating. So stop that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If this was so easy, do you think I'd be taking medicine in the first place? While we're at it, let's totally disregard that this was a question about ADHD.

Really? Because I'm pretty sure it's just you that I'm looking down on for not recognizing that what you said is the definition of capitulation.  

&gt; No, you probably don't give a shit.

You're smarter than you sound. 

&gt; I'm certainly not bored, as I have always found my classes interesting but extremely challenging, largely due to my condition. 

So then up your dosage and stop complaining. If it's not ADHD related, then upping the dosage won't do anything. If it is, then problem solved. 

&gt; Using your ideas, it seems that you struggled with being unmotivated or with a lack of interest in material.

No, I persevered and it was terrible. I realized that it wasn't a lack of interest or motivation but a chemical imbalance. So I did something about it. I also realized that ADHD doesn't exist in a vacuum and that the stressors in your life influence it. If you take your meds and you find yourself still being distracted, the either up the dosage or the meds aren't what's causing it. ","d69913t",1,1470677502,"2016-08-08 17:31:42"

"8158","Sure! All ADHD meds are sensitive to anything acidic in your stomach - so if you have a big glass of orange juice or coffee right before taking your meds, they're not going to work as well. I try to leave an hour between coffee and meds which probably isn't long enough, but it's what I've been able to work out.

Vyvanse in particular is tricky because of its mechanism of action. You want to start off with a good meal, but then you need to keep eating throughout the day so the rest of the dose releases. It's also going to be a smoother ride if you keep yourself full, and it will last longer. Basically, the more you give your body to digest, the longer it's going to take for Vyvanse to finish releasing medicine, giving you a slower, smoother and longer lasting dose. 

You don't need to overeat or have a huge meal every few hours. I would do a filling breakfast, protein bar, light lunch, snack, filling dinner, and then snack with nightime meds kinda deal. That's how I prefer to eat anyway, so it worked for me.

I get nauseated and bloated on my period so I never want to eat. I go for a lot of smoothies, which often contain citric acid that makes my meds not work as well so...yeah. It's a balancing act.

I really hope Vyvanse works for you. I was never able to get the hang of it. It killed my appetite. I could never eat once I'd taken the pill. Adderall affects my appetite too, but nothing like that. I don't want to bias you against Vyvanse at all, but just be really really careful with your diet while taking it.","d4idcpu",1,1466536629,"2016-06-21 19:17:09"

Ritalin was too short acting so I switched to Vyvanse, which upped my ""resting"" anxiety again. However it's much easier to step it back down with meditation or CBT since my brain doesn't lock on to the anxiety; I can shift my focus and deal with it like a normal person for once.

I will try Concerta once they get the generic situation sorted. I am hoping that doesn't have the same anxiety side effect.. but I can live with it if it does! Life is so much better.","cnddg7x",5,1420316155,"2015-01-03 20:15:55"

Bills, chores, even simple things like remembering to call our grandparents back or stupid stuff like that...you put two ADD/ADHDers together and it can be hard to support each other.

I take dexedrine for the ADD, as well as several meds for bipolar and anxiety, and they help a lot. For sure. But obviously its not a panacea. I've been going to therapy on and off for over a decade and I've never *loved* it. Definitely felt that patronizing thing.

I DO have an outstanding memory of my childhood years, and growing up though. Places, people, smells, tastes, events. All of that I can remember in great detail, even as young as 3 or 4 years old (24 now). My sister is two years younger than me, and I remember her being an infant even at times.

I'll say stuff to my parents and they'll look at each other, startled at the fact that I remember events and have these memories.

In fact, one of my most distinct early memories was going with my father to his play practices when he was in the local Guild of the Arts. I was no older than 4 and I'd go with him night after night to the practices and I'd see them rehearse, but them turn a blank, black stage into everything from a manor, to the midwest, to a carnival to a rickety old house.

I can always tell if I've lost/gained even the smallest amount of weight by the way my clothes feel. If I've gained even just a lb or two wearing clothes that feel 'off' make me super agitated and I  feel like I have to take them off immediately, which will in turn trigger my body dysmorphia &amp; make my disordered eating thoughts much louder and harder to ignore.

I don't know if it is related or not, but I also have this thing with dirty dishes and kitchen/bathtub drains. The only way I can touch dirty dishes to put them into the dishwasher is if I'm running hot water over them as I pick them up and I absolutely cannot clean food particles out of the kitchen drain or (blegh) hair buildup on the bathtub drain.

Adult ADHD refers to when the ADHD was diagnosed. ADHD can look a little different in adults, but the distinction has more to do with age than it being a separate thing. 

Self-loathing is often associated with adult ADHD because those of us who were diagnosed as adults have had ADHD our whole lives but didn't know it ‚Äî so we've spent our lives feeling different than our peers, struggling with the things that you mentioned in your post (performing in school and work, falling short of expectations), without a context for understanding why.

"8241","TL:DR, got recently diagnosed (27F) after engineering degree and 6 years working at the same high pressure job. Went through an ADHD specialized clinic and had a very positive experience to get diagnosed without any talk of being ""too smart for ADHD"".

I got recently diagnosed at age 27 (female, combination type), am an engineer 6 years out of school and have a relatively successful and stable career. I've been struggling with focus and motivation for a long time but didn't let it show.

My ADHD diagnosis journey involved a short-lived stint of anxiety meds, a therapist that insisted I was struggling only due to COVID stress and finally a drunken confession of my struggles to a friend with ADHD.

After doing some online tests that identified me as a likely candidate, I was nervous about this too, that I was somehow gaming the system to get the answer I wanted. But so many of the symptoms clicked for me so I pursued it.

I'm so happy I did. My assessment process was really thorough and eye-opening, and I didn't once feel like my concerns were minimized because I'm smart. I think it depends on your dr/the clinic but my assessment included:
- discussions with a coach and physiologist
- discussion with a psychiatrist about medical history
- reviews of my school transcripts (they were really interested in my elementary school ones with notes from the teachers)
- questionnaires from people close to me (I did my parents and best friend/roommate)

After the first session with a coach I was convinced I had it, and they definitely triggered old memories from my childhood. The final report also highlighted if there was potential for any other diagnoses that were more likely or as a comorbidity, which was interesting. They talked a lot about how women with ADHD especially can slip through the cracks when they have a high intellect to fall back on and present as more inattentive type.","gbwqn2f",2,1605072355,"2020-11-11 05:25:55"

"8254","I saw a comment here the other day that really stuck with me.  It was something along the lines of how us with ADHD have to throw out the standard user's manual, and write our own.  Because it quickly becomes obvious that the usual organizational methods and strategies that work for neurotypical people are not gonna work for us.  So we have to keep trying to figure out what does work, and build off of that.  Some of us do great with lists of to-do tasks and feel great satisfaction in checking things off.  Others of us (me, for one) will spend hours getting their list juuust perfect, and then promptly forget that it even exists.  

ADHD can be very hard to cope with, especially as a teenager when so many different aspects of your life are in flux.  However, you are NOT lazy and stupid.  If you were actually lazy, you wouldn't give a shit about blowing off homework and studying, but you seem to care deeply about them and are distressed by your inability to do these things.  If you were stupid, you wouldn't look at yourself and worry about not working to what you KNOW your full potential to be.  

Once you get in to see a psyc, things will probably get much easier once you are on meds.  However, for right now try to stick to a schedule as much as you can.  Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends.  Try to eat well and do exercise that you don't mind (the more novel the activity, the better).  Caffeine can actually help to an extent, since it's a mild stimulant and all the ADHD drugs (pretty much) are stimulants.  

Good luck to you, and all of us here understand perfectly what you are going through and know exactly how you are feeling.  I find that comforting, a sort of therapy I guess.  ","domojyx",3,1508491750,"2017-10-20 09:29:10"

It's also a movement that requires practice and skill to learn and those types of skills are difficult to pick up if you have issues with praxis or motor planning. Again not everyone with ADHD has sensory processing issues but the comorbidity is extremely strong. I think in general because people with ADHD have neuroanatomical differences in the structure of the cerebellum which is strongly influenced by tactile (touch), proprioceptive (awareness of body in space and joint position), and vestibular (sense of balance and motion) input, it would reason that processing of these pathways is likely different.

Personally, I couldn't stand it. I just stopped showing up after the 7th grade. 

It's both alarming and hysterical that I easily outrank people around me in literacy, critical thinking and so on while they have embossed on their briefcases the papers proving advanced 'education' wearing their heart on their sleeve and smugly looking down their noses at the so-called high-school peasantry.

I made the right decision - not going to college - I just *say* I did and noone flutters one eyelid. Who'd argue with the smart-as-fuck guy they just interviewed? There's sinply no need :)

Oh I earned my salary, I taught myself everything I know. I excel at what I do. 

I work with someone that has multiple degrees. He's also almost a decade older than me. I was forced to tone it down because I was making him look bad.

We live without while they live within. Only the strong of heart and spirit among us survive. The rest, unfortuanately, feel they have no choice but to embrace the next life.

But don't listen to me. I'm just crazy. In fact, the more you listen the clearer this assessment will seem and soon you'll decide that I just piss you off and/or I'm a terrible person.

I know noone else that tries to buy anyone genuinely hungry (are you made at me for deciding that I can tell?) a warm meal whenever I can afford it instead of ignoring them and/or tossing a sliver of change.

I'm not saying they should have different rules for us, in fact quite the opposite, I think they should be quite strict, but in a calm and understanding way, and with a lot of coaching instead of losing their temper and misunderstanding/judging the students for showing their symptoms etc.

"8317","I had a very restrictive youth, so I never really got to explore my interests until I was in my twenties. I didn't know what I liked to do. After several years of not being able to find anything that I felt like I could enjoy doing in the long term, I just figured that I had missed the boat because I had never learned how to enjoy myself as a kid; that my imagination was more fulfilling than life. Which led to a  pretty deep depression and self-destructive behavior.

"8324","I agree with what the previous poster said, you might need to ""lower"" your expectations.

Now, not everybody reaches therapeutic effects at the same dose. I need a ""high"" dose of Concerta to reach those effects. I was on 72mg for a long time, and I'm now at 63mg. 

You're not supposed to feel high on your medication. In my case, I don't feel anything on *Concerta*, but I do see its effects.

That being said, the side effects you are experiencing are the same I was experiencing on Vyvanse, which is the reason why I do not like that medication. Yes, they are common side effects from ADHD medication, but it doesn't mean you'll experience these side effects on every ADHD medication. 

As an aside, if you do stay on Concerta and eventually decide to try the 72mg, you can take two 36mg pills to achieve the 72mg dose, or 1 54mg and 1 18mg. That's what my pharmacist would give me if the were out of stock of the 72mg. Also, I've yet to meet somebody who takes 63mg like me, but that can be achieved with a 36mg and a 27mg pill.

"8332","Tip of advice from someone who is an avid cardio and training freak but also has severe ADHD + Asthma. The key to muscle gain and strength period is to push yourself to your limits, that means do what I call the ""stupid pump"" where you're basically basically training to failure. Simply doing 3 sets of 12 reps curling over a period of 4-6 weeks and you'll see some improvement, but only slightly. Your muscles only grow when you're pumping oxygen and blood into your cells, which requires lots of focused breathing and over training. I was fortunate enough to meet a Marine who had ADHD and how he was able to combat his counting problem with the distractions that came along with the ADHD. The main is the reason why I'm speaking to you now.

The key to all training with ADHD is your breathing and minimizing your distractions as much as possible, it's no wonder going to the gym helps out so much. So with the amount of distractions we experience on a daily basis, I'm not surprised that you're fucking up on your rep counts, because that happens to me all the time. On top of that, simply counting out the reps out loud you're not only exhaling and losing oxygen but just thinking the words themselves is a distraction, and the you're not focused on the movement of the curls or your breathing. You must minimize these distractions, and the key to that is to simply not count at all, you train to failure.

There are a lot of negative confrontations to over training and I'm one of those people who are trying to change that belief that over training is bad for your health. I have a 63% lung capacity due to my Asthma but I don't let that stop me from doing a full 45 minute Spartacus work, and then run 2 miles afterwards. The way I train is a circuit of 10 different work outs with 15 second breaks between each, and I never count the reps, in fact I don't know anymore what my rep numbers are, I just train to failure, and half the time when I am at the failure point I still do 1-3 more reps. My strength and muscle gains have exploded the past 5 months because of this, and it's a humbling feeling when you take out that fixed number count and you just go for broke. My advice to you my friend, if counting reps starts to negate your performance over time I suggest you stop counting altogether and work each set to failure. And if you think it sounds too hard, well guess what... it is. Took me 4 months to finally get in the routine and mindset and another 3 months to finally execute it.

One of the most beautiful things about working out, is any knucklehead can do it. There is absolutely no excuse to not train your body while having ADHD. Our ancestors were doing this naturally for thousands of years,  like someone jokingly said earlier in this thread, you're basically picking things up and putting them down. It's a joke how simple it is, which is probably why I do it so well. 

That is the best thing I've learned so far in the last year was this technique. Because taking meds is obviously bad for some individuals due to the side effects, but without it you'll be distracted and can't function during the day. SO trust me when I say this is the best thing you can do to combat that problem. It just requires you to have the courage to bust your ass that much harder. The principle is stupidly simple, it's just applying it over and over and over and over again, until it becomes like breathing again. 

Now with that said, I gotta go do my 2 miles....","cb7gn0j",6,1374449586,"2013-07-21 23:33:06"

Now I'm in a very relaxed, friendly atmosphere at work, and I'm figuring out what works for me.
- Setting deadlines: even if it's something simple and broad, like ""can you pick up your clothes before lunch""
- Specific instructions
- If she doesn't do it for a while, don't do it (unless it's urgent, of course). Eventually, she will do it. Give it time.
- Teach her how to do stuff and how to plan and prioritize. It's all about creating a structure.

"8335","Yeah, we need VAs on our own, haha. By the way, what do you do?

My backlog isn‚Äôt that bad (yet) to delegate it, I‚Äôve had much worse days. As for long-term, I don‚Äôt have enough patience to find someone good to delegate this work to and then train them for it for months. I‚Äôd just rather take care of it myself. And I feel that if I delegated it to someone, I‚Äôd miss this job - sometimes I do enjoy replying to emails :) 
Besides, we‚Äôve recently switched to a new mail management platform (Front) which looks nice and it makes replying to emails more rewarding. 
The last reason why I wouldn‚Äôt want to delegate is because I don‚Äôt really want to give away a big part of my monthly pay, I‚Äôd then have to look for another job and it probably won‚Äôt be easy to find someone who pays just for brainstorming ideas :)

I need to wait for a couple of months before going to Germany just to save some money - I always spend ALL my money each month, never save a penny, although my salary is pretty decent for local standards. I don‚Äôt want to tell my mom how much I earn because her reaction would probably be: ‚ÄúYou kids need to save for an apartment! What do you spend your money on?‚Äù. If I was on medication, I probably (I hope) would be able to save and not seek instant gratification by spending money on stuff I don‚Äôt really need or don‚Äôt afford, and ordering takeaway because I‚Äôm too lazy to cook healthy food for myself.

Anyway, I‚Äôll try to work a bit now. In 2 hours I‚Äôll need to go with my parents to our relatives to celebrate Easter (it‚Äôs the Orthodox one), and after that we‚Äôll probably have some friends over and I won‚Äôt get another chance to work today.

"8337","Thanks a lot for your reply! 

I am discussing medication with my neuropsychiatrist.  So far he's been trying to calm the tourettes side of things, but I feel I've got a firm grip on that already and aside from making noises and people looking at me strangely, it doesn't affect my every day life.  I see him this Friday and was thinking of discussing something to minimise the racing thoughts of ADHD during night time.  (Or, any time for that matter, it does impact quite a lot on my personal and work life). 

Currently I'm on Effexor, for suspected depression - while I'm definitely less happy than I was, it's more because of the circumstances I'm in with sleep and coping day-to-day with racing thoughts, so I may be weening off them soon.

The cholesterol is a bit high as you say. And with the higher end of normal with bpm and bp elevated on meds, is it good to be observant (but not concerned).

"8354","I have ADHD and anxiety. I was only adderall for years, and it did the trick for my concentration/functioning issues, but it caused my anxiety to worsen until it became my constant mental/emotional state.. which then turned into depression and constant anxiety, which sucked. I actually broke down crying in my doctor's office one day when I was trying to explain it to him and that's when he realized my anxiety was out of control and prescribed me with an extended release anti depressant to combat the anxiety-inducing side effects of my adhd meds. Anxiety and depression are common with adhd.

My general anxious-for-no-reason anxiety is finally gone now, but I still have many days when I get home and feel worthless, like some kind of defective human because I spend all day putting all of my energy into doing my work right and on time, and it's often left unfinished, and that gets to me. So I can understand.

But one thing I've realized over the last year or so is that people are genuinely amazed by the work that I DO complete, because it's so out of the box and above and beyond what the general engineer in my group creates. For the longest time, I'd do my work, and then sit back and think ""this is so mediocre and it took me way too long to create this mediocre thing"", but while it was mediocre in my mind compared to the masterpiece that my creative adhd mind had imagined it could be but couldn't focus enough to fully turn into reality, it's still more than what they could expect from the straight laced logical minds of my coworkers.

Some days are harder than others. Try and focus on the positive sides of it. Yes, it makes it way harder than it should be to do the mundane every day life things that our society expects of us, like getting a good education and holding a steady 9-5 job in an office and paying our bills on time and keeping up with the housework and relationships, but maybe the world is the problem, not us. Try to find a career that embraces your way of thinking instead of fighting it. Get a job where you are encouraged to be creative or allowed to move around a lot and work with your hands and mix up your tasks regularly. Have a conversation with your teachers/manager/family/friends and explain your situation (if you're comfortable) and that you work best in certain environments and situations, and ask for their help in some of it. For me, my lead knows that I can produce brilliant works when I'm passionate about something, but that I need almost militaristic oversight in order to manage my time and projects if he expects me to get it done. So we sit down together before every project and he helps me create a task schedule, and we have weekly meetings every Monday to discuss what I'm expected to do that week and I send him update emails at the end of every week with the status of my work, and I have a color coded task chart on my desk to remind me of the work that I'm supposed to do now, and what's coming up next, and then I physically move the sticky note tasks to the ""done"" area before starting on the next task.

There are plenty of things we can be upset about. It's easy to fall into the mindset that it's unfair that we have to live in a society that doesn't mesh with the way our minds work, or that it's unfair we have to have minds like this at all. I hate that I can't pay my bills on time despite having more than enough money to do so. I hate that I can't control my emotions and still pout and throw tantrums as a grown adult. I hate that I have to work so much harder to complete the mundane tasks that everyone else seems to find so easy. I hate that I feel drained at the end of the day because of it, but can't turn my mind off long enough to fall asleep at a decent time. 

But it's not all bad.

I love that I'm incredibly intuitive. I pick up on the details that everyone else seems to glance right over. I can read people and situations like a book and predict their actions.  My daydreams are fascinating and keep me from ever becoming bored, and my dreams at night are so real and intense it's like having a parallel second life. Speaking comes easy, and my intensified emotions make me a compassionate person (albeit a pouty one too, at times). My creativity is unending and has helped me succeed at my job. I get a rush and can be fascinated by some of the most simple-seeming things, because my mind sees them for more than what they first appear to be to the average onlooker. Boredom is rare and I am passionate about so many things.

But yeah.

What I'm getting at is that everything has its ups and downs. And despite the really hard ""downs"", I've come to appreciate the true worth of the ""ups"" for me. I wouldn't trade them for a ""normal"" brain if I could.

I hope you're able to find a treatment plan that works for you so that you are able to suppress the downsides of it when life requires you to, but still be able to harness and appreciate the unique positive aspects of your mind as well.","cm1igje",2,1415900323,"2014-11-13 17:38:43"

* 2nd Even if we did know some people try to cheat the system to score meds.  **I am not accusing you of this,** but just explaining one of the subredit rules we have on the right side.

* 3rd, In my personal non medical opinion, though it is shared by several ADHD experts that if you have a good interview and ask the right type of questions you can get a ""good guess"" if this person is ADHD or some other disorder causing attention issues such as depression and anxiety.  Yet you use this extra time to

 * A) Confirm your hunch

 * B) Identify strengths and weaknesses of the person for everyone ADHD and other disorders present in different ways.  You need to know the strength and weaknesses to create a tailored treatment plan instead of just handing him paper and say do these things.

 * C) Identify comorbidity, aka other disorders lurking in the background and may not be the primary disorder but are contributing to the decrease in the quality of life.  80% of ADHD patients have a 2nd disorder in addition to ADHD, 50+% have 3 or more disorders.  Other Disorders can be things like depression or anxiety, but it can also be things like learning difficulties such as dyslexia where you have problems reading, or other LD, or things that may not seem ""brain related"" but are actually are like motor tics, skin picking, etc.


You do a very **good interview** and you will save time and improve outcomes for the patient.  It helps you pick the best first medicine to try, it helps you figure out what medicine to try next if the first fails, or if you want to use an adjunct medicine to treat other issues such as comorbidities that the ADHD meds do not treat.  Furthermore it helps you identify non med strategies to compliment the meds so you are treating the disorder in a multimodal way.

Concerta is the extended release of Ritalin it is a stimulant. Please take the time to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEUtX7WZu2Q&amp;list=PLq7AkHopLIr8_1whMzHjqmamYDWcVcDv6&amp;index=11) video by Dr. Barkley it will give you a better understanding of the medications on the market. I would also recommend you go ahead and watch the rest of the 15 videos they are all very informative.

Just a tip try watching them at 1.25 or 1.5 speed it helps me pay attention better.

If you're just hyper focused what that means is you're probably just high on an amphetamine. 

The mess won't do all the work either, this isn't a magic pill, its an equalizer. You're working on stuff you know you shouldn't be? Get rid of that stuff. Lock it in your closet until your work is done. Your mind requires extra discipline and relying on the pills will not give you that.

  If you're on your computer getting distracted, switch to a notebook for writing. iPads with keyboards work great too, those no distraction writing apps are a godsend.

I don't really have any advice, but I can say from personal experience that at least some doctors have no problem prescribing ADHD meds to someone with an ED history.

I will say that it's pretty risky to take an appetite suppressant medication, so be careful. With meds I can go a long time without even thinking about food, and if I go for a few days without eating properly then the ED thoughts start popping up again. On the other hand, if I miss my meds for a few days, like if I forgot to get the prescription refilled soon enough, I end up binging, which is really unpleasant if you have ED issues.

2. Book an appointment with your psychiatrist. They ask for your referral, which makes you elegible for a rebate (medicare covers some of the cost)

3. Usually around 2-3 appointments you can get your diagnosis, then you discuss medication options.

"8515","My first reaction is that your ""focus"" is too much on telling her ""to focus.""  Maybe it's just how you're wording it in your post, but I'm assuming it is something you say to her as well.  This, especially for a child, can be extremely frustrating for someone--whether they have adhd or not.  Perhaps there were techniques that worked for you and your husband, but they might not be good for her.

Some constructive steps might be to keep exploring different types of projects for her.  Does she like doing experiments/projects?  Can she come up with a question that she has about science or history or anything that you could help her find resources or experiments to find the answers?  Does she prefer reading?  Or maybe if she has a question you can go to a museum or library to find the answer?  Or maybe she would prefer to make models or posters or videos.

My advice would be to explore her interests and start her off with projects she can be passionate about.  Get her to the point that she /wants/ to find the tools or work methods in order to get a result. 

I was medicated, then I wasn't, now I am again.  I have found benefits from both but most important was to ensure that I had some successes and then to reflect on how I was able to find success.  I was so proud of myself when I found topics to study that drove me to read articles and write papers without as much of that mental pain that comes with most adhd.

Going to public school while growing up with adhd was a nightmare because I was smart and interested but didn't fit in with the system or the normal tasks... I eventually had to cater my university experience to my own needs.  You have the chance to avoid recreating that frustrating isolation at home.

It Is good to reach out to this community, but if you wish to continue homeschooling, I would recommend doing a lot of research yourself on differnt learning and teaching methods.  Your own experience is often not enough.  

To reiterate, despite major pitfalls of public school, I benefitted from having a lot of different teachers, and from each I learned something different, something that worked, until eventually I would do things my own way (while still satisfying requirements and teachers).  

School becomes more willing to conform to your needs the further you go.  Help her find her ways of learning and proving what she has learned, and whenever she eventually does return to classic schooling, she will likely be able to make agreements with teachers/professors on how to tailor her education.  (Although it's hard to avoid having to take timed exams... Good luck with that one)

Buen suerte!  Education is an exploration of the world and a way to find how your passions, knowledge, creativity and ideas can translate into communicable and successful results.  Empower her!

"8546","I feel the same way with Vyvanse sometimes. It always works fine the first few days but after that, the side effects become more noticeable for some reason. Usually I'll get super irritated and I'll have no appetite for anything.

I asked my doctor for some Ritalin instead to see how my body works with it in contrast to Vyvanse. Although I don't get as strong of an affect (amphetamines are generally stronger than methylphenidate), it really helped to use it as a means of taking a break from Vyvanse when I couldn't afford to take nothing for the day. 

To give you an idea of how I've been using both, I usually stick to Ritalin for normal days when I'll have to go to school and get a bit of homework or reading done. I reserve Vyvanse (because of it's strength) for really busy days. 

My theory of why this seems to work for me is the essential difference between the two drugs. Methylphenidate acts as a dopamine and norepinephrine reputake inhibitor (it increases the natural, existing amount of these neurotransmitters in your brain), while amphetamines act as that AND it supplements your existing neurotransmitters (it adds to them, which is what makes it stronger). 

Talk to your doctor about these different medications and see if you can find a medication or plan that'll work well for you. Usually one or the other works for most people. Best of luck! ","cmdaap8",1,1416974545,"2014-11-26 04:02:25"

"8569","I‚Äôll read this in detail soon but PDT is not ‚Äùsimply‚Äù talking about something, thats the most common misconception. You work and analyze and trace things to get a clear view of what did happen. It‚Äôs more fuzzy but in my opinion it not only gives the tools to fix the now but also gives patients insight into old patterns that can help one foresee repeating them.

CBT fixes stuff, i cannot deny that, but PDT does too. Both are obviously developed to help and equip people with tools and strategies.

Where i live almost everyone who struggles with depression and anxiety, includingADHD folks get thrown into CBT and get 20 sessions to resolve their problem. If resources allow you can get an additional 25 sessions for that specific problem and the you have to reapply for a new problem and the be assigned a new therapist.

It becomes a systemic flaw that churns out fixes that don‚Äôt last.
You see many ‚Äùrepeat customers‚Äù who go for a second round and then people drop out, because they are still depressed and the proposed cure for whats ‚Äùwrong‚Äù with them seems to only last about 6 months until they run onto a new issue.

Please, dont jump down my throat about this, i did not intend to shit all over CBT or say its useless.
I stand by my experience of rewarding years of PDT and i still think that adult women with newly diagnosed ADHD can benefit from PDT a lot, because those two factors alone complicate eachother for many individuals with such frequency that it looks evermore as a structural issue to do with more than ‚Äùjust‚Äù having ADHD or being a woman in most societies today, which by themselves are reason enough for people to seel therapy.

The atypical brain chemistry also caught my attention because I've always reacted to drugs a little differently than my friends, but I'm not exactly a frequent user so I don't know too much about it, and further experimentation wouldn't really be a good idea lmao.

It's been a few months but I've only been on 50mg for a few weeks, before that I was on 30mg for a week and before that I started on 20mg but I didn't actually feel anything there. So that's why I'm scared, but if these honeymoon periods only last a couple days then I'm very hopeful.

I'm starting to think that it really is the extra energy that's making me happy. Maybe this really is who I am and I've just never had the fucking energy to be me. Who knows I guess, atleast I'm happier at the moment.

However it has temporarily made my ADHD worse in some regards, i.e. I am feeling quite lazy and monged out, I can't concentrate in conversations for more than a few seconds without my eyes glazing over and automatically daydreaming. But I'm like that often enough anyway. I am however already a lot calmer. Or at least everyone else who has seen me has commented on that. Also getting to sleep has been difficult and I've been noticing things like dry mouth and occasional nausea, in addition the general dazed feeling.

"8578","I'm 26, I was diagnosed earlier this year after I finally made myself go talk to doctors who took it seriously.

It's a challenge, but I feel really good about knowing, because I have a specific list of things I can look for that I know are my weaknesses, and plan around them, automate them, ask for help with them, or eliminate them from my day to day life. Just knowing what to look for is a huge advantage, and a lot of people don't get insight into their own behavior and motivations, in general.

I wish you the best. I think it's a nice feeling, but more people, attention deficit-y or not, never wake up and force themselves to be different.

Personally, I wouldn't specifically ask to be tested for ADHD, because you really don't know if you have that, and if the difficulty concentrating is something new, you probably have something else. If you haven't been sort of ""spacey"" your whole life, forgetting things all the time and whatnot, then I'd say that something else is likely the culprit. I would see a regular doctor, and explain the symptoms that you've noticed, and express a desire to see a specialist to figure out what is going on and what can be done about it.

"8606","If you use Google and Google Drive, try something like Google Keep. It's a notes app for your computer/phone/devices. It's real easy to open up, make a quite note and save, and then it'll be there on your computer later. Only takes a minute and you can do it whenever, which is a lot easier for people like us to manage. You can even make notes that are photos, so you could photo a note you made on a sticky or take a picture of an assignment grade, etc. Or, make a Google doc and keep a running list. It's a lot easier since you don't have to remember anything later or keep up with an actual notebook, and then when it's time for your appointment you can copy and paste (if you're using Keep and not just a doc file) all into one thing. 

So, from my experience... it's easier to go in knowledgeable and ready. When I'm getting ready in the morning and determined to have a functional day, I always put on makeup. I call it my ""warpaint"" (lame I know), but going to an appointment ready is kind of like that.

Both my kids are special needs with rare disorders, and the youngest is disabled, so I have a lot of experience with this. There will be doctors who never take you seriously and pass you of as a Google MD, so you need backup (thus, notes). Both my kids are separate indexed medical records binders I take with us to each appointments, and I stick notes in there when necessary. My older has a rare skin disorder that when improperly diagnosed for YEARS and we saw all kinds of specialists. It was frustrating trying to find a doctor who didn't look at it and go ""pfft eczema"" right away and not listen to stuff like he doesn't sweat at all, his fingernails grow freakishly fast, water burns his skin, and his skin blisters and opens to sores with no reason and sometimes just freaking COMES OFF. Like wtf how is that eczema (obviously it's not). Anyway I started keeping a dated record of symptoms, every prescription and OTC drug we'd tried and their side effects/whether they worked, every single one of his allergy tests and blood tests results, and a dated photo record (since so often by the time we got to an appointment his skin would be different). After I had that established we ended up at one of the top pediatric dermatologists in the state and they had him properly diagnosed in less than 30 minutes. It's both infuriating because it took so long (he's literally scarred for life now) should have been easy, and also finally a relief. 

I've had that sort of thing happen a few times other with both kids. I've been doing this crap for almost a decade, and that's not included a few decades of my own psychological shit. Some doctors just suck, and some really try to help but just don't know any better. 

Point in all that rambling is both you need to be persistent, but also go in ready for battle and not to take a simple no for an answer.

1. Dress well. It's generally safe to make the assumption that they'll take you more seriously if you look educated and like you at least sort of have your shit together.

2. Be confident. Don't forget your psychological warpaint, whatever that is. Remember your life is a disaster and it's not your fault. You've tried to be proactive, nobody is helping and you're just so fucking done with all of this and if they won't help you, find someone who will.  (Do you best not to be a dick about it though, that almost never helps)

3. I know it's damn near impossible for us to be on time most of the time, but do your best to at least not be late so you're not all frazzled and freaking out for being late. It helps to have few minutes before to get your brain online before you go in there. If an appointment starts and I'm not mentally prepped right before for it, I feel like I'm always a step behind. Personally I don't like having people with me at appointments (it's distracting) but maybe have someone who is an always-on-time person who doesn't mind waiting to go with you and keep you on schedule.

4. Take your evidence. I find just having that with me makes me more confident and less likely to backtrack and start second-guessing myself. I'm also really bad at remembering things so having all that there is a huge lifesaver. 

5. Say something along the lines of ""I have done my research, I am certain I have this problem or something like it. Here's is my evidence \[present checklists, diary, testimony from teacher, whatever that help substantiate your case, the more the better\]. It's been going on for X amount of time and getting worse. My life is a dumpsterfire and I'm about to lose my mind and I need help."" 

5. If meds come up, say you're aware there are lots of options, but it's overwhelming and defer to their judgement on that. (It might be a good idea to have some popular ones researched if you haven't to help with the discussion, but you don't have to tell them that up front). It might help to cop to self-medicating with Adderall from a friend, and say it helped, but you didn't like how it made you feel and ask if there is something different/better they suggest you could try. If you are on any other medications (like anxiety meds or antidepressants) you SHOULD mention that. Some people (like me) take a combination of things. I don't think it's uncommon to have a combination of ADHD medication and an antidepressant , anti-anxiety medication or mood stabilizer. Be open to at least hearing out those sorts of suggestions, but don't take no for an answer on the ADHD meds. Antidepressants or anti-anxiety meds might help, but alone they're treating symptoms, not the actual problem. 

6. I don't think you said in your post if you were taking anything else already? If they're willing to prescribe antidepressants, mood stabilizers or anti-anxiety meds (not xanax but the long-term ones), but not the ADHD meds, just go with it for now (or at least consider it and do your research), then find a new doctor. It might (will probably) help to a point, at least dealing with the psychological fallout. It could also help legitimize your concerns later with that or a different doctor if you can say you tried X antidepressant or Y anti-anxiety med and it didn't work, or only helped certain symptoms but not others.

7. INSIST on testing. It's a fair request. If they tell you they do not think you have ADHD, INSIST on them explaining exactly why they think that and ask for their theories on what you might have, and INSIST on their reasoning for those as well. 

8. Our memories can be shit sometimes, so record the conversation for your own reference later, and if you can, either record or write down your own thoughts right after the appointment, like sitting in your car or whatever.","eugqpew",1,1563813092,"2019-07-22 16:31:32"

"8613","Unfortunately what works for me might not work for you.

I have about 25 books on ADHD/mental health on kindle alone. Then more paper books scattered around. I've also learned coping methods from coursera courses. All of them contain various strategies. Throughout the process of reading, every week I'll try ~3 strategies and test it on myself like an experiment. 

Some general observations:

- exercise, meditation, diet, sleep hygiene. These are sacred. Try your best to not skip them.
- planning and organization: there's a LOT of literature on this topic. Don't get too hung up on a method not working for you, just try a different one. [Here's what I posted before on breaking tasks down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bxxcqg/making_todo_lists_causes_me_to_hyperfocus_on_them/eqag52v/)
- executing: Pomodoro's are effective. But what most people don't do is adjust the length of the pomodoros. Some days I can go 35 minutes, other days 5 minutes. Also find a small break you actually enjoy and recharges you.
- self care: There's a lot of misinformation with self-care. 
    - First, mindful self-care is generally better than mindless. Ex. yoga is better than watching tv. Really feeling the sensations of a shower is better than checking social media.
    - Second, there are different needs you have that you need to recharge. For each need you have you need to have a self care solution then schedule that into your calendar.  Ex. Need: social connection Solution: meet up with a friend for coffee, Need: mental stimulation Solution learn something new for 15 minutes, read a book etc.
- exercise: I think getting a 20 minute sweaty, heart rate up workout in the morning helps a lot. I'm currently experimenting with 20 minute HIIT/strength work in the morning with 20 min lunch walks and 15 minute yoga after dinner. If I had a choice I'd do a run at lunch.
- restlessness: This usually only becomes an issue if I haven't exercised but you can get a fidget toy or chew gum.
- sensory issues: Sometimes sensations can either be overwhelming or underwhelming. For underwhelming tasks ex washing dishes I'll listen to a tv show on my bluetooth earphones while watching or study with non lyric music on a loop. For over whelming you can desensitive a task, ex cleaning bathroom and wear gloves
- mood &amp; motivation: Left this for last. I'm still working on fine tuning this. This is a really complicated topic. 
    - There's the physical aspect of health, sleep, exercise, diet.
    - There's the mental health aspect of trauma, cognitive distortions, negative thoughts. I like CBT for this. You can memorize all the cognitive distortions and point of your inaccuracies on the fly.
    - There's the getting the ball moving in the first place aspect.

"8615","If you understand where they are coming from it's easy to understand why they feel the way they do. The normies will never understand why we are so scatter brained and well ... moody ... sometimes. They will not get that our desires to be good partners are overridden by our desire to walk around in figure eight patterns looking for cool little differences that might lead to food (sorry, that's a very specific example but I've got to make a connection somehow). Normies can't understand that. They can't understand how we will simply forget to bring in the laundry after we take out the garbage even though they asked us on the way out the door.

Normies can empathize, but usually people -- in general -- don't empathize.

What you reacted to is a very harsh statement by a very hurt and angry person. Sure it's out of line, but that person can't help the way they feel just like we can't help it when we go outside to perform a simple task and get distracted by the silver fish gathering on the fence. Or when we go out to get the mail we might be distracted by a story of the lone mailman who saved the town from disaster that writes itself while we are opening the mail box.

We are a different sort of creature and if the normies don't understand that when they go into the relationship, they are in for a shock. And since everyone paints everyone else in their own desired color, most folks are in line for a shock.

Instead of being shocked and hurt by these unfortunate souls, try to empathize with them. Do for them the one thing they can't do for you. Put yourself in their shoes and realize how much it would suck to be them. Then forgive them for they know not what they do.

That's what I've been trying to do. Especially with my mostly normie wife who is fed up with my shit most of the time.","dt2wozl",12,1516655878,"2018-01-22 21:17:58"

"8624","Substance dependence is when you need to regularly consume a substance so that you can function better in life than you otherwise would. There is *nothing* wrong with being dependent on a medication that enables you to live the life you want.

&gt;But I've also found that I just enjoy myself more when I'm on it.

|

&gt; Is this dependence?

Yes and yes. This is normal, to be expected, and *perfectly okay*. The point of medication isn't to make you a productive, robotic worker bee. Its *entire* purpose is to tune the performance of certain structures in the brain, to increase the effectiveness of your executive functions. These are used in *every* aspect of your life, and it makes perfect sense that medication would enable you to more fully enjoy things outside of work.

&gt; Is taking medication on the weekends OK?

Yes. Most of us take our medication *every* day. Our ADHD doesn't go away or take breaks, and neither will yours.

&gt; I became dependent on it

Dependency is *not* the same as addiction. We're dependent on our medication in order to function sufficiently in society, to make up for flaws that occurred in the development of our brains. Diabetics are dependent on their medication in order to maintain their blood sugar levels and not die. People with nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and other eye disorders are dependent on glasses, contacts, or other devices to help them see. That we're dependent on prosthetics and external tools *sucks*, because it can be inconvenient, but it's not *bad* or *wrong*.

Addiction, on the other hand, is a mental illness. It is the compulsive use of a thing despite the overwhelmingly negative consequences of doing so.

"8626","After you are done with the paper you need to see a doctor or a psych. 

I can not tell based off your post if you are diagnosed ADHD or if you are not ADHD (you took your friends Concerta and this is your first time with Concerta).


Chronic perfectionism causing the inability to start is common with ADHD but often is signs of comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, or some traits of OCD.  Comorbidities is when you have 2 or more disorders at once due to genetic factors, prenatal factors in the womb, or environmental factors after you are born.  80% of ADHD people have at least 1 comorbidity for ADHD shares many risk genes with depression, anxiety, ocd, bipolar, learning disabilities (dyslexia, bad handwriting due to brain stuff, dyscalculia, etc)

Now if its OCD, understand OCD is a spectrum disorder and it can be debilitating even if it does not match all the criteria to be officially OCD.  Very few people meet the official criteria of OCD only a few percent, but OCD spectrum disorders are in the mid teens for percent (depends on what you consider part of the spectrum).  Some of the ADHD brain problems are the same problems with OCD (and thus why OCD people have a high comorbidity with ADHD)

[OCD Spectrum Disorder](https://stahlonline.cambridge.org/essential_4th_chapter.jsf?page=chapter14_introduction.htm&amp;name=Chapter%2014&amp;title=Overview%20of%20impulsive-compulsive%20%20disorders#c02598-14-1)

You should really not take someone else's pills even if they are offered freely.  The vast majority of time ADHD meds are safe, in ADHD and non ADHD people.  The problem is we have no clue what dose works best for you if you are ADHD.  More is not better necessary for there is a goldilock zone with the right amount of dopamine and norepinephrine that should be between the brain synapses.  Taking too much dopamine can lead to a manic state, paranoia, extreme anxiety, a psychotic break including hallucinations, chronic skin picking which you can not stop, severe tics flailing of the limbs, heart problems and you get the point and I am describing the most severe problems to illustrate a point.

With ADHD there is a wide variety of what dose is best.  1 person of equal weight may take a dose 6 times higher than another ADHD person.  The reason why is we all have genes but we have different gene versions that determine the number of reuptake transporters, little vacuum pumps we have between the cells. ADHD people often have too many of these vacuum pumps and the ADHD meds block some but not all the pumps.  These vacuum pumps place the neurotransmitters in storage after the cell has been activated but with ADHD people they suck up the neurotransmitters prior to the cell being activated.

Well drug addiction occurs if you block all of those vaccum pumps related to dopamine, or if you block a substantial number of them (it starts around 50%, but the higher of pumps you block the more likely) what happens is the pleasure center of the brain is continuously triggered and you enter a state of euphoria, but you do not have to notice the state of the euphoria for it to occur.  Your brain then creates memories of the experience and your ""habitual"" mind which you do not spend rational thought on seeks out those activities.

Please talk to a doctor but good luck with your paper.","cmu6ghd",1,1418521123,"2014-12-14 01:38:43"

"8630","I am not and have not been in that situation, but it's been 6 hours since you posted and no one who has, has spoken up so I am going to go ahead and say something.

First, the past is the past. You can not do a thing about what has happened from one second ago backwards. The corollary to this is that the future, *your* future starts right now. You can change your situation, change how you relate to the world, and heal starting right now. If you mess up again, that too is quickly past and a fresh start is immediately available.

Second, listen to the psychiatrist and counselors who are there to help you. If they give you meds take the meds. If they give you mental exercises to do, do them. If sounds like you are already doing this and that is wonderful! Keep it up.

Third, know that you are not alone. Even though your particular suffering is yours, suffering itself is something we all go through and all have. Everyone goes through it. This is so true that Buddhism, one of the worlds major religions is premised on this simple truth. In a weird sense, suffering is a surefire way to relate with anyone and everyone. 

Fourth, because of the above point, a great way to help yourself suffer less is to find a way that you can positively help other people suffer less and then do that thing. Even if it is once in a while. Even if it doesn't seem like all that much, go ahead and do it. 

Fifth, give yourself space. This is something that I have found to be extremely important in my life. I have to give myself time to do things. I have to say no to social engagements, and even family and be by myself with nothing hanging over my head. Sometimes I even have to say no to myself when I get worked up over self-improvement schemes and want to fill all my time with ""being better."" No expectations. Nowhere to go, nothing to do.  

Sixth, and this is the last one and kind of an afterthought. The Buddhist who premise their whole religion on ""There is suffering"" have three other truths they talk about: ""there is a cause to suffering,"" 
there is a end to suffering,"" and ""there is a cause (i.e path) to end suffering."" I only say this because I know that suffering can feel overwhelming and like there is no end and can not possibly be an end to it. But this is not true. So don't let temporary suffering control and dictate your life.

It depends. I take a booster 2 hours before bed because it's actually easier for me to slow down/relax enough to fall asleep when medicated. It was a total game-changer for me in terms of sleep quality. I was chronically sleep-deprived before, had trouble falling asleep before 4 AM, had interrupted sleep, and was on various types of sleeping medication on and off. Taking a booster before bed was the first time I *ever* had a good night's sleep. I don't think my experience is that uncommon, I think some of the insomnia is just a manifestation of ADHD (and your symptoms, obviously, come back when your meds wear off). Definitely depends on the medication, though, taking my ER too late can lead to me not sleeping at all, even if it's still out of my system by booster/bedtime.

&gt; 
&gt; 

Just want to note: Psychiatrists are medical doctors. Not therapists. You don't do talk-y talk-y with them. You express your feelings, they make a judgement, prescribe medication, oversee how medication is working, tweak doses, change what medication you're on, write reports, and that's about it. They are not there to help you with your feelings, for the most part.

It's likely it's just going to be about how the medication is working so far, if the dosage needs changing, etc. Some psychiatrists do more, but emotions take time and that's not typically the job of a psych. It's not that they're not trying to help, it's the kind of help a psychiatrist provides is more medical-based rather than psychology-based. But if he suppresses his family life from the psych then it cannot be addressed.

&gt;I‚Äôd like to go if he‚Äôd allow it, but I don‚Äôt feel he would. I could always ask.

Ask. Or try to ring clinic and talk to him, maybe. A psychiatrist could offer more advice on the effect medication may have, or his ADHD. Most will definitely try and help families collectively with these issues, but it's generally more brief comments rather than full therapy.

&gt;It seems to me he‚Äôs going down the depressed path. He called me this morning to say it was raining and we didn‚Äôt need to walk the dogs, but he was crying and saying he‚Äôs sorry and has no one to talk to. When he said that when he loses passion for hobbies or relationships or whatever that he just disengages, I told him that it sounds like that sounds like a very lonely and unfulfilled life.

Yes. It appears the same to me. It's complicated, tbh. I honestly don't know what happens from here. Your thoughts will just eat at you unless you find some way to control them. At some point, something just has to click and you have to really accept your situation and thoughts fully to stop them controlling you. But how a person reaches that point I don't know. Until then, they're just going to remain unstable.

I suspect even if he did open up, he has no clue what to really say. His thoughts are probably just a giant mess. It's likely he doesn't know what his own problem is. Goes back to trying to fix a problem when you dunno what the problem is.

I don't think he wants to lose you, tbh. If he didn't care he wouldn't call. Maybe he doesn't want his crap to keep affecting you, or he just feels like he wants change. Someone going through this phase will almost always regret every erratic decision they make. If he can't find someone irl to talk to, try online. Reddit is OK. The issue is that some people in this situation expect advice when there's literally none that can be given, except the obvious. Therapy for couples would remain my best suggestion. A moderated environment to talk, figure out your feelings/other crap. Or individual therapy for him to figure out what he wants.","eig6wh4",1,1552502621,"2019-03-13 18:43:41"

Mine at the moment are bouldering and futsal (indoor soccer).

Futsal is great because you have a team, a fixed schedule and it's a fun game so you hardly even notice you're exercising except that you're exhausted at the end of the game. I have never been bored playing either, there's only 5 players on the team which I think helps because everyone is involved pretty much all the time.

Bouldering is great because you can go with pretty much any person you know and regardless of how experienced you each are, have a good time climbing together. You also get some really nice dopamine hits from successfully finishing a climb that's a bit tricky.

But yeah I would say test out some other exercises that are more mentally stimulating and involve other people.

Your mother is self centred, wilfully ignorant, and clearly not interested in being educated.  
If she tries to push the SSRIs on you again I would suggest you refuse without a second opinion, because she took your other meds.  

Please also search and read through this sub on techniques for coping and dealing with adhd without meds. It can be done, it's not as effective, but there are still ways to help yourself, and at least you know you will be doing the most you can without the meds.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2w9uxp/tips_on_motivation_or_just_tips_to_have_enough/  

There's lots more! It's worth the research. Lots of people with very mild adhd do better following the above advice so they don't have to depend on a pill every day. As said, it's never going to be as effective, but even for the rest of us, half the work still has to be done by ourselves and cannot be replaced with meds anyway.

1. If I‚Äôm having trouble getting started I try to break tasks down into reeeaaaally small chunks that feel manageable and tell myself if I do 1, that‚Äôs success.

I must touch that rock, its cool that gravel makes bricks, does the wall suffer structurally if all the bricks line up exactly?

I had always thought I'd procrastinated because I was lazy, but after thinking about it one day I realized that I was trying to deal with the anxiety and pressure I felt.

"8722","There is probably some genes in common between ADHD and Autism since if you are ADHD your chances of being autistic are vastly higher.  Autism in the general population is roughly 1 in a 100.  Autism in the ADHD population is about 1 in 20.  Thus that is a 20 time increase in risk.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

With ADHD we know that ADHD is a communication disorder between your brain sites.  It is hard for your brain parts to talk to each other due to 

* neurotransmitter feedback loops being messed up so your brain can't generate electricity to certain areas of the brain

and/or (depending on the individual)

* genetic causes of brain development

and/or

* environmental causes of brain development, such as lead poisoning, mother smoking during pregnancy, certain cancers and infections, or the treatment of those problems.

"8726","- Everyone has set backs, what matters is how you bounce back from it, the more set backs, the more opportunity you have to bounce back and prove yourself. 

- You will build resilience beyond what you thought imaginable

- Write down your achievements, keep them where you will see them, remind yourself that in-spite of of your setbacks, you have achieved so much already (we have a tendency to forget this, it is VERY important!)

- If you fail (when you fail lol) think about WHY what you tried didnt work. Chances are it isnt because you are incapable, it is because you went about it wrong. One issue people with ADHD have with this is they will just keep trying the same way over and over and over. Dont, find a way that works

- There is no right way to do something, find your own way. Not only is this going to help you find your feet, this is one of the (many) things us with ADHD are good at, finding a new, easier, way to do something.

- Let yourself feel shit at a failure. Dont dwell, dont ruminate, but if you fail, it sucks, feel shitty for a bit, it is natural, but then go back and figure out how you can avoid it next time

- Work hard at finding strategies for you. Whether it is ways to organise yourself and time, motivate yourself, or whatever. And if not, treatment helps. It helps because it is what will help you not get depressed. I got to where I am pre-diagnosis, but there was a lot of struggle in there.

- THERE IS NO RIGHT TIME TO ACCOMPLISH! I have seen people 'accomplish' things young, and now their lives are pretty average, or shit, or successful still. I have seen people older than me finally achieve their goals. It doesnt matter when you do it, as long as you do. You are not beholden to any timeline other than how long it takes for you to do it! I know people who have gone back and studied medicine at 40! there is not right or wrong time.

- Cut yourself some slack, you have ADHD, it makes things harder. That doesnt mean you should use it as an excuse/reason as to why you CANT, but it IS a reason as to why you might take a couple of tries.


Honestly, if i let the fact that I was a little 'later' to accomplish things get to me, I wouldnt be where I am. I didnt even know about ADHD till this year, but I just kept trying. I did really badly in High School, I took the long way to University. I got into Law School at 21 (most people were graduating it by 22). I didnt finish Law School until 27. I am now 31, I have opened an interstate office for my firm, this week I am meeting with 2 politicians, and I will be doing some media work as well. My point is, it isnt when you do it, it is the fact that you do it that matters!

"8730","You're welcome. Also, being quiet and avoiding people does not mean you aren't ADHD. People tend to assume that if you have ADHD you will be overly excitable, talk excessively, etc. That isn't the case at all. One way I think of it is that some are outwardly hyper, some are inwardly hyper, and some are both. By inwardly hyper I mean that your thoughts are bouncing off the walls, instead of your body. While it isn't as obvious to those around you, it is just as debilitating in your life. Like you can't read a paragraph because your mind goes from here to there to somewhere else, and try as you might, you can't make it stop. One reason that I avoid people is because I feel very awkward, and I have trouble being present. Basically I feel like I'm bad company. Sometimes I can't think of what to say, because I was too busy going down a rabbit hole to really listen and comprehend what people were saying. ","d2g3p4v",1,1461552823,"2016-04-25 02:53:43"

"8733","On 40mg Strattera, 190lb (86kg) male. Been on this for maybe 2\~3 weeks? I started at 20mg per day, then doubled to 40mg. 

I too am experiencing dizziness and nausea. For example, I'm usually a rollercoaster junkie; or was whenever the family and I could go to one. The other day though, I got a little butterfly of nausea in me just from changing lanes. Never happened with Vyvanse. 

I would see if you can dial it in as such: 

* Have a protein shake or a SlimFast in the morning with it. 
* Talk to your doctor about halving your prescription if you're just 53kg.  The idea of 85mg makes my head spin even *without* the meds, hah
* Obviously, plenty of water, mind your salts.","giyn6vq",1,1610421837,"2021-01-12 03:23:57"
"8734","Caveat: Talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about concerns related to your medication.

Elevated heart rate is normal for stimulants like these. My psychiatrist had me send her my blood pressure and resting heart rate measurements, both before and after I started taking Elvanse, just to be sure it wasn‚Äôt putting me into any danger zones.

Without it my pulse was around 60+, but during the first week adjusting to the meds I got readings around 95 and 100 at the crest of the medicine. A dose of Lisdexamfetamine takes between one and two hours to fully enter your bloodstream, so you‚Äôll probably noticed your most elevated heart rate around then.

If you‚Äôre just getting started on Elvanse you might find after a few weeks that your heart doesn‚Äôt race as fast, as often, or as long any more ‚Äî which was the case for me, though it still does to an extent, especially as it‚Äôs kicking in.

Caffeine raises your heart rate as well, so two coffees taken with your meds probably isn‚Äôt helping! Maybe try changing the timings or splitting the cups over the morning.

Long term effects are trickier to pontificate about: let me preface that I am not an expert. 

While Lisdexamfetamine specifically is very new, stimulants of the same class and general mechanism like Ritalin have been around since the 50s, and are well studied and safety tested. As far as I know, there‚Äôs very little evidence for damage with long term use. But I‚Äôm not an expert, so you should ask your doctor.","gf5hqtx",1,1607505050,"2020-12-09 09:10:50"

"8747","I'd recommend you stick with Speech Pathology if it's interesting to you and you like it. I don't have a huge understanding of career paths in Speech Pathology, but the little of it that I do know is that there are lots of different ways you can use that qualification - I have a friend who is a Speech Pathologist who works with people recovering from throat and mouth surgeries to ensure they can swallow properly. A qualification doesn't mean you have to do the same type of Speech Pathology forever, it seems like maybe it's a good qualification because you could have a range of jobs under the Speech pathology banner.

That said, if you're not enjoying it, that's a completely different story. But I would worry too much about being bored by something in the future. If it's interesting and enjoyable for you now, stick with it. Once you're out and working there's usually (depending on the job of course) time to put into hobbies and things, so if you go through periods when you're not loving your job you've got other things keeping you interested.

Most of us have been programming for many years before getting our first job, even before college.

No it's not. You need to write more code. Most developers with a couple years' worth of experience can transition between multiple languages without much effort. This is a very basic skill that you *have* to develop.

&gt; How can I improve my skills?

Write more code, challenge yourself to learn complicated techniques and concepts, and then *use them*. That's the *only* way to become a better developer. There are no shortcuts or secrets or tricks. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a goddamn liar.","dqrn5qg",2,1512421646,"2017-12-04 21:07:26"

"8755","Yeah, it takes a lot of time. You've got to eat, sleep and breathe the language if you want to be fluent any time soon. However, don't let the sheer enormity of the goal deter you. There's tons of great resources online that make studying languages a lot easier (not to mention fun).

I've found using [Memrise](http://memrise.com) helps a ton, since it reminds you when to review old words and you can make up your own courses on the site. Plus, it's a fun place to study. I definitely recommend checking it out if you have trouble trying to bring yourself to review vocabulary.

Also, I like to journal once a day on [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com) in the language I'm studying, at least once I get a good grasp of the orthography (written language). Native speakers then review my entries and correct any spelling or grammar errors. It's a great way to practice and learn at the same time.

/r/learnjapanese might also be of help. They have a ton of resources over there.

Lastly, see if you can set up a language exchange between you and a native Japanese Speaker who wants to learn English. Meet on Skype even just on a weekly basis and spend half an hour conversing in each of your respective native languages. There's so much you can learn from actual speakers that textbooks don't teach. Also, the more practice you can get, especially in a casual setting where you feel like you're speaking to a friend rather than a teacher, the easier the language will come and the less anxious you will be about messing up. [Interpals](http://interpals.net) and [iTalki](http://italki.com) are good places to start looking. Another benefit of having a language partner is that they might also keep you accountable.

You could be able to comprehend, write and speak a very basic level of Japanese by the end of the summer at the latest if you get started now (I know this to be true, as I somehow managed to accomplish this basic level of proficiency in about a month). Just set aside even 15min/day before bed to go over a couple new words and review a few old ones. Gradually introduce more and more grammar rules and practice as much as you can. Leave your books and webpages open somewhere where you can't avoid them, that way you're constantly reminded to practice. It's tough at first, but eventually the connections in your brain will strengthen and everything will come much easier.

Hopefully this helps a bit! If not, hopefully there's a resource or two I've listed that you'll benefit from. :)

i agree.

after recently admitting that i was/am depressed i have found new ways to push myself out of the funk and actually get out of bed.

but some days (two days this week, which sucks) i fucking can't move. not anxiety, although i am definitely going through a stressful time in my life right now. not a lack of willpower. i try like a motherfucker. not because i am on the wrong path. i love what i do, what i study, and where i work.

everyone gets depressed sometimes, sure. having a low or bad mood isn't unusual.

but fuck, man. i'm not even 30 and i am *weary*... life wears me out. drains me. i lose interest in my hobbies and friends. i can't find anything that makes me happy or upbeat for weeks at a time.

after getting shitty advice and reading corny self-help books for years i finally caved and went on an anti-depressant. it should kick in after another week or so. hopeful.

and if it doesn't work i'll keep trying. try harder. try again.

what people really need to understand is that we *are* trying. so hard.

"8778","I like to write song parodies. Using same tune, and making it sound almost original. My wife's coworkers get a kick out of them when I send them to her, and I enjoy it. It's something I can only do when the urge strikes me though. I usually make up songs in my head to help remember what I am doing and stay focused on what I am doing at any given time. Some stuff I do on my own is easy to focus on, but I have a lot of interests and like you can never stay on any of them long. Often feels like my life is constantly made up of 5 minute half attempted projects, broken up only by work, family, and sleep. 

I carry a large size moleskine with the graph paper everywhere I go, I love designing things and coming up with cool solutions to thing, etc. It has helped me a lot because I can just open it and work on it till I lose interest, or have to do something else, but it is always with me and ready to start on again if the urge strikes. Maybe something like that would help, even if it was just writing down the outlines, then later the scenes. You could section it off into different ""chapters"" for each interest and just do a little at a time. 

I think with ADHD, our success is different from others in that it derives from chipping away at the mountain in short, swift blows of a chisel, instead of a demo charge normal people have access to. The passions and goals are still accomplished, just with a little more squirrel chasing breaks in between.

I take it at 7 in the morning then around 1 I was feeling down and lazy so my doctor prescribed me to take one 40mg in the morning and one at noon (probably a little too much mg for me as it gives my anxiety) but it helped a lot. You could experiment and get 10mg pills so you can play with the dosage depending on how you‚Äôre feeling or what your day looks like, for example take more in the morning maybe 30mg in the morning then 10mg at noon so you can still sleep at night then you don‚Äôt have that groggy feeling until later on.

"8782","To me the booster(10mg IR) is a very mixed blessing. I generally only take it when I absolutely have to. It fucks up my sleep and can kind of mess up my week depending on what's going on. 

Generally if I need a little extra pep at the end of the meds I will drink some tea or an equally small amount of caffiene right when my meds are timed to start running out. It really helps to avoid the fuzz head and lethargy. 

I prefer tea as it has some extra calming effects built into it over something that is straight caffiene. It also is fairly low caffiene content by volume so I can drink more then 3 oz of it to get the caffiene that I need. 

I also try very hard to avoid energy drinks and excessive caffiene in general. I treat is like a drug if that makes sense. With the ADHD meds I'm already on, caffeine becomes a pretty vicious cycle if it gets out of hand.","gsot83x",1,1617027068,"2021-03-29 14:11:08"

"8784","Hi there, I took Vyvanse 40mg for a year or so before deciding to dial it back to 30mg for my own sanity (not necessarily due to side effects, I just wanted to try life with a *little* less help).    

In my experience over the last 5 years of taking it (maybe more- I don't even know anymore), most of the adverse side effects like feeling jittery, nauseous, emotional, etc went away after a little while **unless I didn't eat around the time I took the pill** . Even now I make it a point to do this any day I take the pill because if I don't- all that comes rushing back within an hour.     

If you're already doing that, then I'd say give it a chance for at least a month or so. If you take it around the same time most days and make sure you're eating normally throughout the day (it will probably take away your appetite), then those side effects will probably go away. If they don't.. it may not be the right one for you or maybe the dose is too high.

Generally though: Structure is critical. Be stringent because most of the time you own't be.

Eat well, sleep well, exercise. The healthier your body and mind are the more energy you'll have - which helps a lot of ADHD.

Stimulants like caffeine are massive. Don't over due it and crash, I used to sip a single cup of coffee all day long (8oz) as the constant caffeine helped me focus.

Meditation supposedly helps, I've been practicing since before I was diagnosed though and can't speak on that. In general it promotes better focus through practice, so that helps.

"8804","Being ADHD and being smart are not mutually exclusive, always remember that. I had a hard time coming to terms with my diagnosis too (at age 19). I had always been a straight A student and I didn't have many problems until I got to college and all the structure/routine that kept me going fell away. But, luckily for me, the specialist who diagnosed me was also a badass, highly intelligent and accomplished women who *also had ADHD*. She confided in me that I reminded her a lot of herself and explained to me that *so* many people with ADHD were incredibly intelligent people- in fact, she said that some aspects of ADHD could be a blessing so long as the negative aspects are minimized. The ability to hyperfocus and the tendency to strive for perfection helped me a great deal in college. I'm about to graduate undergrad with a 4.0 and I'm actually a very competitive applicant for the highly selective PhD program I'm looking at. That may not have been the case if I had felt resigned to the ADHD/unintelligent stereotype. 

You have to be honest with yourself about the bad *and* the good. ADHD leaves me feeling very overwhelmed with life and responsibilities. I have a lot of anxiety, I'm often forgetful, and I've probably lost every to-go coffee mug I've ever had. But I'm absolutely *not* unintelligent.

Or obviously with video games gaming together is a good lol. Grab lunch together. Go fruit picking. Go for a hike. Most people just want to be invited.

"8826","Okay, I have watched the video. First of all, I acknowledge that you are not trying to argue that ADHD is not a legitimate problem that causes people suffering. In your post and description of the video you seem professional and not specifically ""anti-ADHD"". However, you are **very** rude in the comments. If you were a good scientist and just in general a professional human being, you would have given explanations of your reasoning and pointed people towards the evidence/arguments instead of straight up insulting them. 

What do you even want to achieve by posting this here? I could understand it if you just wanted to raise awareness of this standpoint and to convince us of it, but your behavior in the comments speaks otherwise. 

Now, about your video. You say that there is not sufficient evidence that ADHD is a neurological disorder and that ADHD is not rooted in biology. Instead you suggest that some people have a higher arousal-threshold mainly because of dopamine. Isn't this a biological difference? Finally you argue that instead of medicine, people with ADHD should just find the thing that they find really interesting, because that will arouse them and they'll be able to focus on that. All very well, but what do you propose for the rest of these people's lives? How should they clean their house, do their taxes, and other boring but necessary tasks? And I'm not even talking about the fact that people with ADHD often don't hold the same interests for very long and spend their life jumping from one thing to the other. Plus, on your view, I would not even be able to reach a place where I would thrive doing something I love, because I am currently only doing very well in my study thanks to my medication. I wouldn't have been able to go to university without meds (I can show you the improvement in my grades when I started taking them). 

Oh and also, you say that you are very credible and that you cite around 30 articles. The way you do that, however, doesn't make it very easy for us to check them.

If you want your job to be easy, rely on the people who work on your shift and offer what help you *can* help ‚Äì malingering issues from staff are there because it's things they want but will never get. Don't promise the moon if you don't have a spaceship. Instead, try and offer them what you can (you don't have a rocket ship to get to the moon, but you do have a car to get em to the other end of town, if that helps. This metaphor is getting carried away though.)

&amp;#x200B;

I screwed up because I have a short fuse with anyone superior to me (I'm sure it probably could be diagnosed as ODD if getting that diagnosis means anything in practical terms) and while a good boss will listen to your frustrations and let you vent, they will not tolerate outright anger. Don't try to get to mucked up in office politics, either - at higher levels all the senior management come to the same meetings in the same room, and even if you've been calling out a manager from another department and your manager knows you're right, you're never gonna get promoted to sitting in those meetings because you aren't polite enough. That's advice I'd give myself, it may or may not help you.

&amp;#x200B;

Give yourself 6 months. Try and track how you're doing. Don't overthink what it means to manage or supervisor people ‚Äì there's no need for you to come in day 1 with some plan on how to make your team work better. Until you come to grips with the core responsibilities of your job, for now, your responsibility to them is to maintain the same incidental support their previous supervisor provided.","epy5cox",1,1559619925,"2019-06-04 03:45:25"
"8842","I started at 40 too and I've taken Adderall and Ritalin for over 10 years now.

I was extremely careful and took data before I started to get a baseline.   I did this for two weeks, rating myself morning noon and afternoon on how well I was focusing.  This way I could tell if the Medication worked and at what disafe.

Here is what I learned:  

1 common adderall/Ritalin dosing is TOO HIGH.   I was noticing effects at 5mg, where a typical dose is 20mg.  

2 best effects for me were in the morning.  Trying to keep going through the late afternoon just doesn't work that well and taking too late interferes with sleep

For the above two reasons. I prefer simple pills vs the timed release.

When I started, I would take 5mg at 8am, 5 at noon, and 5 around 3pm if I needed it (based on the type of work), so no more than 15mg per day.   This TRANSFORMED my work.   It has been a career saver.   

In the last year, I've moved to taking 10mg at 8am and 5 at 1pm if I need it, which is seldom.   I just do my non concentrating work in the afternoon (emails, meetings, etc)   BTW i am a computer programmer

In addition to medication, make sure you have a todo management system that systematically removes old items.   I used Mark foresters auto focus 4 for a few years with good success.   I use a home grown system now that borrows from AF4

"8849","Question: Are you a woman? Women are much more likely to be wrongly diagnosed with a mood disorder than men are, and much less likely to get diagnosed with ADHD. I‚Äôm AFAB and I literally got diagnosed with BPD at age 8 because the school psychiatrist was dead set on it being a mood disorder instead of ADHD. I ran with that dx for years and because of it never even considered ADHD until I was well into college. 

That said, apart from mood dysregulation, BPD comes with very distinct ups and downs that sustain themselves far longer than ADHD-related mood swings. With ADHD, something triggers an avalanche into a bad mood, but you fall asleep and the next morning your mood is more or less level again. With BPD, you get distinct and long lasting highs and very dramatic lows that can last for weeks. Mood swings in people with ADHD, like most other things in people with ADHD, are fickle and tend to be related to immediate triggers rather than sustained mental states. 

It‚Äôs also worth noting that Abilify has a documented history of preventing BPD-associated mania, but doing little for depression. Also important to note is that like most anti-psychotics, Abilify tends to decrease dopamine activity in the brain. This is an issue if given to patients with ADHD, because ADHD is a documented dopamine deficiency. I would definitely talk to a different doctor about adjusting your medication, but also be aware that when you‚Äôre just starting stimulants for the first time, there‚Äôs a honeymoon period where your brain is like, ‚ÄúYay! The dopamine I‚Äôve been craving is finally here!‚Äù but then eventually starts to adapt to it and attempt to return to ‚Äònormal‚Äô, so I wouldn‚Äôt discount the use of other kinds of anti-depressants in the future.","g2zftiu",2,1598497462,"2020-08-27 03:04:22"

"8863","&gt; They don't want kids going around thinking something is wrong with them [...]

There's an interesting book that came out a few years ago about the reading brain. It's called *Proust and the Squid.* It's pretty technical in parts and makes for some heavy reading, but it's very good. The last part of the book talks about dyslexia and what scientists have learned. Now, I'm sure what the book states is not a completely settled matter. It may even be controversial in some circles. But here was my takeaway. 

The environmental (or cultural) need to be literate is a very recent phenomenon in human history. It probably wasn't until about 75 or 100 years ago that an individual would have a real problem if he or she had a problem reading. It's only within the last 75-100 years that reading is almost a basic requisite for survival (in Western culture). For almost all of human history, this was not so. 

What's the upshot of this? There has never been (and, for all practical purposes, is not now) any *environmental* pressure that would cause human beings to evolve a reading brain. The book talks about the skill of reading being a re-purposing of various areas of our brain, working in coordination, to effect reading and reading comprehension. We didn't evolve to read. We didn't need to. Our brains evolved for other purposes, and mankind developed reading *as a technology.* 

So, there's no reason to believe that the ability to read, and read well, is something that should exist across 100% of the human population. Until the last 75-100 years, that has not been a problem. No one ever thought there was something ""wrong"" with someone who suffered from a processing problem when it came to reading. It's only *now* that we've identified these individuals and, because they're unlike others, have decided that there's something ""wrong"" with them.

Now, that doesn't make their dyslexia go away, but it puts it into perspective. Suppose‚Äîjust to make a really fanciful example‚Äîour culture changed for some reason to where piano playing became critical to survival. All of us walking around now who could not, for the life of us, learn to play the piano don't consider ourselves ""abnormal"" or suffering from some kind of deficiency; nor do we think of piano players as somehow more ""normal."" That's analogous to dyslexia.

Let's take a less fanciful example: imagine computer programming became a basic skill in modern society. Talk to someone who programs (for real, not HTML or some high-level language). They'll tell you that there are some things in programming that some people just don't get‚Äîand won't.

In some respects it's a scary sort of thing to consider, because the author was not hopeful that there would ever be a therapy or intervention that would somehow ""cure"" dyslexia. But I think we have to open up our minds. We, as human beings in the modern world, are changing our environment faster than any other animal‚Äîhuman beings included‚Äîhas ever had to deal with before. Isn't it possible that there are profound intellectual differences among individuals that will result in some people having a harder time than others in our changing world, and through no fault of their own, and certainly not because of any ""abnormality"" or ""deficiency""? I think so.

And just to sum up, I think this might very well apply to ADHD as well. The great mass of humanity never sat in cubicles or student desks 8 hours a day, and got along fine. Now that we're forcing so many to live in and work in a way that was never standard across human history, we shouldn't be surprised that some are less successful than others. We ought to stop trying to figure out what's ""wrong"" with these people and instead figure out what they ought to be doing to flourish with the skills they have.","c7uoqpw",2,1357856044,"2013-01-10 22:14:04"

You can also skim chapters, looking for diagrams, etc, as these often are used to explain difficult concepts. If you find a diagram, look for the paragraphs that reference it.

Another scheme is binary search. Read the first and last of a book, then pick the middle, then the middle of each half. Using this you can quickly get a lay of the land and a feel for the book, it's orginization, and how useful it may be.","gaads8f",1,1603817126,"2020-10-27 16:45:26"

Yes, she's had a rough year but she's holding everyone back from performing at their best although it's unintentional.

"8932","If the DR you are going to right now is not a licenses psychiatrist, he cannot prescribe medications for ADHD or anxiety. For treatment specific to issues categorized under mental health, you must seek assistance from a licensed psychiatrist able to prescribe medication. Most healthcare networks make it easy to find one specialized in ADD/ADHD.

Discuss your concerns with an experienced physician, ask about medications as well as other possible conditions. You should have no trouble getting guidance that way.

As I said, ask about medication for ADD and Anxiety. Prozac and Adderall for example work great on calming your mind so that you can focus on one task at a time. Prozac in particular also helps to deal with depression and obsessive compulsive behaviors.

I would not be surprised if you see major improvements after getting onto a treatment plan.

As a final note, don't focus too much on an Add diagnosis. The amount of sudden and spontaneous shifting you are describing sound more like compulsive or manic behavior. While both of these can occur in people suffering from ADD/ADHD, anxiety, depression, etc. They can also occurred in individuals suffering from a host of other disorders, including Autism, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, etc. I'm certainly not suggesting you have any of these, but until your diagnosis is confirmed and ALL of your symptoms addressed, I wouldn't go so far as to limit your issues to just one specific thing.","fa01o0t",1,1575747787,"2019-12-07 19:43:07"

"8936","First:  You're being really aggressive.  Keep in mind that /r/ADHD strives to be scientifically sound, so if you make claims that something can improve someone's quality of life, you *need* to be prepared to back up those claims with reputable peer-reviewed sources, and you certainly need to not be hostile when asked to provide those sources.

Second:  I have a background in science.  I know what journal paywalls are, and they're a giant pain in the butt.  But I also know that any reputable journal will provide a lengthy abstract that will tell you the premise and basic conclusions of any studies you are interested in, if not the exact data.  I consider that good enough because most people at home can't get behind a paywall, either; they're basically reserved for those at a university or an appropriate job.

Third:  [Is this perhaps what you were looking for?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2276739/)  I'm out of school and out of a job, so again, **I understand the issues with paywalls.**  That said, this particular study isn't behind one.  If you can't provide a link to even the abstract, you could at least provide the article title, author(s), year, and journal.  I can't find anything with the exact title mentioned in that SleepDex article.  If it was this article (Sobanski et al 2008) I think you need to give it another read.  A regular dosage of methylphenidate (Ritalin) at an unspecified time of day helped them out, not a dose of Adderall just before bedtime.","cpv4sbm",3,1427683144,"2015-03-30 02:39:04"
"8937","Also important to remember, with many medications the dosage may need to be adjusted as you age.  I used to take Ritalin (from 16 to 22) and as I grew and adapted to it, the dosage had to be regularly increased.  When I turned 22, I switched to Adderall.  I've needed to adjust it also, but not as much.  I would guess this is probably more to do with the fact I wasn't growing as much after 22 (which is a good thing, as I'm not small).","ec96sn3",2,1545405676,"2018-12-21 15:21:16"

I'm still able to pick up information and understand it, but I think my full understanding is greater on meds because rather than think ""ooo shiny new info *throws back* wait a minute this new one and and old one connect let's look at that *cue tangent*"" my brain is now more ""oh shiny thing *looks at it for a little longer before throwing it back*"" 

So in that way it feels slower but better.

 My verbal processing is better. I can hear more of what my professors say now rather than missing a full word or sentence here there while I'm spaced off in my brain.

"8969","&gt;* Are meds just treating the symptoms, rather than us attacking the underlying conditions?

I'm not anywhere near being an expert in meds, but if I remember the ELI5 I got once correctly: one aspect of ADD is not enough dopamine getting to where it needs to go, so meds try to fix that: with amphetamines it increases the amount of dopamine, and with ritalin style meds they do something with the reuptake inhibitors.  So they do sort of treat the underlying conditions, but it's more of a patch instead of replacing the broken part. (anyone who knows about this feel free to correct me on anything)

&gt;* Any tips for accountability? I've been looking for support groups here in Seattle, but not having much luck.

I think IRL support groups have been struggling and/or have dried up entirely in some areas with the advent of the internet.  Check out CHADD if you haven't already, they may run support groups in your area.

&gt;* How do you all keep from getting down on yourself? Feeling like you're not making enough progress, slipping up, etc.

This is probably the hardest thing.  I still struggle with it.  The best things to do I've found so far are: to remind yourself of what you've gotten done, to try to keep in mind that you *do* have a disability, so don't punish yourself for not behaving like a neurotypical person, and the cardinal rule, don't compare yourself with other people.","dfpha2p",11,1491085082,"2017-04-01 22:18:02"

"8984","I'd recommend doing a bit of research of other productivity apps that have been shared on this subreddit (other apps users have found useful), not only to get inspiration for what they want/use, but also how their different layouts are done.

Suggestions: Pomodoro, Habitica (checklists really help making a user feel great about doing a task, and checking off everything in a day is the best feeling!!), MyHomework (recurring tasks based on schedules), Google Calendar, Todoist, etc.

My other advice would be to be wary of trying to stuff everything in one place, or the app itself will become overwhelming. The user needs a reason to keep checking the app and input their daily/weekly plan in it, without the app starting to feel like their slave-master ;)

The more the app is going to allow the user to automated the reminders, the more it might feel like you have to program everything and become overwhelming at the beginning. Design your app so that it can be easy to start small &amp; so that the app will be useful even if you only start using one feature. Trust that with hyper-focus, a user that's already familiar with the app will probably end up researching all the features over time!

Lastly, if your app gets anywhere near complex, a Wiki. Sometimes it can be hard to see how to customize the app to fit your needs, and a wiki can show great examples. The Habitica wiki showed flossing as an example daily task, and I'm pretty sure 20% more habitica users floss regularly compared to the average population!","d3bsium",1,1463676862,"2016-05-19 16:54:22"

"8993","In some people being diagnosed ADHD is part of the stages of grief.  Your body and brain experience a loss that it thinks it can not recover from and thus it goes through the stages of grief.  Now it does not matter that you have always been ADD/ADHD, does not matter it has always messed up your life.  Your brain deals with things that are on its **time and thought horizon** and as soon as your brain *perceives* the change it now *experiences* the change.  Thus you may be in the depressed stage of grief, after years of denying you are ADD, getting angry at yourself for ADD, trying to bargain with yourself you are ADD (I can not be ADD because I can do X, or if I do these 5 things each day I will not be ADD).

Stages of grief

1. Denial
2. Anger
3. Bargaining
4. Depression
5. Acceptance

Now that you been diagnosed, it just hurts.  Understand running from the hurt will not make it go away, instead you need to embrace the hurt and learn to tolerate the hurt.  Accept that being ADD **SUCKS**, but you will succeed despite being ADD.  That you are still strong, talented, and compassionate.  You still have those support mechanisms, and you can have a happy life despite being ADD.  Now that you know you are ADD there are many things you can do to limit the damage ADD does.  You may not be able to cure ADD but you can put it into remission, kinda like a diabetic can treat the diabetes with artificial insulin.

Oh lots and lots of hugs, and comforting things like bubble baths also help :)

In other words this would be a good time to read books or watch videos that are proactive on what you can do with ADHD.  Not to learn more about the disorder, but instead learn more about what you can do to treat the disorder.

But there are probably reasons why this is happening, a doctor will be best at answering this.  Before I can give you more ideas though.

**What is your stress level?** How about sleep, and diet?

For if you are exhausting yourself it could very well explain your reaction.  Your body is trying to use energy, the ADHD meds help it trying to use energy, but if you have no energy due to other reasons like blood sugar or sleep you then hit a brick wall.  For many things are necessary for energy, motivation, mental clarity, working memory, etc...all stuff in the frontal lobe.  The neurotransmitters are just the first line messengers, you also need second line messengers, which then trigger what your body really wants like get more oxygen, or more blood sugar to your brain in these regions.

Now just because you have plenty of oxygen or plenty of blood sugar in your body, your body does not use it correctly unless your neurotransmitters are balanced, there job is to tell the body where to send this stuff and how much.  If they are out of balanced your body will not do this for it tries to conserve energy and resources and not be wasteful.  When people say they have a high metabolism there body is either doing one of two things.  1) It is being very in-efficient, but it does not mind doing so for you have plenty of resources coming in, or 2) Your body is very efficient at identifying things to spend resources on and thus your body always asks for more and thus you are always eating and such.  It is the neurotransmitters job to tell the body how much it wants, but also where to send it.","cprkczi",2,1427390653,"2015-03-26 17:24:13"

"9027","*At therapeutic dosages it is very rare to have neurotoxicity.* **It may happen though.**  At much higher dosages it can be very common.  Also the type of drug matters a lot, as well as its delivery mechanism.

* Meth is more neurotoxic than Adderall or Vyvanse.

* If you smoke it and it then affects your brain all at once vs you taking it orally and your brain gets its slowly due to the delivery mechanism this reduce the chance of neurotoxicity.

* How often you take the drug (how many hours or days between) interactions effects neurotoxicity.

* ***Lots of other factors*** related to other chemicals, genetics, drugs, things in the body etc effect neurotoxicity.  Your brain has lots of protective mechanisms to prevent neurotoxicity, and neurotoxicity occurs when these protective measures are not enough.

The problem with knowing how neurotoxicity is that all those above factors makes studying neurotoxicity very different for neurotoxicity of a rat brain is different than a humans brain, vs neurotoxicity of other animals.  And since we do not want to ""experiment"" with the intention of breaking real life human people it is hard to know exactly the bright line of when neurotoxicity occurs for we do not want to hurt real life humans.  Furthermore we know that lots of factors influence neurotoxicity and two different people with identical circumstances may have different results due to the fact their genetics is different and it is also hard to control circumstances identically.

-----

**Take away**

* If you use the drugs as prescribed by your doctor there is very little to worry about.  It may be a very real problem but it is unlikely and even if it does happen it will be a small problem.  Remember there are differences in degree, something can be a minor neurotoxic which your body can heal from and there can be major neurotoxicity so while this is scary understand that you can be okay.

* If you are using the drugs at the dosages prescribed by the doctor understand we have studied these drugs in a controlled setting with thousands of patients in drug studies.

* If you are using the drugs as prescribed by the doctor understand that millions of people take the same meds every year so we know they are generally safe.  *Freak things may occur though we can not* ***rule it out***.

* **The drugs are not the same thing.** Amphetamine such as Adderall and Vyvanse is less neurotoxic than Meth.  Also Methylphenidate (ritalin and concerta) and Wellbutrin do not appear to be neurotoxic due to how they work different only the brain cells sites.  In fact it appears that these drugs may even be neuroprotective so that reduce the chance of neurotoxicity.  You may be more safe taking Vyvanse with Wellbutrin than Wellbutrin alone.  It appears this way with animal models but we can not say with certainty that this also applies to humans, for we do not want to experiment on humans in the name of science.

**Take away** understand life but especially science is about ""confidence levels"" we are 50% confident about something, or 80% or 90% or 99% or 99.999% confident about something.  Well we are generally confident that at therapeutic levels that these drugs are safe.  If the drug is generally safe but there are some freak side effects that we know have happen we would put something called a black box warning on the meds.  For example Strattera has a black box warning that saying it may cause liver damage even though we only have 4 *possible* incident out of 4.5 million.  I am going to quote Dr. Barkley from his book

&gt;Liver complications occur once in every million people treated‚Äî one to four cases out of 4.5 million treated to date (it was not clear that the drug caused the problem in all four cases). This extremely unusual side effect seems to result from a very rare autoimmune reaction to the drug in which the body‚Äôs immune system attacks and inflames the outer layers of the liver. To be safe, people with a history of liver damage or other liver problems may want to avoid using this drug.

&gt;Barkley, Russell A. (2011-06-24). Taking Charge of Adult ADHD (Kindle Locations 2342-2344). Guilford Publications. Kindle Edition.  

So while rare we have that warning on there so we can keep an eye on your liver enzymes and if they rise we take you off the drug.  We do not have such warning for  neurotoxicity with ADHD stimulants for we do not know how often it occurs, and if it occurs at all.  That said we do know the drug can be neurotoxic at higher dosages.","cp0xgly",1,1425229868,"2015-03-01 17:11:08"

I really feel like what they're talking about in the article is a powerful technique. Forgiving yourself is hard, but like any skill it can be improved with practice. The study they cite says that if you forgive yourself for past failures, you'll tend to do better in the future.

Rejection is just being told ""you don't fit here"". That doesn't mean you lack worth as a person, just that you fit better somewhere else. You can try to change yourself to fit if that's really where you want to be, or you can go find a place where you fit better.

I have very mild social anxiety (that noone except my psychiatrist believes that I have), because I have found ways around it (I am very outgoing). I had to work with simply having eye contact with people, and not before today at work did it feel like a natural thing. It's like the pills just made me normal. It's the strangest feeling. 

Speaking of anxiety, I've tried smoking weed a couple of times in my teens, and that stuff gave me really bad panic attacks. At uni I tried smoking again, and it gave me panic attacks that came and went sporadically for about a month afterwards - I wonder if there is a correlation between my reaction to weed and the ADHD as well (or maybe I'm just the biggest lightweight that ever lived). Had to get diazepam to even be able to sleep. Not smoking again made them go away, though.

Another thing I've found to do is keep a tiny pocket-sized slip of paper or notepad and a pen on you at all times (Do NOT use your phone notepad, you'll just end up googling the question anyways), and when that thing pops up you just HAVE to look up (because you know you'll forget to later) write it down and look it up when it isn't so intrusive to normal life, like when you have some down-time.

"9090","It's kinda tough because you are in college and you usually would want to use the campus' health services.  But they often times aren't very experienced in working with ADD (and may be suspicious like you mentioned).  
&amp;nbsp;  
My advice would be to look up a psychologist or psychiatrist in the area who takes your insurance AND specializes in ADD.  They'll know best how to work with you and get to the bottom of things.  
&amp;nbsp;  
About the stigma, I understand.  Lots of people have the same worries but if you find a good doc, they'll listen to you first instead of judging.  Try to have a list of common issues and problems you experience when go for your appointment so you can describe what's been going on.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So you don't have to say ""I looked it up and I think it's ADD.""  You could just say ""I've always had problems with &lt;xyz&gt;, but now it's getting to be too much and I can't handle it all.  I need some help trying to get a handle on these issues &lt;abc&gt;.""","d0kfk4h",1,1456899524,"2016-03-02 06:18:44"

I'm not sure what type of work Mike has to do, but I do programming and siting at a desk all day starring at a computer can be hell, even if you like the work.  I find that if I take a break every hour for 15 minutes or so and go for a walk outside or talk to a coworker about what they are doing on their project can help to energize me and get excited about work.

"9097","Same.  Never gave much stock in the adhd diagnosis i had.  

I was anxious. So i took anxiety medication for a while, but I wasnt always anxious and forgot to follow up.


Other times I was depressed. So I was prescribed depression medication, I wasnt always depressed and forgot to follow up.


Anxiety medication just made it so I wasn't nervous about not paying bills on time, missing deadlines, removing my fear of being fired etc. I was chill, I was failing at life, but I wasn't anxious about the deadlines I was going to miss.


Depression medication made me feel too much... Also made me feel ok with being a failure after the fact. I wasn't upset after I missed a deadline. I didn't feel like a failure, I knew I was, I just didn't feel self hatred for letting my house turn to filth, no self hatred for being fired... I didn't give a shit that I didnt give a shit.  

ADHD is a misnomer, hyperactivity is impulsivity in children.  It serves no diagnostic value for adults.

Are you impulsive, quit tempered, risk taking (usually with sexual encounters), restless mentally (bored or need to preoccupy your mind somehow all the time)?

"9098","I'm on Adderall and I've tried Concerta as well. I liked Concerta more because I didn't have much anxiety at all on it. I could sit and do something and be totally patient (very unusual for me). The only problem was consistency for me. If I took too little, I was SUPER moody/irritable and and sort of drowsy in a strange way. I almost felt like a different person. And if I took the dose that worked (I think 54mg?), it wasn't always that effective. 

With Adderall, I get anxiety on anything beyond 10 or 15mg (I'm prescribed 15mg x 2 a day) but now I'm so used to it I can temper it a lot just by reminding myself it's nothing &amp; by trying to distract myself. Sometimes, when I don't need to do much work or I want to be more chill, I'll take 5mg. I focus better on Adderall than Concerta (although unfortunately, it doesn't make me more patient), and I like that the medication doesn't last as long bc it provides me with more flexibility. 

I've never taken an anti anxiety medication because my family has had very adverse reactions to them before, so I'm too scared to try it myself lol. But when I switched birth control pills, I felt like a dark cloud had been lifted. I used to be a lot more anxious &amp; depressed back when I was on my old pill. If you're on hormonal birth control, it's something to look into, because the negative side effects can sneak up on your years after you start taking them. So I guess I'd say Adderall and hormones work best for me right now?

They see the ADHD diagnosis as a negative reflection of their parenting skills, so they go into denial mode.

My parents did the same thing with the test. Then apparently some parts of my test got lost, too, so the psychiatrist just said there wasn't enough evidence and she was done. I called and requested a different psychiatrist, saying the first one made me uncomfortable and didn't listen. I told the new one straight up that I don't have a relationship with my parents and therefore couldn't complete that test. I came with a bunch of research and a list of symptoms I identified with. You have to advocate for yourself and be firm; it's not like everyone with abusive/absent parents is just denied a diagnosis, that would be totally unfair. There has to be alternatives.

I'm hyper-verbal, so when we're getting to the parts about impairment of the internalization of one's voice into their head, I'm forgetting that I'm not a person existing in the symptomic ADHD vacuum being described in the video I'm watching. At the point that that trait develops in me, it does so in a dysregulated way. And while it exists, maybe due to co-morbidities or perhaps due to coping mechanisms developed from life experience, it's just this buzzing, incessant, drone of commentary with periodic, discursive spikes of self-abuse. So, while Dr. Russ talks about that voice not developing, I had to calibrate my experience to what he's saying, that the internal voice isn't going to be able to give instruction on what to do next, because my brain isn't well suited to the requisite pause and reflection that precedes decision making and the marshalling of effort.

"9199","I have most of the same problems. Sounds, touch, temperature, sight sensitivities. And yes. The vary by day/mood in some cases. I usually need perfect silence get work done and concentrate. I have tried music (with words and without) and white/brown noise and i just find perfect silence to be what i need. Many with adhd like the opposite. And depending on the content of my work, I can handle some noise. And yes!!! Sometimes I get extremely irritated if ppl interrupt me from my concentration.  I think it is because it takes me so long to get in the zone in the first place and when I'm finally there I'm engaged and getting somewhere only for that to be ruined in an instant to have to start the painful process of re-engaging again. 

I also think I hear things louder than others. Like I will ask my husband what that buzzing sound is and he cannot hear it. I hear all the random background noises and they subconsciously grate on me. Noise canceling earbuds were a revelation to me. So nice. But the only problem then is I worry that I will miss an important sound I need to hear. So I teeter between enjoying the silence and the fear of not hearing someone walk up behind me and scare the crap out of me.

But yes, touch sensitivies. Like if my husband is brushing his fingers on my arm or hand. It will drive me crazy and almost feels slightly painful. But I withhold from saying anything sometimes because then he gets afraid to touch me at all. 

And yes. If I am not completely comfortable I cannot work. Studying in grass sounds horrible. Grass is all pokey and itchy. At my work on days I have to wear nice clothes, i want to scream. I literally cannot work as well if my clothes feel itchy, scratchy, the material isn't soft, it's too tight, my shoes hurt, etc. If I could just wear my comfy clothes I could concentrate. And believe me, I have tried to find comfortable work clothes!;) 

I also am very sensitive to tastes and temperature. I eat like a toddler because anything that is bitter, has a strange texture (i.e. shrimp, mushrooms, mushy tai food, oatmeal) has multiple food types mixed together, etc., i cannot eat. It makes it so hard at restaurants. Some restaurants I can only eat like one thing on the menu, excluding desserts of course;) and I cannot tolerate cold temps. It feels like knives stabbing me.

Many ppl with adhd have these sensitivities, at least some of them. You are not alone! I feel like the pickiest, self-indulgent person around, but I'm just trying to limit my extreme sensitivies which serve as distractions to me. I'm not trying to be difficult bit I always sound like I am;) I feel your pain 100%","f4drm5l",1,1571546561,"2019-10-20 04:42:41"
"9200","Good news according to [this](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/hygiene-is-overrated/612235/) showering too much is bad for your health. 
Dermatologist and microbiologist all agree that we shower TOO much especially those who shower after exercise as well. Showering strips your body of natural micro bacteria like gut bacteria except on the skin. Most soap we use, and hot water kills all the bad ones AND the good ones, stripping moisture from the skin and  worse for those who moisturise daily. 
Our skin actually stops producing moisture because of the cream we slap on.
Instead they recommend washing your ‚Äúbits‚Äù every day instead. This was taught to me by my gp when I was younger as I had very bad eczema. 
To wash my underarms and private parts. I don‚Äôt need to scrub my body every single day. Loved it because I hate showering too.
Hope this will make you feel better about showering. Wash your hands thought because covid, otherwise just give your bits a clean and that‚Äôs it. Shower every other days instead.","go7pefp",1,1613901396,"2021-02-21 09:56:36"

""I need eggs and milk.  Ugh, that means to drive 20 mins.  I wonder how much petrol I have, do I need to go and get petrol too?  I can't leave the house looking like this, I need to have a shower and get changed.  My jeans are in the wash, I won't be able to find any socks because the bloody dog keeps stealing them.  It's 3pm, it's kinda late, I have other stuff to do, do I really need milk and eggs?  I have bread and cheese, I can have that for breakfast it will be fine."" -&gt; don't go to the supermarket and then hate myself because I have no eggs/milk.

In regards to the processes of actually going to get the milk/eggs... my brain has gone to mars and back a million times by the time I get there and odds are I will forget either the milk or the eggs (or both).  ""Do I really need to pay for parking, they can't give me a ticket if I'm out within 10 mins. Crap I forgot to bring bags again, going to have to buy even more, my bloody cupboard is full of them. I swear it's that cash machine that keeps flagging my account to fraud prevention.   Wow, christmas food is in stock already?  Ooo look there's an offer on xyz!    Did I need toilet paper?""  

As for the third scenario in figure 5, yes, I do sometimes do that because it helps me try to remember what I need and the most efficient way to get in and out of there (I hate supermarket shopping), except for the making a conscious decision about thoughts making me miserable and doing something about it.  I don't do that, but it's something that other people often tell me that I need to do, so I guess others must.  ""don't dwell on it, nothing you can do about it, let it go, focus on what you can change, it's all in your mind"" yadda yadda yadda

So I‚Äôll suffer headaches and worse vision in the short term but then my eyes will revert back to their normal and I can get by and manage albeit with difficulty. I would describe my Adderall the same way. Addiction is where you crave something and you experience negative emotions and physical withdrawals from not consuming it. It starts to affect your life and you start to feel like your life is meaningless without the substance. Maybe you even feel elevated on the substance and like you couldn‚Äôt live without it. I personally have never felt addicted to my medication. I don‚Äôt crave it and don‚Äôt have issues with stopping it. The dependence sucks because I will get tired and scattered again but I could also go without it just fine without having withdrawals and cravings. ","eakbz0t",3,1543321038,"2018-11-27 12:17:18"

That being said I think your life could improve remarkably by finding a sex partner who is like-minded. At some point, the right one will come around. However, if it's something that's not exactly our specialty, it's patience to wait for the right person. My solution to this was to have 4 sex partners (separately, but knowing of each other) over a long period of time instead of growing tired and having to find new ones. The relations however grew deep and meaningful. This helped me stay intact until the right one came along.

Working ahead because they‚Äôre bored, reading ahead of everyone else.

My experience has been, I‚Äôm really bad at learning basics of anything. I need applications, then I will learn the basics as I go. So taking classes a grade ahead actually helped me learn, because giving myself the disability of not knowing the basics gave me something to challenge me.

The problem is, that kind of stuff quits working when you graduate and get into the real world. There is no ‚Äúgrade above‚Äù in the real world. You could maybe argue that getting a random promotion is the same thing, but most people don‚Äôt have that happen.

I still notice it occasionally, but getting off Prozac helped me notice triggers. 

So far... Certain lights (ironically, doc office lights seem to be the *worst*), the weather, certain supplements (still figuring out which since I take multiple), caffeine, alcohol, and diet have had negative effects on my brain fog and energy. 

A few things I‚Äôve tried over the years that seemed to help with brain fog and/or fatigue...

-	juice cleanses (talk to your doc, and I also recommend buying from a local juicer with Pre-planned cleanses since juicing and planning for nutrients is a pain)
-	taking breaks from adderall for a few days at a time (also been experimenting with low dose on these ‚Äòbreak‚Äô days, someone mentioned to me they had a positive experience)
-	combining adderall and vyvanse
-	‚Äúbland‚Äù or alkaline diet (had a gastric stint in the hospital last year and was told to do this for weeks to recover, ended up unexpectedly feeling more naturally refreshed after a week or two as well)
-	working out or going outside for at least 10 mins
-	avoid alcohol, even in small amounts. Maybe I‚Äôm allergic or more sensitive than others, but even just a few drinks can noticeably throws me ‚Äòoff‚Äô for several days. I think my body was also inflamed.. I was a very light drinker throughout the week, but since cutting it completely out in January I‚Äôve still lost 10 lbs (I was 125, so didn‚Äôt have much to lose to begin with)

You can also go so far as to note the date and day of the start of your med cycles, keep a tally using one point per two week cycle, keep a tally of how many days you miss, etc. Lots of interesting data can come out of that if you're accurate about it.","daxuveo",1,1481206014,"2016-12-08 14:06:54"
"9273","You sound like you've struggled with some of the same issues I did growing up (and still do to an extent) I'm very impulsive and unmotivated when I'm off my meds. I was diagnosed with social anxiety and aspergers as a kid, which I instantly rejected the aspergers diagnosis because it didn't seem to really fit me, although I do seem to still have some  slight aspie traits. 

2 years ago, I read an article about the similarities and differences between Aspergers and ADHD. I definitely felt that ADHD described me much better, so I got a second opinion. My brother was diagnosed as a kid but he was hyperactive and I was mainly inattentive and I got misdiagnosed as a result.

I went to my doctor and she put me on wellbutrin. It helped with my depression but didn't do much for my ADHD so eventually I sought out a psychiatrist for an official diagnosis since my doctor couldn't prescribe stimulants. 1st psychiatrist didn't deny I had ADHD but seemed hesitant on prescribing me anything but the 2nd didn't have a problem with it.

Sorry, my response was longer than I intended it to be lol. Anyway, you should definitely get a 2nd opinion. Do you have anyone else in your family who has it or you suspect has it? Genetics definitely seem to play a factor. Besides my brother, I suspect my mom has it and my dad I'm 99% sure has it. ","e4w1ri4",2,1535328622,"2018-08-27 00:10:22"

It's painful having your self-value being based on your interpretation of other's comments because you end up being offended even when nobody intends to offend you. 

That's why this sub works like a temporary antidote‚Äîyou get external validation again but now positive. That's just gonna reinforce your need for positive validation in times when you feel invalidated, and the loop goes on and you keep living a life where you feel bad about yourself. 

Your current self-value has been learned from the time you were born. There are feelings of shame and fear deeply rooted in your sub-consciousness, and you're not gonna feel good about yourself until you untangle this mess without judgment.

That's what therapy is for. By having a second person asking questions, you can backtrack and revisit painful memories your brain has been avoiding for so long.

"9320","I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI and moderate depression back in February by my doctor. She gave me the choice between an antidepressant first or a stimulant. I requested Wellbutrin XL becuase it has been known to relieve depression with a secondary effect for relieving ADHD. It sure helped balance my mood but did nothing for my poor attention, so after a few weeks I requested Vyvanse and now I take both meds daily. The Vyvanse has helped a lot and I don't feel like the Wellbutrin has counteracted it. I've heard that Wellbutrin can ease the comedown from stimulant medications, but I can't say from experience because I know stimulant meds never give me bad comedowns to begin with. 

On both, my mood is stable, I'm a bit awake and alert and I'm able to stay focused on my work for hours at a time with reasonable breaks. I'm pretty happy with this combination!

That's what my adderall does.  It enables me to function like a human being, enables me to work and study.  It doesn't make me do those things though.

""Gonna play a round of COD while I wait for the meds to hit, then study."". 6 hours later im playing COD still saying okay one more game.  

I find it best to start whatever I need to do, as soon as I take my meds. Even if I am struggling.  I'll start studying right after swallowing my 25mg xr.  Before they kick in I'll struggle along trying to comprehend and focus on what I'm reading.  But when they kick in, I'm already in study mode, and I'm going full force.

"9360","Ha, yeah, that feeling like you've exhausted every option is definitely a familiar one.  Of course, I can't diagnose you over the internet but it certainly does sound likely to be tending towards ADHD signs.  

I think what you say about taking this post to the counsellor is a great plan.  When I first went to see professionals about my issues I had a million thoughts and so there were lots of appointments to even jot down what I thought my issues were (which all also went twice as long as they should have because I rambled so much, and then never got around to the original point I was trying to make, haha).  The sheer number of appointments before getting any feedback from them was frustrating -- it took maybe 3 months to just *tell* them what I thought my problems were.  So to have some structure to what you want to talk about is an excellent plan  :)

I think you'll find that even if it's not an ADHD diagnosis, they will be able to identify the ultimate cause of your troubles...  They won't just send you away to flounder in life.  Some other outcomes I've heard of have been people being diagnosed with a combination of anxiety and sleep deprivation which can cause ADHD-like signs.  And if something like that is the case, there are very effective methods to deal with that too!  And those sorts of diagnoses are often easier to manage too  :) ","dikjniv",1,1496824017,"2017-06-07 08:26:57"

Your point about talking too much stuck out to me. I have always talked too much. I also used to suffer from anxiety, which got worse in my early 20s in my career.

Outwardly however I know I am perceived as driven and confident. I am career and business driven. I know many people like this can have ADD. 

My job requires a lot of report writing and rather than do a little bit every day, I tend to sit on the work until the last minute then crank it out in epic sessions of hyper focus. I get 90% done but my attention to detail is poor. Like I have no patience to re read stuff so often have lots of typos. I have gotten better with this as do an extra review later.

"9375","Are you worried about failing due to the vitamins specifically? Or are you worried that the she will try multiple things to sabotage your diagnosis and treatment and the vitamins are just evidence that she has such a goal?

If it's just the vitamins, don't worry. It's unlikely that they'll provide any benefit, especially if you only take them for a week, but even if they do (which is good), the idea of ADHD is that it's a pervasive problem throughout your life. The recommended diagnostic process is a patient history and clinical interview, i.e. they discuss with you whether you have the symptoms, for how long and how badly, and rule out other causes. Being focused during and before the appointment is mostly irrelevant, except if it helps you communicate with the doctor better, that might actually help. However, if you're a minor, they might want info from your parents and teachers, and if your mom gives false or misleading info, that could be a problem.

There are some (usually not psychiatrists, I think) which try to base ADHD diagnosis through neuropsychiatric assessments. Being focused during those tests could affect your score, but those are stupidly inaccurate for diagnosing ADHD anyway. (However, they are useful for ruling out things like learning disorders, so it's not too absurd to involve them in the process at some point.)","dofhbbx",2,1508126645,"2017-10-16 04:04:05"
"9376","In the UK it's very hard to get diagnosed as an adult.

If you try to go to a GP (your only point of call in healthcare unless you pay large sums of money to go private), they'll quite often dismiss you and tell you to eat better, that you're stressed etc., that because it wasn't flagged up in your childhood (or if you're a girl not a boy!) then you're probably just imagining it. You can't just book an appointment to see a psychiatrist or psychologist specialising in ADHD - you have to get referred through your GP. If your GP won't refer you, you're stuck.

And if you want to actually see someone for therapy or prescriptions if you actually managed to get diagnosed (I was diagnosed through my uni with an educational psychologist), it can take years on the NHS - there's a 2-3 year waiting list where I am. 

So yeah, many people who suspect they have ADHD can wait for years to get a formal diagnosis, even if they're almost positive they have it. So telling people they shouldn't give out advice unless they're formally diagnosed is pretty unhelpful. There are thousands who almost certainly have it but don't have the luxury to have a formal approval from a clinician.","drqlrbv",2,1514209091,"2017-12-25 13:38:11"

"9383","I have problems with this too and most of the times I think the cause comes down to having ADHD. For example: having a hasty lifestyle kills many basic health benefits like eating, showering, brushing teeth. I choose to not combine too much at once but sometimes you don't have a choice, like during exams my hygiene gets pretty bad sometimes. Idk, I feel like showering is something I can come to when nothing else's left to do. Another related problem I have is getting up in the morning (which I guess is part off my executive dysfunction/having a hard time to do stuff that doesn't excite me) in time, so I hardly ever shower then. I shower in the evening but I guess for women just showering is often seen as 'not enough', so I guess that on most early weekdays I look messy and not put-together. I know it's partly just because of social norms but I do wish I put some more effort in my day to day looks. I feel like such a slob sometimes, I often wish I could hide in the daytime and then I curse myself for not doing more effort. That's something I really hate about ADHD, how it changes your perception so easily, if you'd ask me in the morning in bed I'd probably tell you I don't give a damn about what other people think (as long as I don't smell, have dirty clothes on, etc). I have felt like this since I was I child. Over the years I chose more for a tomboyish style partly because I can't live up to womanhood standards when it comes to looks.

Having this ability to TUNE your noise masking is very helpful....  And you can save your specific calibrations to a distinct URL you can then bookmark...   Then on top of that, MyNoise enables the ability to automatically create a slow-changing variable sound, so that it takes your pre-sets and adds a randomizer to those settings, to give your noise masking a bit of variety that can prevent fatigue.

I‚Äôm also not sure what you meant by my kind. I gladly pay taxes for public education, my girlfriend works is in public education, budget cuts would only hurt her and her students.

"9410","Thank you so much for your support. I know he loves me, and he makes efforts to make me happy. But there's the disturbing fact that the way he behaves during fights and completely ignores afterwards how puzzling it might be for me is completely beyond my understanding.

But we've both invested so much in this relationship. I have a lot to lose. A lot. I'm not sure I'll ever be ready to give up. There's no urgency anyway. I have to stay for now, it's not that bad, on the contrary, things are good most if the time. 

However my emotional detachement is wearing me out. I hope it eventually fades away like it did so many times. And I hope I'll find a way to make him really understand what troubles me. I really don't get what's been so wrong with my reasoning so far and how it can't seem to access the good side of his intelligence. I wonder if I'm stupid or something?

I admit I don't have the courage right now to risk triggering another fight. The last one happened because I let him a chance to understand something I have a hard time dealing with. I didn't want to have that conversation but I started it because I thought it would be good for us. It was a big effort. And it turned against me... I was able to stop thing from escalating because my medication makes it possible, but really I was so depressed, all I wanted to do was to go to bed and forget about it.

Archer posits that very few of us have a true neurological need to take meds and by reframing our mindset we can thrive with ADHD, with work of course. 

While I fall within the range for really needing meds, his book has helped me immeasurably and enabled me to not take my meds every day. My paradigm shift has changed my attitude, allowing me to ""swim with the current"" instead of constantly fighting it. HUGE difference.

"9440","One very important thing to remember is that pills don't teach skills. Stimulants can offer you the ability to focus but can't dictate where you're able to apply that focus.

Executive functions like task initiation, metacognition, response inhibition etc, at least in the traditional sense, will never work the same way for you as they will for neurotypical people. So you're likely to have similar results in this area regardless of which medication you choose.

I would recommend finding an experienced ADHD coach who can work with you on improving executive functioning. This will be a more comprehensive approach than say CBT or DBT which only works if you're able to recall principals in the moment.

There will never be a magic pill for motivation but that doesn't mean you have to resign yourself to a lazy lifestyle.

Others who get bored easily or who are very physical people may do much better with a physical/kinetic practice like yoga or even something like circle dancing.

"9459","A tip that works for me very well: when you find yourself unable to sleep due to an unstoppable spiral of worrying (in Dutch there's a word ""malen"" - the translation is ""to fret"" but I feel that word went out of date when Wham split up), it helps to

1. say: ""There's absolutely nothing I can do about that thing at this point in time (usually 03:00 am) - the best and only action I can take now is to make a deal with myself right now to take such-an-such action at the first opportunity.""  (like call the people from company x and make a deal to settle all your remaining unpaid bills in monthly payments) - and 
2. set a reminder in your phone.

repeat 1. and 2 until worryable issues are finished.

3. Sleep
4. Actually do the items you set your reminders for, even if the worrying seems silly at this point. This step is important because you need to be able to rely on the person you make agreements with next time as well. (this person would be you...)","crla38d",3,1432646127,"2015-05-26 13:15:27"
"9460","ADHD-inattentive.  

I am quick to anger, but my upset is usually extremely mild and it fades super fast. Like, I literally forget that angry feeling or what I was mad about 20 minutes later.   

Example: last week (or maybe it was a few nights ago), teenage daughter did...something (I don't remember what)....that made her dad and I pissed off. By the time she got home, I was already over it, but determined to discipline her anyway. By the time I woke up in the morning, it was all gone and I kind of settled into ""Eh, No big deal. No harm, no foul. What was it again?""  That is kind of how it always, always works with me.    

I call it my ""matchstick temper."" Quick to light. Tiny fire. Burns out fast. I just don't get angry for long. And I don't really get very mad at all. Things kind of just roll off my back.

...except when they don't. Very, very rarely, if something is HUGE (we are talking things like major abandonment or betrayal here) I get absolutely fires-of-hell incensed. But I kind of have been trained to shut that shit down. So, with me, if I shout at you, you know you are good - and the minute my mouth is closed, it is done.   

But, if I shut up, turn around and walk away, you know you are abso-fucking-lutely SCREWED. (and no, I am so not proud of this, hence the shutting up thing)","cii4rue",2,1403833170,"2014-06-27 01:39:30"

"9464","It is but it isn't. The way I see it, I haven't exhausted all my options yet. If I ever reach a point where I have completely screwed myself over, where there is no hope of ever doing what I want or living how I want to live then yeah, I'd probably kill myself. If the world is truly a worthless, pointless place, then I'll take my chances with the possibility of an afterlife.

However, I don't really think it's possible to exhaust all my options like that unless I'm doing it very, very intentionally, which I have no desire to do. Accidentally screwing up never completely destroys my life, even if I do it a lot. Right now I'm probably going to flunk this semester for reasons that were easily avoidable. I don't know what going to happen to me and I'm freaking out. But I'm still not screwed. As long as I can be sanguine about my situation I don't have a reason to die. I'm a mess and I'm not in a particularly healthy place but I have hope that eventually, I'll get there. I haven't experienced enough of the world to determine if it sucks or not, so I have to keep going to satisfy my curiosity.

"9481","Congrats on getting through the GRE! And you SHOULD be looking forward to graduate school, it can be an amazing time if you allow it to be  - my first year of law school I didn't allow myself to really enjoy it b/c of stress, and that was just a waste of time. If you don't mind, what type of program are you going into? 

You can definitely handle the stress if you are aware of it going in. It's all about mindset, really. It took 2 years of writhing around until I understood that. Yep, b/c I wasn't diagnosed until last year, I have to provide extra evidence since it looks like I'm just trying to game the system or something. Now, I've graduated without any testing accommodations and am staring down a 3-day (day 1 - 4 essays, day 2 - 200 m/c, day 3 - 4 essays), 13 subject test that determines the rest of my life in July...with no accommodations. But y'know what? My motivation is to pass without an accommodation even if no one knows but me. Passing is going to be my little private victory. 

Don't take grad school too seriously, and pursue something that you're truly passionate about. Good luck and if you need any advice/moral support, feel free to hit me up. I said it above, but it can get lonely being in grad school with adhd. I was so relieved when I found this sub. My 2 cents, and this is from my personal experience, don't tell anyone you have adhd when you go. I'm not embarrassed at all, but there is def. a stigma associated with it, mainly due to ignorance. (I was in a group and they were talking about how stupid adhd accommodations were and how someone with ""real"" adhd couldn't/shouldn't be there...I'm glad I kept my mouth shut)... This began to ramble. Time for my meds and to start studying haha. Cheers.

"9488","I get you. For me, I just had to observe my fantasies, what I found attractive, and what turned me on. An open mind goes a long way to finding truth, and I surmised that I am without a doubt heterosexual.  

And yes, your list contains several dead points for me - namely, #5 and #6. Fear of not being able to do something *right* keeps me from doing anything unless I know I'm with people who truly and seriously do not care how well or how poor I do something. In fact, this is one of the compounding issues that I encountered with my spouse - I started to view sex as just another session to disappoint, and the metric ton of pressure made my stomach muscles clench in pure anxiety, knowing that there would be no difference between me turning her down (again) or performing badly (again). The margin for success was so little that I simply prentended that this issue didn't exist until I absolutely *had* to deal with it. Needless to say, this is not how healthy relationships work. 

I also identify with #6 because, as most ADHD kids, I was constantly (or at least felt that I was) being harangued for things like ""inattention to detail"" or just being plain lazy. I compensated for this in two ways: (1) giving up completely on the task, no matter what it meant or how much trouble was to come, or (2) putting so much attention to making things perfect that it would take much more time than usual, and I would be absolutely devistated if whatever it was I was working on got anything less than exemplary marks. Hell, I have a hard time going to a new restaurant and NOT looking at everything on menu before ordering - just to ensure that I wasn't shorting myself by passing up something awesome that I didn't take the time to find.

Writing is an excellent way to work through our thoughts, because the situation is complex, and without seeing it laid out on paper, it‚Äôs hard to feel like you have control of it. 

Write down what happened, how it made you feel, whether or not you should still feel this way, write down whether or not you have done similar things in the present, and whether or not a repeat is likely.

"9572","I would have loved for my parents to help me with planning and time management. I always procrastinated on big projects in school because I couldn't figure out how to break them down.

Be careful with sports activities with school. My parents wanted me to take college classes, practice my sport everyday, read, etc, etc in high school. (I was undiagnosed at this time so it was especially overwhelming.) In other words, check in with him about his limits or if he is feeling like it's too much. For me, my parents' unrealistic expectations really got the downward depression spiral going where I would obsess over not being good enough.

Routines are really helpful, especially in the morning. If he develops a routine on his own that works, try and be understanding if he gets upset if this routine gets disrupted. Although, I'd talk to him about communicating better when upset if necessary.

Try not to disrupt hyper focusing, it feels like you are mentally ripped from a task like ripping apart velcro for one. For two, it's really helpful for completing tasks. Instead, encourage him to pay attention to how he gets to the hyper focus state so he can recreate it. Be understanding about irritability after a hyper focus session, but help him understand how to make the transition easier. Also, help him learn to overcome or deal with overstimulation.

Overall, just help him find his own ways of doing and managing things so that he can keep track and do things on his own. Help him take advantage of the positives and attributes of ADHD. I.e. Take advantage of ADHD observation of new things, by strategic placement of objects notes so that he gets necessary tasks done, but keep mixing things up so they still get noticed. Watch out for those pesky downward depression spirals, and teach him how to deal with them effectively. 

(The downward depression spirals are when one thought of not living up to expectations or one downer thought gets perpetuated in the racing ADHD web thinking mind and can get to the point of suicidal thoughts. An example would be I didn't do well on test x, also messed up activity y, I can never keep up with z, [...] I can't do anything right. Everyone hates me! and other irrationally depressing thoughts.) 

I hope this helps! 

**TL;DR Help him organize, plan, and break down projects into manageable pieces. Help him use ADHD to his advantage with hyper focusing and attention to new details. Help him cope with overstimulation, upsetting of routines, know and communicate his limits/ feelings of being overwhelmed, etc. and help him understand how to communicate effectively when upset. Watch out for downward depression spirals- They be cray, yo.**

The only way I've managed to go from doing it 50% of the time to less than 1% of the time is by **being aware of the problem**.  When I first realized this and tried to fix it I would **do certain steps blindly twice**.  Then, another thing that helped was **putting negative numbers in parenthesis** when I changed operations, so instead of having 1 + 1 - 1 I would write 1 + 1 + (-1).  Since the +/- signs seem slightly similar and trivial at first glance I found the parenthesis made them more obvious.  Also, instead of looking at the next step on the paper try to **think about what the answer should look like** before starting to write.  Then, to see if my answer was right, I would rewrite certain steps since by the time I got to the next step I generally forgot what I just did.

"9597","Bruh. This year I‚Äôve finally caught up with actually releasing stuff and getting it properly mastered. Here‚Äôs my advice: 
1. Only release singles and only the best of the best. This way you won‚Äôt obsess over song order etc. and enable yourself to put out songs more consistently.
2. Assuming you write like I do (initial demo written and recorded in a 12 hour mad dash followed by total lack of interest in turning it into a finished song), make three ‚Äòrounds‚Äô of improvements and detail work. I‚Äôll open a project exactly three times, each time focusing on getting it as tight and finished as possible.
3. When you get feedback, you are not obliged to implement it. Sometimes it‚Äôs more important to release than to perfect - this way you‚Äôll learn and grow more. 
4. Have a clear pipeline for releasing: For me, once I‚Äôve done my three rounds of revisions, I‚Äôll do a final very conservative mixdown, then send the tracks to Cloudbounce for Mastering, then to Cdbaby for distribution and finally use Submithub for Promo. Using these services was huge for me and took away a lot of frustration. 

I hope this maybe helps, know you‚Äôre not alone as I‚Äôm sitting on about ten singles each across two projects right now as well :)","gb02pcd",1,1604409854,"2020-11-03 13:24:14"

"9601","Hydroxyzine, honestly, is a pain in the ass. I take it when I have to - it knocks me the hell out usually. But it works for anxiety, and it doesn't affect my memory recall. I take propranolol more often because I find it less impairing. 

In my experience, and your mileage may vary greatly, the physical symptoms of anxiety tend to potentiate psychological anxiety a lot. CNS stimulants cause a lot of those symptoms physiologically, which leads to a subconscious interpretation from the back of my mind as ""I must be anxious, better find the reason my hackles are raised.""

Frankly, I tend to cycle the hydroxyzine about 1.5 weeks on, one week off or so because too long and makes me impossibly groggy. The propranolol I take on sort of an as-needed basis. Apart from that I just try to keep the amount of stimulant meds I take to the minimum amount that will actually work for me. It seems to be a fairly stable routine as long as I don't miss sleep. I didn't know about the tardive dyskesia though - that's frightening. I have taken other meds that had that as a potential side effect, however, and I don't think I'm particularly prone to those sorts of extrapyramidal symptoms. Scary, though.

One last thing on the propranolol - yes, when I am having one of my rare panic attacks, it definitely makes a difference. I still have to focus and calm myself down, etc, but it helps me not have a body-brain feedback loop that prevents me from being able to do so.","ccbl6i5",2,1379618507,"2013-09-19 19:21:47"

"9609","The UK system is fundamentally different. Normally, the NHS (National Health Service) prescribes based on NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence) recommendations. Unfortunately, NICE hasn't accessed Adderall for ADHD. About all it's done is ok it's use under medical guidance.

Basically, you need to persuade a private doctor to both prescribe it and take on the malpractice risk personally. Then you need to purchase it yourself, without the buying power of the NHS behind you. This makes it ridiculously expensive compared to the NHS route, so no-one generally does it unless your have a LOT of money.

Counterpoint to this however, is that, within NICE guidelines, things get a lot easier and cheaper. You pay ¬£9.15 per prescription, no matter what is it, with an annual unlimited option available and a waiver for a lot of groups.

"9619","The American system also isn't perfect, but a lot of the horror stories are unquestionably exaggerated. What people from single payer countries are generally not told about is the charitable system in place. It's been strained more and more each time the government decides to control another part of the system, unfortunately, with doctors having trouble lowering their prices for the poor and uninsured without having to be undercharged by the government programs by a severe amount. 

Medicaid reimbursement rate differs by specialty, I've heard it tends to be about 30-60%. Reimbursement is based on the doctor's lowest rate. So if the doctor needs to charge $80 for an appointment to keep his lights on and feed his people, and the reimbursement rate is 50%, and a person who doesn't qualify for Medicaid comes in with nothing but $40 in his pocket, the doctor has to choose between not seeing the man and having Medicaid only pay him $20 per visit from now on... Or do it anyways and find ways to hide it in the paperwork, which is what they usually do.

See, we already have a system. It just isn't government controlled. What results when the government takes a hand in it is that the old system struggles to try to continue to help people, while the new system is generally built on shaky ground. The old system works very well everywhere it is used, but we are told that we should not use it and should not be able to use it. Based on outcomes? No. Based on price availability? No. Based on waiting times? No.

Based on nothing more and nothing less than whether the government controls it.

So the government tries to control it, and we wind up with craziness.

Back just thirty years ago, it was pretty easy to raise a kid and get all his routine appointments, shots, and periodic kid things like a broken leg or braces on very little money and with no health insurance at all. I have had periods of insurance and of uninsurance, but over the past few years is the first time I have been actually unable to *afford care*, and it's been because I've been insured. I wish I'd had the guts to go without, because the penalty plus care would cost way, way less than the premium, copay, and deductible.

No, what I *really* wish is that we were allowed to have is one of those old high deductible plans. These new plans basically act like them now, but cost $600/month instead of $40/month like they used to. Much of that extra money goes to pay the people the doctor has to hire to run the insurance claims and the various insurance company personnel who have to decide whether you really needed that treatment.

So I will give you this: Single payer, with all its exclusions and red tape, is probably as good or better than an unholy mix of government-enabled fascism and corporatism. But I would prefer to see health care be as affordable and available (and as cutting-edge) for the poor, the working class, the middle class, the rich as a multitude of other things that are not government-run.","dha1yux",1,1494240609,"2017-05-08 10:50:09"

"9643","Maybe its luck of the draw or my age or how I dress, but I swear every doctor I go to has the RX pad out as soon as I say adderall.


No hesitation, no probing me to determine if I take it or not. I have been going to a counselor for a year now (moved to a new state) and I finally decided to go get a physical. I tell the doc I take adderall, get it from a counselor, and before I tell him how much I take he goes "" I can always write that for you"".


We keep talking he says ""maybe the extended release would work better. If your counselor wont proscribe it, I can"".

You're right.  It's hard to make the next step because 1) I am not even sure what is the right thing to do next, but I can guess 2) I'm in a competitive and high-paced university and am always busy with papers and exams so finding the time to figure out this stuff is hard.

LOL, what's ""kiss a few frogs"" mean?

I have good university health insurance and there are social workers and other stuff.  

Option 1: Ask school psychologist what I should do for therapy and have her refer me.
-also I will make sure they don't communicate with my parents or any other doctors without my permission for each specific instance because really bad things can happen.  Once, I gave a university social worker permission to call my home-town psychiatrist to tell him I was having a rough time, and he proceeded to over-react and called my parents (never gave him permission to do this...idk if he broke a policy or not) and they freaked out and our relationship suffered severe wounds and has still not fully recovered.  Really tragic situation actually.  My home-town psychiatrist thought that I was so dysfunctional that I was unable to cope to do anything and he was expecting me to like have a breakdown and flunk out of school, but he had the totally wrong idea, but he told my parents this and they freaked out and became enraged with me for not telling them.  They still hold this against me and the feelings led to other events that slashed severe wounds in our relationship.

"9677","I will give you simplified tips to start and continue a good routine:

1) **Purchase a white board, dry-erase markers and dry erasers.** Place your new fancy whiteboard in a location you are happy with clear of clutter. This is your new white board/schedule location.

2) **Use your new white board to set up schedules for yourself.**  Date at the time, time frame of when you have the intention of doing something, and the activity you plan on doing. Suggestion; use the schedule as a way to remind you to do the things you intend to do. For example, if you think you should go to bed at 11pm but you know you intend to go to bed later then that, compromise with yourself with a time you actually intend to go to bed with. Be truthful to yourself and be happy with what you put up there.

3) **When you remember to do something, do it.**  This is your moment to do it. I know I tend to remember to do things for that split second... at that SPLIT second do it. I tend to say out loud ""OOOO"" in response to remembering.

4) **Eat and sleep well.**  I know easier said then done, however I still have to mention how important eating and sleeping is.

5) **Be happy with yourself. Do not be ashamed with your mistakes.**  otherwise its going to be that must harder to try to alter your mistakes. To err is to be human. Even go as far as you accept you are going to be filled with doubt at times... but say to yourself at these times this is not the true you.

6) **Lastly, you are likely going to play mind games with yourself to get things done and thats ok!**  I know how I will respond in certain situations so I try to use this to my advantage to get myself to do certain actions.

"9710","again i say, i'm not a doctor. but you do sound a lot like me, and different in others. we both get distracted by minor things, forgetful, nervous public speaking, speak out loud during inappropriate moments, and such. you do say one thing that a doc might look at and think anxiety when you say you worry about the future because of grades. but if you know for sure that your grades suffer due to inattention and procrastination then you should be feeling that anxiety. one thing that stands out to me against you having an anxiety disorder is that you call yourself a social butterfly and love getting to know everyone you meet; because i think a lot of folks with anxiety feel anxiety (at least a little) about being judged by strangers. for the most part that list matches up strongly with adhd symptom lists. we must not forget that anxiety is a normal human emotion that we should feel when we become aware of a problem that affects us is getting worse. it motivates us to find a way to fix it.

recently i have noticed how much more i talk than those around me and have been trying to work on it. like you said you hate silence. i feel that if it's quiet for too long i'll start a conversation and go on and on with it and irritate those around me so i've been trying to stop and think before i break silence. instead of telling an entire story i'll just try to think of an interesting single sentence to say and wait for a response before i speak again. basically try to refrain from saying more than a few sentences about something unless asked directly about it.

another thing that i've been concerned with lately myself is that my distraction type habits are getting worse. like in class i've noticed that i mindlessly scroll through my phone more often and it makes me miss parts of the lecture. and during homework (as we speak i'm working on calculus homework) i'll check random websites more often than before.

That said, I understand the time blindness thing completely - it's something I suffer from all the time (every morning, in fact, which makes getting to work on time a huge struggle, unless I medicate first thing in the morning). For me though, that meant I had to plan ahead of time knowing that this would be something I struggled with. Usually it meant breaking things down over several days on a calendar (looking at a long term project was overwhelming), scheduling my time to the hour in very busy (i.e. - finals) times, creating priority lists the night before, doing lunchtime ""check-ins"" with myself as a reset when I get distracted, using the Pomodoro technique, moving locations when I started getting restless, etc. 

Nowadays I have to set alarms after my wake-up alarm so that I stop browsing reddit in bed and missing my bus.

None of these are inherently harmful, whereas mental disorders *are*. We also cannot tolerate the rejection of the medical model of disability, which acknowledges the benefits of medicine in treating ADHD. We feel that their position erases the experiences of people with ADHD (as well as disorders like OCD), mischaracterizes the actual nature of these disorders, and ignores the associated inherent harms we deal with daily.

Love this! Although I have to admit I'm relieved my ADHD meds help with the ""bad"" symptoms but don't make me feel any less me, as I was worried that the two were so closely linked...

Sorry about your parents, I hope things get better. No idea if it's helpful for you but I got a book for my mum which had 8 case studies of people who'd been in similar situations to me, ""Smart But Stuck"", people who did well in school or up to a certain point then started struggling (e.g., at university) or who were intelligent but ADHD made it hard to show that. I highlighted the two case studies I felt were closest to me, and I think reading about it from a professional in a book about other people helped her understand a lot.

Still: there is an almost zero percent chance I'll ever speak to my dad or his side of the family about it. Nope. Not gonna happen. I'd rather hit my head against a brick wall. Same outcome (headache) without the stress and how demoralising it would be.

I do a lot of outreach and work with undergrads at my uni though, so I'll probs casually mention ADHD in future talks and stuff.

 I am able to focus more, and not distracted.  Before I would feel so overwhelmed that I didnt even know where to start.  I would jump from project to project.  And then felt like a failure because everything was half done.  The medication has allowed my mind to calm and I am able to stay on task without being to greatly distracted.

I too had the same comments from the teachers as I read over my report cards.  Needs to pay more attention, daydreaming, disorganized, unprepared, not working to potential, blah blah. I struggled to pay attention in classes I had no interest.  I knew I was different, and also thought I lacked intelligence, it was when my kids were diagnosed that it clicked. But I still didnt seek treatment.

I also was off in my head when people were talking to me and couldn't recall what they said.  I couldn't remember peoples names.  Sometimes I couldn't even follow movies or I would have to read the same thing over and over because I couldn't remember what I had just read.  

I have the anxiety and depression as well.  But now I am  much better with those as well.

"9788","&gt;I've found that even if we go out together and come back exhausted, he'll still sneak off to sit on the computer til morning. Even after sex, he'll just leave.

That part sounds worrisome to me. It's one thing to be caught up in something and not go to bed (and even to be irritated at someone asking you or reminding you to go to bed), it's another to be exhausted and in bed and still get up to go off to be on the computer. I'm not sure the best way to deal with it, but I don't think you should write off your concerns. 

I don't necessarily meant to suggest it's a sign he's doing anything nefarious. You said he works a lot, so it could be that it's his only opportunity to get time to himself and blow off steam, and staying up all night is not necessarily the intention when he goes off to be on his own. But it does sound like staying up all night is more than just an accident of hyperfocus or distraction, and something he is actively seeking. That's a sign that the underlying cause is something that may need to be addressed. Have you ever asked him why (in a non-accusatory way) he gets up out of bed to go to the computer in situations like this where he's already in bed? It might help to try to prompt more open communication, especially since the secrecy is bothersome to you.","e7xt1n4",2,1539789005,"2018-10-17 15:10:05"

"9819","That is the classic struggle for those of us with ADHD.

I recall one college chemistry class where I was the single top scorer in the entire class on exams.  I got a ""D"" because I never turned in a single lab.  :-(

Personally, I would think about just teaching my son that yes, his grades will be a little low, but that learning is the important part.  And I'd work with him on techniques to help him get more homework done, but still, I may just let grades slip a little bit as long as he's learning.

On the ""not worrying about the low grades"", As one of my mech E professors said, ""In the real world, nobody says 'Here, you have one hour to design this bridge, show all of your work, and you will get credit for whatever is finished'.  They say 'Take as much time as you need, but when this bridge is finished, it had better not fall down and kill everyone.'"" 

At the same time, any improvement he can make in actually following through on mundane ""busy work"" is likely to be a great benefit for the rest of his life, so I would not skimp on that.  We've worked on that from various angles with my son, and while it's been a LOT of work, we've seen a big improvement over the last couple of years.","ccs5c75",1,1381850195,"2013-10-15 15:16:35"

In all likelihood, you either don't have ADHD, or if you DO have it, your symptoms may have been overlooked (which is common in those with higher-than-average intelligence, since they find ways to coast by).

Glucose (sugar) and the ketones are only energy sources brain can consume. And ketones are only secondary back up system to keep brain fed. Already from that point of view, the ketodiet being marketed as super diet for brain is slightly misleading. It is the last resort of the body to feed the brain, when no glucose is available so you don't pass out or worse.

Getting glucose doesn't mean direct sugar btw, you get in from fruits, vegs and aside fiber the carbs will be converted to glucose for your body. Slower the break up to glucose, better the glucose balance will be and you won't get the crash that follows high blood sugar and high insulin peak it causes.

From experience, sugar has helped me stay focused. Having prunes or raisins to nom while scramming was what I used to do as a teen. That is ofc just one person's experience as well. You can get your sugar from a carrot or apple too, so you can (and maybe should) do your brain feeding healthy path anyway.

Also as biochemist, you won't get past the ketoflu. Keto diet is not something you should be on permanently and it is one of the few diets you ought to consult a doctor, when considering. It can temporarily reboot insulin system and hence is good idea for diabetics, but it is a stress mode for the whole body. Hence, even when recommended, it is not permanent diet. 

EDIT: Also, as long as you consume carbs, your body won't enter ketosis. Since the ketosis exactly is a lack of glucose for energy source. I truly call hoax on the OP's claims about a nutrient extra that does that despite the glucose intake.","dnj20m8",3,1506430350,"2017-09-26 12:52:30"

"9869","I broke my nose like... 15 years ago and the cartilage on my septum joined back in a weird angle that partially blocks both of my nostrils. It has given me a bunch of trouble breathing (I have other nasal issues that interact with this too) which also translated into trouble sleeping. I went to ENT specialists a bunch of times because I had trouble doing exercise (when I tried breathing strongly through the nose it just folded inwards and my right inner nostril sealed itself against the cartilage). And I've experienced the nasal cycle (even though this is the first time I've heard of it, it's definitely something I've been noticing almost daily for 10 years or more), and having trouble breathing sure makes my brain go into meltdown, but, seriously, it's... not mistakable for ADHD.

I mean, I'm sure it's making stuff worse because having your brain feel like meat jelly and feeling like you're constantly running out of fuel does a number on your ability to focus or even keep a casual conversation going (I know this from experience), but I mean, ADHD is more than just having trouble focusing or feeling slow, it's something that changes your baseline performance. It's probably worth looking into it anyways, but I'm not sure if it's going to solve a lot of stuff.

(by the way, just checked because the way you said it sounded pretty weird: it's not that one nostril breathes in and other breathes out, that just can't happen, it's just that one nostril is somewhat blocked and the other is less blocked)

In any case, have you tried ""manually"" unblocking your blocked nostril when this happens? I don't mean ""grab your nostril and pull"" (that works though, but it looks dumb if you hold it for a long time), what I do is, since I used to rest my head on my hand in class (and I still do it anytime I'm sitting at a table), I press somewhere around my cheekbone (closer to the nose is better, but anywhere is ok) with a finger, my thumb, the outer side of my palm, etc. and then pull ""outwards"" or ""backwards"" (towards my ear, pretty much, but pulling down away from the eye also works) that way I pull the ""walls"" of my nostril away from my septum and undo part of the blockage. It might not work for you if your case is more severe, but it usually works very well for me and helps me breathe better when I start feeling ""slow"". When my nose is acting up I even sleep with my arm just haphazardly thrown over my face so its weight pulls my skin and forcibly opens one nostril so I can sleep in relative peace.","ecmgdm3",1,1545870766,"2018-12-27 00:32:46"

"9876","I think to some extent, as well, something about ADHD makes you always feel like you're in a rush.

For example, I've seen my partner have plenty of time to get dressed for work, but still go through 5 different shirts for the day when the first one worked just fine, because he's very indecisive about what he should wear for the day. By the 5th one, he's late. I used to have to get up 30minutes before him so I could shower, be ready fully for work and pack his lunch so we both could get to work on time. I know 30 minutes doesn't seem like much, but he's on stimulants, I'm not, and we usually went to sleep around the same time.

So, after 5x the normal decisions you'd be making for getting ready in the morning, he finally settles on a shirt for the day and we rush out of the house just barely on time, while he puts on his shoes in the car.

it got better when I established a time he had to be awake by and getting dressed, putting his shoes on etc 5 minutes before it's time to leave, but still sucked at recognizing JUST PICK A SHIRT IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT MUCH.

REMEMBER DONT TELL YOUR FRIEND/college class mate OR Feel SUPERIOR HAVING ADHD MEDS, Remember depending where you are living selling or giving away your medication its a felony for its a class 2 narcotic even if you are underage. Dont forget to check on check your blood pressure  and bp. Remember the first days or week effect of the adhd medication are not the real effect of the drugs, the euphoria created by the drug will wear off, and those arent the effect that you should look when taking adhd meds or else you are looking for creational use. ah depending how old you are most doctor will make you take another adhd exam and those are pretty expensive, but as I said it depends on your case. If you get an XR (long release) medication dont take it after 6pm or else it you will have a hard time going to sleep. and THE MOST IMPORTANT  thing you should remember is RESPECT ADHD DRUGS!! Many individuals use the medication for they don't have any choice, for the most mundane task can become difficult and dont get an advantage from using them. As well,  ADHD drugs can badly backfire if you abuse it, you can become addicted, develop heart problems  get tolerance, meaning you will need more pill in order to get the ""usual"" effect from its. That is why you dont need to double up on your prescribed dose. I was on 10 year hiatus from the drug I tried to look information in my college campus on how would I get prescribed ADHD drugs, again it was a long journey I needed to take a new ADHD test ,that cost about 1,000$ and if I didnt pass it, it meant no medication and I be short 1000$.

"9886","Hey, 
tl;dr Don‚Äôt worry. 

she‚Äôs very ‚Äòout of sight out of mind‚Äô about her connections. 
Honestly, your choice of words couldn‚Äôt be anymore precise. 

I have inattentive ADHD and I can attest that It is actually like that. I miss people ONLY when they are around me. As weird as it sounds, it‚Äôs true. But doesn‚Äôt mean my life is a series of episodes where only new guests keep coming. I do have connections which are lifelong and I go back to them often. 

How is that relatable to your romantic life? 
Well, people with ADHD are well aware of their instability. In fact they end up hating it every now and then. They need an Anchor, more than anyone. For me it‚Äôs my family. Wherever I am in the world and whatever I‚Äôm going through, if sense of instability or not-belonging hits, I crave home. It also serves as reality check for me and a very important tool for self assessment. You HAVE to be all this for your partner. If this isn‚Äôt instinctively happening in your relationship, you have to take conscious efforts. By now you must be well used to what they generally call ‚Äòwhims and fancies‚Äô and also the fact that people with ADHD need some creative freedom, they can be unpredictable and that they may actually be pretty inconsistent but if she‚Äôs with you for so many days then you obviously understand what I mean by anchor.. 

If your relationship is still at the level where ‚Äòshe‚Äôs fixated at you‚Äô, you‚Äôll of course worry that what if she gets fixated at someone else? 
But if you are taking it to anchoring level, She‚Äôs going no where. It‚Äôs easy to be fixated at anyone but equally difficult to feel connected to someone.

(playing devil's advocate) I don't know how often you share with these people, but it is important to know when you are oversharing.

"9907","One of the best tips I've read for ADHD is this. 

The big problem is that we can't handle too many responsibilities simultaneously, because we generally try to process everything all at once right now, instead of planning things out systematically or prioritizing. This is the difficulty, and why we never manage to start things, or start one thing and drop everything else, or focus briefly on self-improvement techniques while unintentionally letting all of our responsibilities slide while we're at it. (This is what I do, and sounds like your issue as well). 

In the past, I've always tried to solve my problems by incidentally collecting more responsibility.  I've always thought if I have more money or a better job or a bigger house that I will be happier.  The good old American Dream! 

At the end of the day though, I couldn't manage my extremely challenging career, managing upkeep on my home, spending energy on my family, and not being able to get anything for myself because I'm too preoccupied trying to meet the needs of other people.  

I've learned to think of responsibility like budgeting or a credit card balance.  I know I always take on more than I can handle, so I've been working to minimize my possessions, live a more simple life, and I'm seeking a career with less responsibility (and less money most likely)  So that I have the ability to focus on myself, and my improvement, and I still have the energy to focus on my kids as well.   Before I make a decision, I work to carefully look at what is already on my plate, and whether or not I'm capable of taking on the extra responsibilities, knowing that it's difficult for me to deliver on things I'm responsible for. 

In your case, you're taking on a new responsibility:  Setting time aside for self-improvement and self-compassion.  This is a great thing to  do!  The problem is most likely that you already have an over-flowing plate of shit that you need to be doing that isn't sitting on your butt breathing.  Those responsibilities you already have will push out anything new eventually, or will come back to haunt you.   

So. in short. Try to take a look at your life. Cut out as much  unnecessary or overly taxing small responsibilities you can. Then when you feel like you can handle everything with room to spare, start adding SLOWLY.   

You can't fix everything at once.  Take your time. Try your best!","dtdhtw3",3,1517165725,"2018-01-28 18:55:25"
"9908","Sometimes a stimulant can help lessen the impact of that crash.  For me this is some kind of caffeine input, however this does not work for everyone.  Someone already mentioned tea, I prefer black coffee.

I would  I try to steer clear of redbull (too much caffeine will worsen the problem).  

What you have said makes it seem much more serious than what happens to me though, but one thing that helped me in high school was meditation.

"9919","Started with 30mg  Vyvanse
Huge difference from 10mg Ritalin. Benefits only stuck around the first two weeks, and I felt sluggish at night.  At the 3 week point I began having terrible head aches and was exhausted at the end of the workday.

Bumped up to 40mg (been on this for 3? months now)  
Felt all the original benefits when I switched from 10mg Ritalin to 30mg Vyvanse - again only lasted the first two weeks, except this time the focus seemed to stay.  
This Time the headaches picked up though, terrible and unmanageable so I started taking 5htp in the mornings, eventually adding l-tyrosine as well and that seemed to solve the head aches and staved off the exhaustion.

With work picking up like it did in November and the Holidays, I wanted to wait to ask about increasing my dose.  

The focus has been fading as time passes. The memory benefits I first experienced, are non-existent now - which makes me a little sad tbh. I know I'll be asking for a doseage increase, but I'm frustrated I can't find the thing to help with memory.","cnzyur8",1,1422159334,"2015-01-25 04:15:34"

I caved and bought the habit tracker ""Streaks"" about half an hour ago. Very minimal interface, I like it so far! I use Duolingo to learn a language, and I found that the idea of ""streaks"" really works well with my brain.

I sometimes use ""tasks"" in Google Calendar - I find it handy because it carries it over to the next day and the next day until you check it off. I know a few people who prefer having things on paper though, for a number of reasons. I think there is research that writing on paper makes you better able to remember things?

"9946","A sticker chart building up to a big reward would definitely be worth trying. The key is to trigger that reward stimulation in the brain as close as possible to the desired behavior, so even something small like putting a sticker on a chart builds that association, and then the big reward makes those small rewards meaningful so they don't lose potency.

The two main issues at play are, as I mentioned, a failure to association action and result across time, and a shorter duration of stimulation. The satisfaction from the reward doesn't last as long, and so the reinforcement is weaker. Lots of repeated stimulations, though, can be sustained.

Think of it like the game where you keep a balloon in the air by hitting it up repeatedly. If you're outside, you can hit the balloon high in the air infrequently, but if you're inside, the ceiling stops the balloon from going too high, so smaller, repeated hits are more effective.","d86n30x",3,1475134106,"2016-09-29 07:28:26"

"9971","I am on 40mg of Vyvanse a day as well and I feel where you're coming from.

The medication certainly helps me- my mood is through the roof, I'm happy, focusing on a task is next to none and I'll tell you, my to do list never sees more check marks next to the items than when I've taken my Vyvanse. But the problem is that if I take my meds, it is very easy to focus on the wrong thing.

I've boiled it down to this: 

When on Vyvanse, I have a surge of motivation and concentration to get things done. And because of this, I want to get EVERYTHING done.

It took me a while to figure out how to focus on what actually NEEDS doing, and I noticed that, for me, it takes about an hour for my Vyvanse to kick in. So if I take it, and then roughly 30min later start working on a task I need to do, then ~30min later when it takes effect, I am already working on something and it is much easier to stay on that task.

I hope this helps.

When I don't take my meds its significantly worse. Taking my med help it a lot. But recently it isn't helping enough, even taking a little higher dose helps a little. Not nearly enough. 

Before: wake up full of energy  

After without: feel sick, unhappy, don't want to do any thing. 

After with meds: feel better, but no energy, able to get ready for the day and shower but it takes me a few hours to be able to do it. 

I'm able to focus very well on my current dose. But I don't have energy or motivation to do things. Which fucking sucks right now. 
Managing ADHD (not to mention chronic pain so I can't go for runs anymore) is much harder than I thought. I had no idea how much my mom was actually helping me.  

I had a very certain schedule. 
Time A-Time B high school (which is a fucking joke why the fuck is high school so easy!?!) 
Time B- Time C walk dogs, trash, chore stuff. 
Time C - D in my room until work or community college classes. 
Home then sleep. 

She helped keep me on a schedule and helped me transition between tasks. On meds I get hyper focused on the task at hand. Felt kinda like a child though. 

I need someone to check me for I reck myself. You know?

It sounds like it might be time to unbox those feelings and deal with them. Possibly even confront the source and have that reckoning. 

Essentially, you're trying to tell your inner outrage to ""just cl calm down."" And when's the last time that worked on someone hysterically angry and repressed who knows they are justified in their position? ""No, fuck that. Don't tell me to calm down. This has been bothering us for too long and now we can't stop reliving it all because we've got a child,"" is what I hear your brain and heart telling you. 

More than likely, it'll be good to take the emotional dive. It'll be *incredibly* positive for your kid in that you'll be far less likely to inadvertently repeat the ways of your father if you can work through it instead of trying in vain to continue repressing.

Preachy, yeah, sorry. But repression is a form if emotional cancer. It'll only get worse until it starts to really effect everyone around you.
